PART I

ITEMS 1. & 2. BUSINESS & PROPERTIES

Overview

. Valero Energy Corporation is a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, Texas, with
2004 total revenues of $54.6 billion. On January 31, 2005, Valero had 19,797 employees. Its
principal executive offices are at One Valero Way, San Antonio, Texas, 78249, and its telephone
number is (210) 345-2000. Valero’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “VLO.” Valero was incorporated in Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero Refining and
Marketing Company. On August 1, 1997, its name was changed to Valero Energy Corporation. When
used in this report, the term “Valero” may refer, depending upon the context, to Valero Energy
Corporation, to one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole.

Valero owns and operates 15 refineries having a combined throughput capacity, including crude oil
and other feedstocks, of approximately 2.5 million barrels per day (BPD). Valero’s refining
network extends from eastern Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast and includes the island
of Aruba. Valero produces premium, environmentally clean refined products such as reformulated
gasoline (RFG), gasoline meeting the specifications of the California Air Resources Board (CARB),
CARB diesel fuel, low-sulfur diesel fuel and oxygenates (liquid hydrocarbon compounds containing
oxygen). Valero also produces conventional gasolines, distillates, jet fuel, asphalt and
petrochemicals.

Valero is also a leading marketer of refined products. Valero markets branded and unbranded
refined products on a wholesale basis in the United States and Canada through an extensive bulk and
rack marketing network. Valero also sells refined products through a network of more than 4,700
retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States, Canada and Aruba. Valero’s retail
operations include approximately 1,500 company-operated sites that sell transportation fuels and
convenience store merchandise.



Through agreements with Valero L.P., Valero has access to a logistics system that complements
Valero’s refining and marketing business primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast, West Coast and
Mid-Continent regions. Valero L.P. is a publicly traded, master limited partnership (NYSE: VLI)
that owns and operates crude oil pipelines, crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage
facilities, and refined product pipelines and terminals primarily in Texas, California, Oklahoma,
New Mexico and Colorado. Valero owns approximately 46% of Valero L.P., which includes the 2%

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Stock Split

.

On July 15, 2004, Valero’s board of directors approved a two-for-one split of
Valero’s common stock. The stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock
dividend was distributed on October 7, 2004 to stockholders of record on September 23, 2004. All
share and per share data (except par value) in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the
effect of the stock split for all periods presented.

Aruba Refinery.

On March 5, 2004, Valero purchased El Paso Corporation’s Aruba refinery and
related marine, bunkering and marketing operations (collectively, the Aruba Acquisition) for $465
million plus approximately $168 million for working capital. The working capital amount excludes
$67.8 million paid by Valero related to certain refined product inventories owned by a third-party
marketing firm under an agreement in existence on the date of acquisition. The refinery generally
processes heavy, sour crude oil, and produces primarily intermediate feedstocks and finished
distillate products. Significant amounts of the refinery’s intermediate feedstock production are
used for processing in Valero’s other refineries in the Gulf Coast, West Coast and Northeast
regions. The Aruba Acquisition was funded from cash on hand ($200 million), borrowings under bank
credit facilities (approximately $27 million) and net proceeds (approximately $406 million) from a
public offering of 15.6 million shares of Valero common stock. The $67.8 million paid to the
third-party marketing firm described above was funded through borrowings under Valero’s existing
bank credit facilities.

Valero L.P.’s Proposed Acquisition of Kaneb

.

On November 1, 2004, Valero L.P. announced a proposed
merger valued at approximately $2.8 billion in which Valero L.P. will acquire Kaneb Services LLC
and Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005.
Valero expects to contribute approximately $28 million to Valero L.P. to maintain Valero’s 2%
general partner interest in Valero L.P., and Valero’s total ownership interest in Valero L.P. is
anticipated to be reduced to approximately 23% as a result of the merger.



SEGMENTS

Valero’s reportable business segments are refining and retail. Valero’s refining segment includes
refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation
operations. The refining segment is segregated geographically into the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent,
West Coast and Northeast regions.

Valero’s retail segment includes company-operated convenience stores, Canadian dealers/jobbers,
truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities and home heating oil operations. The retail segment is
segregated into two geographic regions. Valero’s retail operations in eastern Canada are referred
to as the Northeast System. Valero’s retail operations in the United States are referred to as the
U.S. System. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information
about Valero’s segments.

Intermediate, a benchmark crude oil. In 2004, sour crude oils and resid represented 55% of
Valero’s feedstock slate, sweet crude oils represented 29%, and the remaining 16% was composed of
blendstocks and other feedstocks.

Valero’s refineries produce gasolines, distillates, petrochemical feedstocks, asphalt, lubricants
and other refined products. In 2004, gasolines and blendstocks represented 48% of Valero’s refined
product slate. Distillates – such as home heating oil, diesel fuel and jet fuel – represented 30%,
while asphalt, lubricants, petrochemicals and other heavy products comprised the remaining 22%. Of
the gasoline that Valero produced in 2004, approximately 37% was reformulated gasoline and CARB
gasoline, which sell at a premium over conventional grades of gasoline. In 2004 approximately 79%
of Valero’s distillate slate was low-sulfur diesel, CARB diesel and jet fuel, which sell at a
premium over high-sulfur heating oil.

Corpus Christi East and West Refineries

. The Corpus Christi East and West Refineries are
located along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel on the Texas Gulf Coast. The West Refinery is a
highly complex refinery that specializes in processing primarily lower-cost sour crude oil and
resid into premium products such as RFG and RBOB.


The East Refinery is also a complex
refinery that processes heavy, high-sulfur crude oil into conventional gasoline, diesel, jet fuel,
asphalt, aromatics and other light products. Valero has been operating the East Refinery since
2001 and has substantially integrated the operations of the West Refinery and the East Refinery,
allowing for the transfer of various feedstocks and blending components between the two refineries
and the sharing of resources. The refineries typically receive and deliver feedstocks and products
by tanker and barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. In
addition, an eight-bay truck rack services local markets. The refineries distribute refined
products using the Colonial, Explorer, Valley and other major pipelines, including pipelines owned
by Valero L.P.


RBOB is a base unfinished reformulated
gasoline mixture known as “reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate
blending” or “RBOB.”



Aruba Refinery

. The Aruba Refinery is located on the island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea. It
generally processes heavy, sour crude oil, and produces primarily intermediate feedstocks and
finished distillate products. Significant amounts of the refinery’s intermediate feedstock
production are used for processing in Valero’s other refineries in the Gulf Coast, West Coast and
Northeast regions. The Aruba Refinery receives crude oil by ship at its two deepwater marine docks
which can berth ultra-large crude carriers. The refinery’s products are delivered by ship
primarily into markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida, the New York Harbor, the Caribbean and
Europe.

Texas City Refinery

. The Texas City Refinery is located southeast of Houston on the Texas City
Ship Channel. The Texas City Refinery processes primarily sour crude oils into a wide slate of
products. A 45,000 BPD coking unit and related facilities began operations at the refinery in the
fourth quarter of 2003, and enables the refinery to process heavier, lower-cost crude oils. The
refinery typically receives and delivers its feedstocks and products by tanker and barge via
deepwater docking facilities along the Texas City Ship Channel and also has access to the Colonial,
Explorer and TEPPCO pipelines for distribution of its products.

St. Charles Refinery

. The St. Charles Refinery is located approximately 15 miles from New Orleans
along the Mississippi River. The refinery processes sour crude oils and other feedstocks into a
high percentage of gasoline, distillates and other light products. The refinery receives crude oil
over five marine docks and has access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port where it can receive crude
oil through a 24-inch pipeline. Finished products can be shipped over these docks or by pipeline
into either the Plantation or Colonial pipeline network for distribution to the eastern United
States.

Houston Refinery

. The Houston Refinery is located on the Houston Ship Channel. It generally
processes sour crude oils and low-sulfur resid into conventional gasoline and distillates. The
plant also produces roofing-grade asphalt. The refinery typically receives its feedstocks via
tanker at deepwater docking facilities along the Houston Ship Channel. The refinery primarily
delivers its products through major refined-product pipelines, including the Colonial, Explorer and
TEPPCO pipelines.

Three Rivers Refinery

. The Three Rivers Refinery is located in South Texas between Corpus Christi
and San Antonio. It generally processes heavy sweet and sour crude oils into conventional gasoline
and distillates. The Three Rivers Refinery has access to crude oil from foreign sources delivered
to the Texas Gulf Coast at Corpus Christi as well as crude oil from domestic sources through
third-party pipelines. A 70-mile pipeline that can deliver 120,000 BPD of crude oil connects the
Three Rivers Refinery to Corpus Christi. Valero distributes refined products produced at this
refinery primarily through pipelines owned by Valero L.P.

Krotz Springs Refinery

. The Krotz Springs Refinery is located between Baton Rouge and Lafayette,
Louisiana on the Atchafalaya River. It generally processes sweet crude oils (received primarily by
pipeline and barge) into conventional gasoline and distillates. The refinery’s location provides
access to upriver markets on the Mississippi River, and its docking facilities along the
Atchafalaya River are sufficiently deep to allow barge access. The facility also uses the Colonial
pipeline to transport products to markets in the Southeast and Northeast.



West Coast

The following table presents the percentages of principal feedstock charges and product yields (on
a combined basis) for the two refineries in this region for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Jean Gaulin Refinery

. The Jean Gaulin Refinery is located in Lévis, Canada (near Quebec
City). It generally processes sweet crude oils and lower-quality, light sweet acidic crude oils
into conventional gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, heating oil and propane. The refinery
receives crude oil by ship at its deepwater dock on the St. Lawrence River. Valero charters large
ice-strengthened, double-hulled crude oil tankers that can navigate the St. Lawrence River
year-round. The refinery’s production is transported primarily by train to markets in Quebec and
New Brunswick, and by tankers and trucks primarily to markets in Canada’s Atlantic Provinces.

Paulsboro Refinery

. The Paulsboro Refinery is located in Paulsboro, New Jersey, approximately 15
miles south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River. The refinery processes primarily sour crude
oils into a wide slate of products including gasoline, distillates, a variety of lube oil
basestocks, asphalt and fuel oil. Feedstocks and refined products are typically transported by
tanker and barge via refinery-owned dock facilities along the Delaware River, Exxon Mobil
Corporation’s product distribution system, an onsite truck rack, railcars and the Colonial
pipeline, which allows products to be sold into the New York Harbor market.



Feedstock Supply

Approximately 70% of Valero’s crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts
while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market. Valero’s term supply
agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at market-related prices directly or
indirectly from various foreign national oil companies (including feedstocks originating in Saudi
Arabia, Mexico, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, Ecuador and Africa) as well as international and domestic
oil companies. About 75% of these crude oil feedstocks are imported from foreign sources and about
25% are domestic. In the event Valero becomes unable to purchase crude oil from any one of these
sources, Valero believes that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available.

The U.S. network of crude oil pipelines and terminals (including those facilities owned by Valero
L.P.) allows Valero to acquire crude oil from producing leases, domestic crude oil trading centers
and ships delivering cargoes of foreign and domestic crude oil. Valero’s Jean Gaulin Refinery
relies on foreign crude oil that is delivered to its St. Lawrence River dock facility by ship.

Valero’s cost to acquire feedstocks, and the price for which Valero ultimately can sell refined
products, depend on a number of factors beyond Valero’s control, including regional and global
supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other feedstocks and refined products.
These in turn are dependent upon, among other things, the availability of imports, the production
levels of domestic and foreign suppliers, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political
affairs and the extent of governmental regulation. Valero uses the futures market to manage a
portion of the price risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of its delivery date and in
maintaining Valero’s inventories of crude oils and refined products.

Refining Segment Sales

Valero’s refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk
markets. These sales include refined products that are manufactured in Valero’s refining
operations as well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most
of Valero’s refineries have access to deepwater transportation facilities and interconnect with
common-carrier pipeline systems, allowing Valero to sell products in most major geographic regions
of the United States and eastern Canada. No customer accounted for more than 10% of Valero’s total
operating revenues in 2004.

Wholesale Marketing

Valero is a leading wholesale marketer of branded and unbranded transportation fuels. Valero
markets these fuels on a wholesale basis in about 40 states primarily through an extensive rack
marketing network. The principal purchasers of Valero’s transportation fuels from terminal truck
racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers and truck-delivered end users throughout the United
States.

The majority of Valero’s rack volumes are sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold
to distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero brand family. In the United States,
these distributors and dealers operate approximately 2,700 branded sites (representing currently
branded sites and sites under contract for branding with Valero). These sites are independently
owned and are supplied by Valero under multi-year contracts. For wholesale branded sites, Valero
promotes its Valero

®

and Beacon

®

brands in California, and its
Valero

®

and Shamrock

®

brands on the U.S. east coast. Elsewhere in the United
States, Valero promotes its Diamond Shamrock

®

and Shamrock

®

brands.



Valero also sells a variety of other products produced at its refineries including asphalt, lube
base oils and commodity petrochemicals. These products are transported via pipelines, barges,
trucks and railcars.

Valero produces approximately 60,000 BPD of asphalt which is sold to customers in the paving and
roofing industries. Valero is the second largest producer of asphalt in the United States. Valero
produces asphalt at nine refineries and markets asphalt in 20 states through 14 terminal
facilities.

Lubricant base oils and process oils are produced at Valero’s Paulsboro Refinery. The refinery can
produce 12,000 BPD of highly refined paraffinic and aromatic oils for use in a variety of lubricant
and process applications. These products are sold to a variety of customers, including ExxonMobil
under a long-term agreement. ExxonMobil purchases about 40% of the Paulsboro Refinery’s lubricant
oil production with the balance sold to independent blenders, additive manufacturers, and
industrial and marine customers.

Valero produces and markets a variety of commodity petrochemicals including aromatic solvents
(benzene, toluene and xylene), refinery- and chemical-grade propylene and anhydrous ammonia.
Aromatic solvents and propylene are sold to customers in the chemical industry for further
processing into such products as paints, plastics and adhesives. Ammonia, produced at Valero’s
McKee Refinery, is sold to customers in the agriculture industry to be used as fertilizer. Valero
also sells petroleum coke and sulfur to domestic and international customers principally in the
utility and agricultural sectors, respectively.

Product Supply and Trading

Valero sells a significant portion of its gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales
channels. Valero’s bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain
bulk end-users such as railroads, airlines and utilities. Valero’s bulk sales are transported
primarily by pipeline, barges and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs.

Valero also enters into refined product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements enable
Valero to minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined product
availability, broaden geographic distribution and sell to markets not connected to Valero’s or
Valero L.P.’s refined product pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of
refined products by Valero to unaffiliated companies at Valero’s and third parties’ terminals in
exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to Valero by these unaffiliated
companies at specified locations. Purchase agreements involve Valero’s purchase of refined
products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations. Most of these
agreements are long-standing arrangements. However, they generally can be terminated with 30 to 90
days notice. Valero does not anticipate an interruption in its ability to exchange or purchase
refined products in the near future.



RETAIL

Valero’s retail segment operations include the following:

•

sales of transportation fuels at retail stores and unattended self-service cardlocks,

•

sales of convenience store merchandise in retail stores, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

Valero is one of the largest independent retailers of refined products in the central and southwest
United States and eastern Canada. Valero’s retail operations are supported by Valero’s proprietary
credit card program which had approximately 750,000 accounts as of December 31, 2004. Valero’s
retail operations are segregated geographically into two groups: the U.S. System and the Northeast
System.

U.S. System

Sales in the U.S. System represent sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise
through Valero’s company-operated retail sites. For the year ended December 31, 2004, total sales
of refined products through the U.S. System’s retail sites averaged approximately 122,000 BPD. On
December 31, 2004, Valero had 1,043 company-operated sites in its U.S. System (of which
approximately 75% were owned and 25% were leased). Valero’s company-operated stores are operated
primarily under the brand names Corner Store

®

and Stop N Go

®

. Transportation
fuels sold in Valero’s U.S. System stores are sold primarily under the brands Valero

®

and Diamond Shamrock

®

.

In addition to transportation fuels, Valero’s company-operated convenience stores sell snacks,
candy, beer, fast foods, cigarettes and fountain drinks. Valero maintains an ongoing program to
modernize and upgrade the convenience stores it operates, to identify appropriate markets for
further investment, and to identify under-performing stores where future investment is deemed
non-strategic. In 2004, Valero opened 10 new stores, re-imaged and upgraded 146 stores, closed 112
stores, and divested 152 stores (some of which had been closed in prior years).

Northeast System

Sales in Valero’s Northeast System include the following:

•

sales of refined products and convenience store merchandise through Valero’s
company-operated retail sites and cardlocks,

•

sales of refined products through sites owned by independent dealers and jobbers, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

Valero’s Northeast System includes retail operations in eastern Canada where Valero is a major
supplier of refined products serving Quebec, Ontario and the Atlantic Provinces of Newfoundland,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. For the year ended December 31, 2004, total
retail sales of refined products through the Northeast System averaged approximately 77,000 BPD.
Gasoline and diesel fuel are sold under the Ultramar

®

brand through a network of
approximately 1,025 outlets throughout eastern Canada. On December 31, 2004, Valero owned or
leased approximately 470 retail stores in the Northeast System and distributed gasoline to
approximately 555 dealers and independent jobbers. In addition, the Northeast System operated 87
cardlocks, which are card- or key-activated, self-service, unattended stations that allow the
purchase of gasoline and diesel fuel 24 hours a day. The Northeast System operations also include
a large home heating oil business that provides home heating oil to approximately 180,000
households in eastern Canada. Valero’s home heating oil business tends to be seasonal to the
extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter.



COMPETITION

The refining and marketing industry continues to be highly competitive. Valero’s competitors
include fully integrated major oil companies (

e.g.

, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips) and other
independent refining and marketing entities (

e.g.

, Sunoco and Premcor) that operate in all of
Valero’s market areas. Many of Valero’s competitors are engaged on a national or international
basis in many segments of the petroleum business, including exploration, production,
transportation, refining and marketing, on scales much larger than Valero’s. These competitors may
have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of
these segments. All of Valero’s crude oil and feedstock supplies are purchased from third-party
sources, while some competitors have proprietary sources of crude oil available for their own
refineries.

Financial returns in the refining and marketing industry depend largely on refining margins and
retail fuel margins, both of which fluctuate significantly. Refining margins are impacted by
levels of refined product inventories, the balance of refined product supply and demand, quantities
of refined product imports, and utilization rates of domestic refineries. Historically, refining
margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Valero’s
ability to process significant amounts of sour crude oils enhances Valero’s competitive position in
the industry relative to refiners that process primarily sweet crude oils because sour crude oils
typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oils.

Valero’s retail business faces competition from fully integrated major oil companies and
independent jobbers selling gasoline under national and private brands. Valero also competes with
large grocery stores and other merchandisers (the so-called “hypermarts”) that also sell
transportation fuels.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The principal environmental risks associated with Valero’s operations are emissions into the air
and releases into the soil, surface water or groundwater. Valero’s operations are subject to
environmental regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and numerous federal,
state and local authorities under extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste
management, pollution prevention and characteristics and compositions of fuels. The significant
federal laws applicable to Valero’s operations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). A discussion of
significant environmental regulations affecting Valero’s operations follows.

EPA’s Tier II Gasoline and Diesel Standards

. The EPA’s Tier II standards, adopted under the Clean
Air Act, phase in limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline (which began in 2004) and diesel
fuel sold to highway consumers (beginning in 2006). Most of Valero’s refineries are being modified
to comply with the Tier II gasoline and diesel standards. Valero believes that capital
expenditures of approximately $2 billion will be required through 2008 for its refineries to meet
the Tier II specifications, of which approximately $790 million has been spent through December 31,
2004. This estimate includes amounts related to projects at three Valero refineries to provide
hydrogen necessary for removing sulfur from gasoline and diesel. Valero expects that its cost
estimates will change as additional engineering is completed and progress is made toward
construction of these various projects.



EPA’s Section 114 Initiative.

In 2000, the EPA issued to a majority of refiners operating in the
United States a series of information requests pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act as part
of an enforcement initiative. Valero received a Section 114 information request pertaining to all
of its refineries owned at that time. Valero completed its response to the request, and it has not
been named in any enforcement proceeding by the EPA. Several other refiners, however, have either
reached global settlements with the EPA regarding this enforcement initiative or have been subject
to enforcement proceedings by the EPA. Valero believes that it will be able to reach a settlement
with the EPA during 2005 applicable to all of its U.S. refineries. Valero expects to incur
penalties and related expenses in connection with a potential settlement, but Valero believes that
any settlement penalties will be immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial
position. In addition, Valero expects that a settlement of this matter will require significant
capital improvements or changes in operating parameters, or both, at most of Valero’s refineries.
However, Valero expects that most of the required capital improvements or changes in operating
parameters will be consistent with many of Valero’s existing or forecasted strategic capital
projects or emission reduction projects already planned for the next several years.

Houston/Galveston SIP

. Valero’s Houston and Texas City Refineries are located in the
Houston/Galveston area, which is classified as “severe nonattainment” for compliance with the EPA’s
one-hour air-quality standard for ozone. In October 2001, the EPA approved a State Implementation
Plan (SIP) to bring the Houston/Galveston area into compliance with the one-hour ozone standard by
2007. The EPA-approved plan was based on a requirement for industry sources to reduce emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 90% from a 1997-1999 average actual emissions baseline. Certain industry
and business groups challenged the plan based on technical feasibility of the 90% NOx control and
its effectiveness in achieving compliance with the ozone standard. In December 2002, the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) adopted a revised approach for the Houston/Galveston
SIP. This alternative plan requires an 80% reduction in NOx emissions and a 64% reduction in
so-called highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC). This alternative plan is subject to
EPA review and approval. Valero will be required to install NOx and HRVOC control and monitoring
equipment and implement certain operating practices by 2007 at its Houston and Texas City
Refineries at a cost estimated by Valero to be approximately $68 million based on the proposed TCEQ
approach.

Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental Regulations

. In 2004, Valero’s
capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were approximately
$523 million, and are currently estimated to be approximately $900 million for 2005 and
approximately $745 million for 2006. The estimates for 2005 and 2006 do not include amounts
related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures relating to compliance with
environmental regulations is not determinable.

Government regulations are complex, are subject to different interpretations and are becoming
increasingly more stringent. Therefore, future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could
result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital
expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition,
because certain air emissions at Valero’s refineries have been grandfathered under particular
environmental laws, any major upgrades at any of its refineries could require potentially material
additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations.



PROPERTIES

Valero’s principal properties are described above under the caption “Valero’s Operations.” In
addition, Valero owns feedstock and refined product storage facilities in various locations.
Valero believes that its properties and facilities are generally adequate for its operations and
that its facilities are maintained in a good state of repair. As of December 31, 2004, Valero was
the lessee under a number of cancelable and non-cancelable leases for certain properties. Valero’s
leases are discussed more fully in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valero’s patents relating to its refining operations are not material to Valero as a whole. The
trademarks and tradenames under which Valero conducts its retail and branded wholesale business –
including Valero

®

, Diamond Shamrock

®

, Shamrock

– and
other trademarks employed in the marketing of petroleum products are important to Valero’s
wholesale and retail marketing operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Unocal

Union Oil Company of California v. Valero Energy Corporation

, United States District Court, Central
District of California (filed January 22, 2002). In 2002, Union Oil Company of California (Unocal)
sued Valero alleging patent infringement. The complaint seeks a 5.75 cent per gallon royalty on
all reformulated gasoline infringing on Unocal’s '393 and
'126 patents. These patents cover
certain compositions of cleaner-burning gasoline. The complaint seeks treble damages for Valero’s
alleged willful infringement of Unocal’s patents and Valero’s alleged conduct to induce others to
infringe the patents. In a previous lawsuit involving its '393 patent, Unocal prevailed against
five other major refiners.

In 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began an antitrust investigation concerning Unocal’s
misconduct with a joint industry research group and regulators during the time that Unocal was
prosecuting its patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). In 2003, the FTC filed a
complaint against Unocal for antitrust violations. The FTC’s complaint seeks an injunction against
future '393 or '126 patent enforcement activity by Unocal against any person or entity with respect
to gasoline to be sold in California. The trial for the FTC’s antitrust charges against Unocal
began before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on October 19, 2004. Closing arguments are expected
to occur in May 2005, with an initial decision from the ALJ expected in mid to late June 2005. The
ALJ’s decision will likely be appealed to the full Commission.

In addition to the FTC proceedings, the '393 and '126 patents are being reexamined by the PTO. The
PTO has issued notices of rejection of all claims of each of these patents. These rejections are
subject to additional proceedings, including administrative appeal by Unocal, followed by an appeal
in federal district court or the court of appeals. Ultimate invalidation would preclude Unocal
from pursuing claims based on the '393 or '126 patents.

Unocal’s patent lawsuit against Valero is indefinitely stayed as a result of the PTO reexamination
proceedings. Notwithstanding the judgment against the other refiners in the previous litigation,
Valero believes that it has several strong defenses to Unocal’s lawsuit, including those arising
from Unocal’s misconduct, and Valero believes it will prevail in the lawsuit. However, due to the
inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is reasonably possible that Valero will not prevail in the
lawsuit, and an adverse result could have a material effect on Valero’s results of operations and
financial position. An estimate of the possible loss or range of loss from such an adverse result
cannot reasonably be made

.

MTBE Litigation

As of February 28, 2005, Valero was named as a defendant in 63 cases alleging liability related to
MTBE contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water providers, governmental
authorities and private water companies alleging that refiners and marketers of MTBE and gasoline
containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. Valero is named
in these suits together with many other refining industry companies. Valero is being sued
primarily as a refiner and marketer of MTBE and gasoline containing MTBE. Valero does not own or
operate gasoline station facilities in most of the geographic locations in which damage is alleged
to have occurred. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive
damages and attorneys’ fees. All but one of these cases have been removed to federal court by the
defendants and have been, or soon will be, consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Four of these cases have been selected by
the court as focus cases for discovery and pre-trial motions. Activity in the “non-focus” cases is
generally stayed pending certain determinations in the focus cases. Valero believes that it has
strong defenses to these claims and is vigorously defending the cases. Valero believes that an
adverse result in any one of these suits would not have a material effect on its results of
operations or financial position. However, Valero believes that an adverse result in all or a
substantial number of these cases could have a material effect on



Valero’s results of operations and financial position. An estimate of the possible losses or range
of losses from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these cases cannot reasonably be
made.

Environmental Proceedings

United States Environmental Protection Agency Region II, In the Matter of: Mobil Oil Corporation,
Notice of Violation CAA-02-2001-1305

(May 15, 2001) (Paulsboro Refinery). The EPA issued notices
of violation (NOVs) relating to Mobil Oil Corporation’s operation of the Paulsboro Refinery prior
to Valero’s ownership of the refinery. Valero purchased the refinery from Mobil in 1998. The NOVs
allege that Mobil performed certain actions on the refinery’s fluid catalytic cracking unit without
satisfying certain permitting and other requirements under the New Source Review provisions of the
Clean Air Act. Mobil tendered the NOVs to Valero for indemnification under the refinery purchase
agreement between Mobil and Valero. Valero has assumed the defense of these NOVs. The EPA has not
asserted a specific demand for administrative or civil penalties or equitable relief under the
NOVs, but potential penalties under the NOVs could exceed $100,000. Valero is seeking to settle
these matters in the settlement of the Section 114 enforcement action described above under the
caption “Environmental Matters.”

United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX

(June 3, 2004) (Benicia Refinery). The
EPA issued an NOV relating to various waste management permitting issues related to Valero’s
Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant. In June 2004, the EPA proposed a penalty of $208,180 for this
matter. The EPA has now offered to settle this matter for an amount less
than $100,000. Valero expects to settle this matter in late March 2005.

Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD)

(Benicia Refinery). Valero has
received 114
violation notices (VNs) since April 2002 from the BAAQMD for incidents at
Valero’s Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant. Sixty-six of the VNs relate to alleged excess
emissions from fugitive leaks, fire, process upset or instrument
malfunction. Fifteen VNs allege
visible emissions resulting from power failure, operational upset or instrument malfunction. Three
VNs allege public nuisances resulting from fire, power failure or
release. The remaining 30 VNs
allege recordkeeping discrepancies for late reporting or failure to meet a permit condition, or
odor associated with a process upset. In the first quarter of 2005, Valero settled 56 of these VNs
(originating primarily in 2002 and 2003) for an amount immaterial to Valero, but in excess of
$100,000. No penalties have been assessed for the remaining VNs. Valero is negotiating with the
BAAQMD to resolve all of these matters. Valero expects to settle the remaining VNs for an amount
immaterial to Valero, but in excess of $100,000.

City of Houston Bureau of Air Quality Control (HBAQC), et al.

(Houston Refinery). The HBAQC and
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued 39 VNs from September 2002 to January
2005 to the Houston Refinery for various alleged noncompliance issues. The HBAQC issued 36 VNs for
alleged incidents related to or resulting from excess emissions. The three VNs issued by the TCEQ
related to excess emissions, failure to monitor/report upset emissions, and waste management. No
penalties have been assessed for the VNs. Valero continues to negotiate with the agencies and
expects to settle all 39 VNs for an amount immaterial to Valero, but in excess of $100,000. Valero
is seeking to settle these matters within Valero’s settlement with the EPA of the Section 114
enforcement action described above under the caption “Environmental Matters.”



New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)

(Paulsboro Refinery). Valero has
received 29 NJDEP Administrative Orders and Notices of Civil Administrative Penalty Assessments
(Orders) from February 2002 through February 2005 for alleged incidents at Valero’s Paulsboro
Refinery. Fifteen of the Orders relate to excess emissions, for which the NJDEP has proposed
penalties totaling $189,250. Eight of the Orders relate to failure to repair fugitive leaks or
tank seals, for which penalties of $408,800 are proposed. Two Orders are for alleged Title V
permit deviations (proposed penalties of $36,000), two are for alleged failures to operate
according to approved plans or permit conditions (proposed penalties of $7,000), one is for failure
to make a required notification (proposed penalties of $6,000), and one is for exceeding the
refinery’s total annual benzene limit. Valero is negotiating a settlement with the NJDEP and
expects to settle all of the Orders for an amount immaterial to Valero, but in excess of $100,000.
Valero is seeking to settle most of these matters with the NJDEP together with Valero’s settlement with the
EPA of the Section 114 enforcement action described above under the caption “Environmental
Matters.” In addition to the foregoing matters, the NJDEP has
issued demands for stipulated penalties (totaling $100,000 in the
aggregate) to the refinery for two alleged failures of a stack test
required by an Administrative Consent Order entered in May 2000.
Valero believes that it has strong defenses to these demands and
intends to challenge them in an administrative hearing.

South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD)

(Wilmington Refinery). The SCAQMD issued
19 VNs to Valero’s Wilmington Refinery in 2003-2004 for alleged excess emissions and one permitting
discrepancy. No penalties have been assessed for the alleged violations. Valero is negotiating
with the SCAQMD to resolve these issues and expects to settle all of the VNs for an amount
immaterial to Valero, but possibly in excess of $100,000.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)

(Corpus Christi East Refinery). Valero received
three notices of enforcement (NOE) from the TCEQ relating to alleged emission events and
recordkeeping issues from August 2003 to April 2004 at Valero’s Corpus Christi East Refinery,
primarily relating to vacuum off-gas compressor outages. Valero is negotiating with the TCEQ to
resolve these matters, and expects to settle them for an amount immaterial to Valero, but in excess
of $100,000.

Other Litigation

Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or
proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or liquidity; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the
range of any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision and Valero
cannot provide assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have
an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2004.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following review of the results of operations and financial condition of Valero should be read
in conjunction with Items 1 & 2, “Business & Properties,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per-share
amounts assume dilution.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Form 10-K, including without limitation the discussion below under the heading “

Results of
Operations - Outlook

,” contains certain estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions and other
“forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and uncertainties. While
these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good
faith and reflect Valero’s current judgment regarding the direction of its business, actual results
will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections,
assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. These forward-looking statements
can generally be identified by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,”
“estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “may” and similar
expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:

Valero’s forward-looking statements are based on its beliefs and assumptions derived from
information available at the time the statements are made. Differences between actual results and
any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of
factors, including the following:



Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect Valero’s
future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be
accurate. Valero’s forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual
results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking
statements. Valero does not intend to update these statements unless it is required by the
securities laws to do so.

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Valero or persons acting
on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. Valero undertakes no
obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements
that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events.



OVERVIEW

Generally, Valero’s operations are affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance
turnarounds,

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products, and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the
effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of
refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance
turnarounds.

Valero’s profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined
products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” Since
approximately 50% of Valero’s total throughput represents sour crude oil feedstocks, Valero’s
profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude
oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil discount.” For the year 2004, both refined product
margins and sour crude oil discounts were the best ever experienced by Valero. The strength of
those positive industry fundamentals significantly enhanced Valero’s results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2004, resulting in earnings per share of $6.53. This represented a 156%
increase over the $2.55 per share earnings reported for 2003, as adjusted to reflect the effect of
a two-for-one stock split discussed below.

Valero’s operating results during 2004 benefited significantly from recent investments that
increased Valero’s capacity to process lower-cost feedstocks. In March 2004, Valero continued its
strategic growth through the acquisition of the Aruba Refinery and related marine, bunkering and
marketing operations. The Aruba Refinery, which processes heavy, sour crude oil, contributed
approximately $290 million to Valero’s operating income for 2004. In addition, the 45,000 BPD
coker unit at the Texas City Refinery, which began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003
and also processes heavier, lower-cost crude oil, generated nearly $200 million of operating income
in 2004. Furthermore, during 2004, Valero realized the benefits from a full year of operations of
the St. Charles Refinery that was acquired on July 1, 2003. The St. Charles Refinery generated
approximately $335 million of operating income in 2004.

The positive 2004 results from Valero’s operations, as well as certain investing and financing
activities during 2004, significantly improved Valero’s financial position and are expected to
favorably position Valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return, continued growth
and improved earnings stability. Valero’s debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) decreased
from approximately 40% at December 31, 2003 to 30.7% at the end of 2004. During 2004, Valero’s
debt-to-capitalization ratio was positively impacted by the generation of $3.0 billion of cash from
operating activities and the sale of 15.6 million shares of common stock which partially funded the
Aruba Acquisition.

As discussed further under “

Outlook

” below, Valero’s increasing ability to process heavier sour
crude oils is expected to enable Valero to further benefit from wide sour crude oil discounts that
Valero believes will occur. Valero believes that it is well-positioned to benefit from an expected
continuation of favorable refining industry fundamentals.

On July 15, 2004, Valero’s board of directors approved a two-for-one split of Valero’s common
stock, which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on October 7, 2004 to stockholders of
record on September 23, 2004. All share and per share data (except par value) in this Form 10-K
have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented.

General

Operating revenues increased 44% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December
31, 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput
volumes from refinery operations. The increases in operating income from $1.2 billion for 2003 to
$3.0 billion for 2004 and net income from $621.5 million for 2003 to $1.8 billion for 2004 were
attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valero’s refining segment as discussed below.

Refining

Operating income for Valero’s refining segment was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31,
2004, an increase of $1.9 billion from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in refining
segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45% increase in refining throughput margin per
barrel and an 18% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses.

Refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors:

The above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of:

•

lower margins on products such as asphalt, No. 6 fuel oil, sulfur and petroleum coke
due to an increase in the price of crude oil in 2004 compared to 2003,

•

an approximate $20 million reduction resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of
Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003,

•

a higher level of turnaround activity in 2004 compared to 2003, and

•

approximately $231 million of hedging losses in 2004 related to forward sales of
distillates and associated crude oil purchases.

Refining operating expenses were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in July
2003 and the Aruba Refinery in March 2004, higher energy costs (primarily related to an increase in
natural gas prices), increased maintenance expense, an increase in employee compensation and
benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increases in
insurance expense, injected catalyst,



professional fees and regulatory costs. Although total refining operating expenses increased 29%
from 2003 to 2004, this increase was 9% on a per-barrel basis. The lower percentage increase on a
per-barrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the St. Charles and Aruba
Acquisitions. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from the year ended
December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new
capital projects, the acquisitions of the St. Charles and Aruba Refineries and increased turnaround
and catalyst amortization.

Retail

Retail operating income was $175.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of
$36.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. Retail fuel margins in the United States
decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to
the consumer, and fuel sales declined in the United States due to fewer stores. Retail
depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on
the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations. In the Northeast,
operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a
significant increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense,
increased $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December
31, 2003. Employee compensation and benefits increased approximately $41 million from 2003 to
2004, including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of
approximately $21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective
years. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and
regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions.

Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valero’s equity interest in the earnings of Valero
L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, Valero’s ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased
from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with
certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that
date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. The minority
interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income
of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero consolidated such operations.

“Other income (expense), net” for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes an impairment charge of
$57.2 million to write off the carrying amount of Valero’s equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol
Partners, L.P., as further described in Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the effect of this impairment charge, other income
declined $6.0 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a $17.0 million gain recognized in 2003
related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the
Golden Eagle Business (described further in Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a $10 million increase in equity income in
2004 from the Javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices.

Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption
of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the
Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units) in August 2003.

Income tax expense increased $541.2 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175%
increase in income before income tax expense. Valero’s effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2004,



however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to the Aruba Acquisition,
the results of operations of which are substantially non-taxable in Aruba through December 31,
2010.

General

Operating revenues increased 31% from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December
31, 2003 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput
volumes from refinery operations. The increases in operating income from $470.9 million for 2002
to $1.2 billion for 2003 and net income from $91.5 million for 2002 to $621.5 million for 2003 were
attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valero’s refining segment as discussed below.

Refining

Operating income for Valero’s refining segment was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31,
2003, an increase of $744.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in
refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 28% increase in refining throughput
margin per barrel and a 15% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an
increase in operating expenses.

Refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following factors:

•

Gasoline and distillate margins improved significantly during 2003 compared to 2002 due
to stronger demand and lower inventory levels. Demand for distillates improved
significantly in 2003 due to colder winter weather in the Northeast and fuel switching
demand in early 2003 caused by high natural gas prices. Refined product inventories were
lower than the inventory levels that existed during most of 2002 due to the stronger demand
combined with lower refinery production rates resulting from a large number of maintenance
turnarounds in the refining industry in the first quarter of 2003 and the continuing impact
of the oil workers’ strike in Venezuela in early 2003, which also reduced production rates.
The high inventory levels in 2002 were caused by weaker economic conditions, an unusually
warm winter in the northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet fuel
demand.

•

Discounts on Valero’s sour crude oil feedstocks increased for the year ended December
31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due mainly to the resumption of
higher crude oil production rates by OPEC.

•

Valero’s throughput volumes for 2003 increased from 2002 due to incremental volumes from
the St. Charles Refinery commencing in July 2003 and increased refinery utilization rates
during 2003, as eight of Valero’s refineries were affected by turnaround activities during
2002. Also during 2002, production at several refineries was reduced at various times
during the year due to uneconomic operating conditions.

The above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the effects of:

•

a net benefit of approximately $76 million in 2002 resulting from the settlement of
petroleum products purchase agreements and related hedges,

•

a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of Valero’s LIFO inventories in
2002,

•

an approximate $62 million reduction resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of
Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, and

•

an increase in unplanned downtime during 2003 at certain of Valero’s refineries.

Refining operating expenses were 24% higher for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in July
2003, higher energy costs (primarily related to natural gas), an increase in employee compensation
and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increased
maintenance expense associated with unplanned downtime. Although total operating expenses
increased 24%, the increase in refining operating expenses on a per barrel basis was 8% from 2002
to 2003 due to an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above. Refining
depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% from the year ended



December 31, 2002 to the
year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the St.
Charles Refinery and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization.

Retail

Retail operating income was $211.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of
$83.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of higher retail fuel margins in
both the U.S. and Northeast retail systems and operational improvements. During 2003, Valero
continued to implement its U.S. retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in certain key
stores and disposing of certain underperforming or non-strategic stores. During 2003, Valero
reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores. These changes contributed to
improved operating income for the retail segment in 2003.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense,
increased $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December
31, 2002. Part of the increase was due to the recognition of increased variable and incentive
compensation expense of approximately $21 million in 2003 as a result of improved financial
performance in 2003 as compared to 2002. Also, in December 2003, a $25.8 million impairment charge
was recognized and reflected in corporate depreciation and amortization expense to write down the
carrying amount of Valero’s former headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs, as
described further in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The remainder of the
increase was attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits expenses, ad valorem taxes
and litigation costs.

Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valero’s equity interest in the earnings of Valero
L.P. after March 18, 2003, the date Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. and began using the
equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of
Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the
periods that Valero consolidated such operations.

The increase in “other income, net” from 2002 to 2003 was due mainly to a gain of $17.0 million
related to the sale of notes receivable from Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro) in
connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in 2002. This gain was offset by a $7.1
million decrease in equity income from joint ventures and $4.2 million of expense resulting from
the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation.

Net interest and debt expense decreased $24.4 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a decrease
in debt levels from $5 billion as of December 31, 2002 to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2003 and
an increase in capitalized interest attributable to a larger capital investment program.

Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased $13.2 million from the year
ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32%
TOPrS in June 2003 and the settlement of the PEPS Units in August 2003.

Income tax expense increased from $58.2 million in 2002 to $365.1 million in 2003 due to the
significant increase in pre-tax income.



OUTLOOK

Sour crude oil discounts in January and February 2005 have improved significantly from early 2004
levels and are expected to remain strong throughout 2005. Two primary factors support an
expectation of continuing wide sour crude oil discounts. First, a projected increase in the global
demand for crude oil in 2005 is expected to
result in higher production of medium and heavy sour crude oils. However, global conversion
capacity to process this incremental sour crude oil is limited. Lack of conversion capacity will
result in higher yields of residual fuel by-product for which demand is declining due to tighter
environmental standards. Sour crude oil discounts will stay wide to justify the yield of low-value
resid in low-conversion refineries. Refineries with conversion capacity to upgrade the resid will
benefit. Secondly, as refiners seek to meet the requirements of the global movement to cleaner
fuels, the demand for sweet crude oils continues to grow due to their higher yield of clean
products, leading to increased prices for sweeter crude oils.

In addition to the very favorable outlook for sour crude oil discounts, the outlook for refined
product margins appears favorable as a result of continued strong demand for both gasoline and
diesel. The favorable factors that were in place in 2004 are expected to continue in 2005 as
worldwide demand continues to exceed production capacity. In addition, refined product margins
should benefit from a further tightening of fuel specifications worldwide, making it more difficult
for foreign refiners to meet the U.S. specifications on imports.

Operationally, Valero expects to benefit during 2005 from the full-year effect of the Aruba
Refinery that was acquired in March 2004 and also expects to benefit from strategic projects that
were completed during 2004 and will be completed during 2005, particularly those projects that
further Valero’s strategy of processing heavier and more sour feedstocks. For 2005, throughput
volume is expected to increase approximately 100,000 BPD compared to 2004.

As a result of these factors, Valero believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on the expected
positive industry fundamentals and the resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and
sour crude oil discounts during 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3.0 billion
compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.2 billion. The
increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due to the significant
increase in income in 2004 as described above under “

Results of Operations,

” partially offset by a
$226.6 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years. As
reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
for the year ended December 31, 2004, working capital requirements decreased by approximately $203
million, largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities, while 2003
benefited primarily from a $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under Valero’s
accounts receivable sales program. Other significant working capital changes for 2004, which
substantially offset each other, included increases in receivables, accounts payable, inventories
and taxes other than income taxes. All of these changes were attributable to increases in both
throughput volumes and commodity prices from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. Valero’s cash
balance increased by $494.4 million during 2004.



In addition to the $3.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash
from various other sources during 2004, including proceeds of approximately $406 million from the
sale of common stock, approximately $135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock
related to Valero’s benefit plans, approximately $109 million of proceeds from dispositions of
property, plant and equipment, and approximately $64 million of net borrowings (borrowings net of
debt repayments). Valero used these proceeds to:

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1.8 billion
compared to $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.5 billion. The
increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the
significant increase in income in 2003 as described above under “

Results of Operations

” and changes
in cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further reflected in Note
17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary cause of the change in working
capital between the years related to changes in the amount of receivables sold under Valero’s
accounts receivable sales program. During 2003, the amount of receivables sold under the program
increased by $350 million, while during 2002, working capital was increased by a $123 million
decrease in the amount of receivables sold. For the year ended December 31, 2003, in addition to
the $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold, changes in working capital included a
$415.8 million increase in accounts payable, which more than offset a $270.0 million increase in
inventories. Inventories increased due to higher volumes of feedstock and refined product
inventories on hand at December 31, 2003 attributable primarily to (i) lower than normal feedstock
levels at December 31, 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers’ strike in Venezuela and
(ii) increased refinery utilization rates during 2003.

In addition to the $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash
from various other sources during 2003, including proceeds of approximately $300 million from the
issuance of senior notes in June, $250.3 million from the issuance of common stock in March, $379.9
million from the contribution and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P., $89.6 million from the
sale of Tesoro notes held by Valero, and $94.2 million from the disposition of certain parts of its
home heating oil business and other property, plant and equipment. Valero used these proceeds to:



The remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under Valero’s committed and
uncommitted bank credit facilities.

Aruba Acquisition

On March 5, 2004, Valero completed the purchase of El Paso Corporation’s Aruba Refinery and related
marine, bunkering and marketing operations. Consideration for the purchase consisted of $200
million in existing cash, approximately $27 million in borrowings under Valero’s existing bank
credit facilities and approximately $406 million in net proceeds from the sale of 15.6 million
shares of Valero common stock. In addition, upon termination on May 4, 2004 of an agreement in
existence with a third-party marketing firm on the date of acquisition, Valero paid $67.8 million
related to certain refined product inventories owned by the
third-party marketing firm.

Capital Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2004, Valero expended approximately $1.6 billion for capital
investments of which $1.3 billion related to capital expenditures (including approximately $523
million for environmental projects and approximately
$360 million for strategic projects) and $304.2 million related to deferred turnaround and catalyst
costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004 included approximately $184 million to fund construction of
gasoline desulfurization units at the Paulsboro, St. Charles, Quebec, Houston, McKee and Corpus
Christi West Refineries in response to Tier II regulations. In addition to the $1.6 billion of
capital investments discussed above, $567.1 million was expended for the purchase of various leased
properties, which were previously subject to structured lease arrangements (see Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $35.9 million was
invested in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $53.4 million of payments were made related
to the contingent earn-out agreements discussed below and other contingencies related to
acquisitions, and $541.3 million of cash was expended on the Aruba Acquisition.

In connection with Valero’s acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles
Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven
years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of
those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Any payments due under these earn-out arrangements
are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2004, Valero made an earn-out payment of
$35.0 million related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc. In January 2005, Valero made an
earn-out payment of $50.0 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery. Based on
estimated margin levels through April 2005, an earn-out payment related to the Basis Petroleum
Acquisition of $35 million would be due in May 2005.

For 2005, Valero expects to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments, including
approximately $1.7 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $900 million of which is for
environmental projects) and approximately $300 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs.
The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent
earn-out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. Valero continuously evaluates its
capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant.

In connection with Valero L.P.’s proposed merger of Kaneb Services LLC and Kaneb Pipe Line
Partners, L.P., Valero expects to contribute approximately $28 million to Valero L.P. to maintain
Valero’s 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P.

Long-Term Debt

Payments for long-term debt are at stated values.

On March 22, 2004, Valero issued $200 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due April 1, 2009 and $200
million of 4.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2014 under its prior shelf registration statement. The net
proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit
facilities.

On March 29, 2004, Valero borrowed $200 million under a five-year term loan with a maturity date of
March 31, 2009 and bearing interest based on Valero’s debt rating. Principal payments were
scheduled to begin March 2007 with a $50.0 million principal payment due at that time and
semi-annual payments of $37.5 million due thereafter until maturity. The net proceeds from this
borrowing were used to repay borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities. In
December 2004, Valero repaid the entire outstanding balance of the term loan.

None of Valero’s agreements have rating agency triggers that would automatically require Valero to
post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of Valero’s senior
unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of Valero’s bank credit facilities and other
arrangements would increase.

Operating Lease Obligations

Valero’s operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment,
retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities
and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production and sale of refinery feedstocks and
refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be
received by Valero under subleases.

Structured Lease Arrangements

During the first quarter of 2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties
under each of the four structured lease arrangements that existed as of December 31, 2003. Valero
purchased the leased properties for $567.1 million, using borrowings under its existing bank credit
facilities. Subsequent to this purchase, Valero issued $400 million of Senior Notes and borrowed
$200 million under a bank term loan, which are described above under “

Long-Term Debt,

” to refinance
these borrowings under its existing bank credit facilities and to take advantage of favorable
treasury rates.

Purchase Obligations

A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services
that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii)
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction.
Valero has various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements
(such as hydrogen supply



arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and
various throughput and terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these contracts to ensure an
adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its refineries. Substantially all
of Valero’s purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices.
Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others
are based on Valero’s usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table
above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum
quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market
conditions. As of December 31, 2004, Valero’s short-term and long-term purchase obligations
increased by approximately $8.4 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2003. The
increase is almost entirely attributable to an increase in obligations under crude oil supply
contracts resulting mainly from significantly higher crude oil prices as of December 31, 2004 and
new contracts in 2004, including contracts for feedstock to supply the Aruba Refinery which was
acquired in March
2004. Valero has not made in the past, nor does it expect to make in the future, payments for
feedstock or services that it has not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of
then prevailing market conditions.

Other Long-term Liabilities

Valero’s “other long-term liabilities” are described  in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2004. However,
certain expected payments related to Valero’s anticipated pension contribution in 2005 and its other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2004, Valero had $218.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under
uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $8.2 million of letters of credit outstanding
under its Canadian committed revolving credit facility and $278.9 million of letters of credit
outstanding under its 3-year and 5-year committed revolving credit facilities.

Under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities’ definitions, Valero’s debt-to-capitalization ratio
(net of cash) was 30.7% as of December 31, 2004 compared to 40.3% as of December 31, 2003.

Valero’s refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining
industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of
customers may impact Valero’s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in
that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
However, Valero believes that its portfolio of accounts



receivable is sufficiently diversified to
the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, Valero has not had any
significant problems collecting its accounts receivable.

On August 25, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a new shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 filed by Valero to register $3.5 billion of securities for
potential future issuance.

Valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations, and to the extent necessary, from the
public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund its ongoing operating requirements.
Valero expects that, to the extent necessary, it can raise additional funds from time to time
through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability
of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms acceptable to
Valero.

Equity

On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 15.6 million shares of its common stock,
which included 2.0 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter,
at a price of $26.63 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriter’s discount, commissions
and other issuance costs, of $405.8 million. These shares were issued under Valero’s prior shelf
registration statement to partially fund the Aruba Acquisition.

Valero purchases shares of its common stock in open market transactions to meet its obligations
under employee benefit plans. Valero also purchases shares of its common stock from its employees
and non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of
restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During 2004, Valero purchased 9.7
million shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of $317.4 million. Through
February 2005, Valero has purchased an additional 1.4 million common shares under these programs at
a cost of $77.6 million. No shares were purchased during 2004 or through February 2005 under
Valero’s $400 million stock repurchase program that was publicly announced on December 3, 2001.

Pension Plan Funded Status

During 2004, Valero contributed approximately $73 million to its qualified pension plans. Based on
a 5.75% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the
assets in Valero’s qualified pension plans were equal to approximately 73% of the projected benefit
obligation under those plans as of the end of 2004. However, the qualified pension plans were more
than 90% funded based on their “current liability,” which is a funding measure defined under
applicable pension regulations.

Although Valero has no minimum required contributions to its qualified pension plans during 2005
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Valero expects to contribute approximately $60
million to its qualified pension plans during 2005.

Environmental Matters

Valero is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations,
including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management,
pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates.
Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new
environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future
expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any
major upgrades in any of Valero’s refineries could require material additional expenditures to
comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding Valero’s
environmental matters, including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental
regulations, see “Environmental Matters” in Items 1 & 2, “Business & Properties” and Note 24 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

As of December 31, 2004, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with three third-party
financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $600 million of eligible trade and credit
card receivables, which matures in October 2005. Valero uses this program as a source of working
capital funding. Under this program, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero sells an undivided
percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party
financial institutions. Valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and
pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2004,
the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions was $600 million.
Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes
additional discussion of the activity related to this program.

Termination of this program would require Valero to obtain alternate working capital funding, which
would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on
Valero’s consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2004, the termination of this
program would not have had a material effect on Valero’s liquidity and would not have affected
Valero’s ability to comply with restrictive covenants in its credit facilities. Valero is not
aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or
material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. Valero’s board of
directors has approved an extension of this program, which is subject to finalization of the terms
of the agreements with the third-party financial institutions.

Guarantees

In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in May 2002, Valero guaranteed certain
lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which totaled approximately $34
million as of December 31, 2004. This lease expires in 2010. During the year ended December 31,
2004, Valero was not required to, and did not, make any payments under this guarantee.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial
accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for Valero’s financial
statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is
not expected to have, a material effect on Valero’s consolidated financial statements, except as
discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “

FASB Statement No. 123
(revised 2004)

.”

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about Valero’s
critical accounting policies, including separate identification of those involving critical
accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which summarizes Valero’s significant accounting policies.



Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates

The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level
of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on Valero’s consolidated financial
position and results of operations. Valero believes that all of its estimates are reasonable.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An
impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value.

In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related
to the asset which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the
asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the
asset’s existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain
estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions,
projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could
significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the
significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair
value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future,
thus affecting Valero’s earnings. Valero’s impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that
are consistent with Valero’s business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other
assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the
significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Valero recognized an impairment
charge of $57.2 million in 2004 related to its equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners,
L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and an impairment charge
of $25.8 million in 2003 related to Valero’s former headquarters buildings as discussed in Note 6
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valero did not recognize an impairment charge
during the year ended December 31, 2002.

Environmental Liabilities

Valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities
relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution
prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes
to required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and
operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.

Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future
costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well
as Valero’s own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult
to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the
timing of such remediation, and the determination of Valero’s obligation in proportion to other
parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of
new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their
interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and
potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for
changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes.



The balance of and changes in Valero’s accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is included in Note 24 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its
environmental exposures.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed
from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount
rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases and health care cost trend
rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside Valero’s control.
For example, the discount rate assumption is based on Moody’s published Aa corporate bond rate as
of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return
calculated for Valero by an outside consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through
2001 with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, representative of the asset mix in
Valero’s qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts
reported in Valero’s consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the
assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in
the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would
have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and net
periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2005 (in millions):

Other Critical Accounting Policies

The following accounting policies are less sensitive to management estimates but are presented to
enable a more complete understanding and comparability of Valero’s more significant accounting
policies.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased
for processing and refined products are determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of
inventory pricing. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of
materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted-average
cost method. Valero utilizes the dollar-value LIFO method and uses average purchase prices during
the year to value any increments to its LIFO inventory.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Valero records depreciation expense on its property, plant and equipment primarily using the
composite method of depreciation. Under the composite method of depreciation, the costs of minor
property units, net of salvage value, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated
depreciation while gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in
income. Although accounting for property, plant



and equipment requires various judgments and
estimates, including a determination of remaining useful lives, salvage values and the significance
of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and losses, changes in such estimates for
any particular asset are not expected to significantly affect Valero’s results of operations or
financial condition due to Valero’s use of the composite method of depreciation.

Refinery Turnaround Costs

Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance
activities at Valero’s refineries, are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs. The frequency
of refinery turnarounds varies with each refinery operating unit. As of December 31, 2004, Valero
had $320.4 million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance
sheet.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, Valero must assess the
likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To
the extent Valero believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established.
Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against
deferred income tax assets. Valero had a valuation allowance recorded as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax
assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax
credit carryforwards, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on Valero’s estimates
of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which
deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from the estimates or
Valero adjusts the estimates in future periods, Valero may need to revise the valuation allowance.
However, significant changes in such valuation allowances have not had in the past, and are not
expected to have in the future, a material effect on Valero’s financial condition or results of
operations. The net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $526.7
million and $600.1 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $83.3 million and $82.6
million, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost. An entity is required
to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate
of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the
liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including,
among other things, projected cash flows, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, and an assessment of
market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement
obligation. These estimates and assumptions are very subjective. However, Valero believes it has
adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations and that changes in estimates in future
periods would not have a significant effect on Valero’s financial condition or results of
operations. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the
effect of Valero’s adoption of Statement No. 143.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product
prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. In
order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments
to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its
unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). Valero also uses
derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as
forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash
flow hedges). In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to
price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted
feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases that do not receive
hedge accounting treatment. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which
changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, Valero uses
derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical
analysis of market conditions. See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of
derivative transactions.

The types of instruments used in Valero’s hedging and trading activities described above include
swaps, futures and options. Valero’s positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored
and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valero’s stated risk
management policy which has been approved by Valero’s board of directors.

The following tables provide information about Valero’s derivative commodity instruments as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive
prices as described below), including:

•

fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments,

•

cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined
product sales and natural gas purchases,

•

economic hedges held to:

•

manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and

•

manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined
product sales and natural gas purchases, and

•

trading activities held or issued for trading purposes.

Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in
billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted-average pay and receive prices
represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British
thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are
used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. The gain (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair
value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional
contract volumes. For futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair
value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount
over the fair value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the
weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the
weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The
weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike
price.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Valero’s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to its long-term debt
obligations. Valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a
combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, Valero utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain
fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for
as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest
expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded
amount of the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly.

The following table provides information about Valero’s long-term debt and interest rate derivative
instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For
long-term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected
maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and
weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are
used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted-average
floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

On March 25, 2004, Valero entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with a total
notional amount of $200 million. These interest rate swap contracts currently have an estimated
pay rate of 3.6% and hedge $200 million of debt with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

Valero enters into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage its exposure to
exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its Canadian operations. Changes in the fair
value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income
effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to
hedge. During May 2002, Valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its Canadian operations that Valero
intended to redeem in the future. Under these contracts, Valero sold $400 million of Canadian
dollars and bought $253.4 million of U.S. dollars.

In February 2004, Valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its Canadian
operations. As a result, Valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency
exchange contracts for a net cash payment by Valero of approximately $34 million, with an
immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these
contracts.

As of December 31, 2004, Valero had other commitments to purchase $5.0 million of U.S. dollars.
Valero’s market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 6, 2005.

As of December 31, 2004, Valero had also entered into a foreign currency exchange contract relating
to the purchase of commercial paper, which requires Valero to sell $20.0 million of U.S. dollars in
May 2005. The effect on this contract of a hypothetical 10% change in the year-end exchange rate
would be approximately $2 million.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Valero Energy
Corporation (Valero) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over
financial reporting” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) for
Valero. Valero’s management evaluated the effectiveness of Valero’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In its evaluation, Valero’s management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Management believes that as of December 31, 2004, Valero’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria. Valero’s independent registered public accounting
firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of Valero’s internal control over
financial reporting, which begins on page 57 of this report on Form 10-K.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Valero Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for the year then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the effectiveness of Valero
Energy Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March
11, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective
operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting for the year ended December 31, 2004

,

that Valero
Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the consolidated balance sheet
of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for the year then
ended, and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Valero Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive
income for each of the two years in the period then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2003, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the
two years in the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

As used in this report, the term Valero may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its
consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. Valero, an independent refining and
marketing company, owns and operates 15 refineries (six in Texas, two each in California and
Louisiana, and one each in Colorado, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Aruba and Quebec, Canada) with a
combined total throughput capacity as of December 31, 2004 of approximately 2.5 million barrels per
day. Valero markets refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a
network of more than 4,700 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States and eastern
Canada under various brand names including primarily Valero

, Diamond
Shamrock

®

, Shamrock

®

,

Ultramar

®

and Beacon

®

.
Valero’s operations are affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance
turnarounds;

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving
season and heating oil during the winter season; and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the
effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of
refined products, industry supply capacity and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds.

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which
Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in 50% or less owned entities are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting (see Note 9 for a discussion of the reporting change in 2003 for Valero’s investment
in Valero L.P., a related party which was consolidated by Valero until March 2003).

Share and per share data (except par value) presented for all periods reflect the effect of a
two-for-one stock split, which was effected in the form of a common stock dividend distributed on
October 7, 2004, as discussed in Note 15 under “

Common Stock Split

.”

The term UDS Acquisition refers to the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation (UDS) into
Valero effective December 31, 2001.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on
currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates.

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments

Valero’s temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments which generally
have a maturity of three months or less when acquired. Cash and temporary cash investments exclude
cash that is not available to Valero due to restrictions related to its use. Such amounts are
segregated in the consolidated balance sheets in “restricted cash” (see Note 3).



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased
for processing and refined products are determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
Valero uses the dollar-value LIFO method with any increments valued based on average purchase
prices during the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of
materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined principally under the
weighted-average cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Additions to property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and certain costs
allocable to construction and property purchases, are recorded at cost.

The costs of minor property units (or components of property units), net of salvage value, retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation under the composite method of
depreciation. Gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are
recorded in income and are reported in “depreciation and amortization expense” in the consolidated
statements of income.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related facilities primarily using the composite method of
depreciation. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using
the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the
related asset.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets
acquired less liabilities assumed. Intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance
(excluding financial assets). Goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be
impaired. Valero uses October 1 of each year as its annual valuation date for the impairment test.

Deferred Charges and Other Assets

“Deferred charges and other assets, net” include the following:

•

refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance activities at Valero’s refineries and which are deferred when incurred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the
next turnaround occurs;

•

fixed-bed catalyst costs, which represent the cost of catalyst that is changed out at
periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed
function and which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the specific catalyst;

•

investments in certain 50% or less owned entities which are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting; and

•

other noncurrent assets such as notes receivable, long-term investments, debt issuance
costs and various other costs.

Valero evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that it may
not be able to recover the carrying amount of its investments or the investee is unable to sustain
an earnings capacity that



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a
temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the
estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. After considering the
impairment of Valero’s equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. discussed in Note
10, Valero believes that the carrying amounts of its equity method investments as of December 31,
2004 are recoverable.

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, investments in 50%
or less owned entities, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A long-lived
asset is not recoverable if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If
an asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on
discounted estimated net cash flows. Valero believes that the carrying amounts of its long-lived
assets as of December 31, 2004, are recoverable.

Taxes Other than Income Taxes

“Taxes other than income taxes” includes primarily liabilities for ad valorem taxes, excise taxes
and payroll taxes.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Staff Position No. FAS
109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” which
clarifies that the deduction for qualified production activities included in the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the 2004 Act) should be:

•

accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with Statement No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” and

•

considered by an enterprise in (a) measuring deferred taxes when graduated tax rates are
a significant factor and (b) assessing whether a valuation allowance is necessary.

The guidance of Staff Position No. FAS 109-1 was effective upon issuance. There was no impact to
Valero’s 2004 consolidated financial statements as a result of adoption of Staff Position No. FAS
109-1.

Also in December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,”
which allows an enterprise time beyond the end of the financial reporting period covering the date
of enactment to evaluate the effect of the 2004 Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
foreign earnings for purposes of applying Statement No. 109. There was no impact to Valero’s 2004
consolidated financial statements as a result of adoption of Staff Position No. FAS 109-2. Valero
currently has no plans to repatriate funds under the provisions of the 2004 Act.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for obligations
associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The
provisions of this statement apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal
operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.

On January 1, 2003, Valero recognized an asset retirement obligation of $30.0 million, which is
included in “other long-term liabilities,” and an increase to net property, plant and equipment of
$25.8 million. The implementation of Statement No. 143 resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.2 million,
which was included in the consolidated statements of income in “other income (expense), net” versus
presentation as a cumulative effect of an accounting change due to immateriality. This asset
retirement obligation relates to the removal of underground storage tanks from Valero’s retail
sites. Valero also determined at that time that an asset retirement obligation exists related to
its refinery assets. However, the fair value of the asset retirement obligation associated with
these refinery assets cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement dates are indeterminate;
therefore, no obligation was recorded for these refinery assets. In 2004, Valero voluntarily
decided to decommission and remediate certain waste water ponds at one of its refineries, thereby
requiring the closure of the ponds in accordance with applicable state law. At the time of this
decision, an asset retirement obligation of $15.5 million was recorded in “other long-term
liabilities.” For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the changes in Valero’s asset
retirement obligations were as follows (in millions):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of Valero’s Canadian and Aruba operations are the Canadian dollar and the
Aruban florin, respectively. The translation into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet
accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense
accounts using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year. Adjustments resulting from
this translation are reported in “accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenues for products sold by both the refining and retail segments are recorded upon delivery of
the products to their customers, which is the point at which title to the products is transferred,
and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. Revenues for
services are recorded when the services have been provided.

Revenues include the sales portion of certain buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases
and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality or grade
requirements. In some cases, to obtain crude oil of a specific grade and quantity for certain of
Valero’s refineries, Valero must agree to sell crude oil of a different grade and quantity to its
supplier at another location. Valero generally does not have the specific crude oil to satisfy its
supplier’s needs and therefore must purchase that crude oil from a third party. Valero sells the
crude oil acquired from the third party to its crude oil supplier and recognizes revenue on the
sale and cost of sales at that time. Currently, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is
addressing the accounting for linked purchase and sale arrangements in EITF Issue No. 04-13,
“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.” Valero will monitor
the progress of EITF Issue No. 04-13 to ensure that Valero’s accounting for its linked purchases
and sales complies with the EITF’s final consensus opinion. If the final consensus opinion were to
require presentation of such linked purchases and sales on a net basis, operating revenues would be
reduced and cost of sales would be reduced by an equal amount in Valero’s consolidated statement of
income.

Valero enters into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with its
customers by accessing refined products in markets where it does not operate its own refinery.
These refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no
revenues are recorded on these transactions.

Product Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in “cost of sales” in the
consolidated statements of income.

Environmental Matters

Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time
period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as Valero’s
own internal environmental policies. The environmental liabilities have not been reduced by
possible recoveries from third parties of amounts payable by Valero.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Derivative Instruments

All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
measured at their fair value. When Valero enters into a derivative instrument, it is designated as
a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge or a trading instrument. For Valero’s
economic hedging relationships (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for
derivative instruments entered into by Valero for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is
recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized
currently in income. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a
fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the
hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the
gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is reported
as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is recorded in income in the same period or
periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The remaining ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized currently
in income. Gains and losses on trading instruments are reflected on a net basis in the
consolidated statements of income.

Financial Instruments

Valero’s financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, restricted cash,
receivables, payables, debt, interest rate swaps, commodity contracts and foreign currency
contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying
amounts as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, except for certain long-term debt as
discussed in Note 12. The fair value of Valero’s debt, interest rate swaps, commodity contracts
and foreign currency contracts was estimated based on year-end quoted market prices.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Earnings per common share -
assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution of Valero’s outstanding stock options and
performance awards granted to employees in connection with Valero’s stock compensation plans, as
well as the 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock discussed in Note 15 and the PEPS Units prior
to the settlement of the related purchase contract obligations as discussed in Note 14.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders’
equity that, under United States generally accepted accounting principles, are excluded from net
income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments and
gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments.

Stock-Based Compensation

Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting set forth in APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations as currently permitted by Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 was $16.03, $15.29 and $9.55 per stock option, respectively. The fair value of each
stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions:

Because Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method,
compensation cost is not recognized in the consolidated statements of income for Valero’s fixed
stock option plans as all options granted have an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for Valero’s fixed stock
option plans been determined based on the grant-date fair value of awards consistent with the
alternative method set forth in Statement No. 123, Valero’s net income applicable to common stock,
net income and earnings per common share, both with and without dilution, for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the
following table (in millions, except per share amounts):



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

For stock-based compensation awards other than fixed stock option awards, the after-tax
compensation cost reflected in net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$23.5 million, $8.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively.

See “

New Accounting Pronouncements

” below for a discussion of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised
2004), which requires changes to the accounting for stock-based compensation beginning in 2005.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” which
provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) for sponsors of postretirement health care plans. Staff
Position No. FAS 106-2 is effective for interim or annual financial statements for periods
beginning after June 15, 2004, and supersedes the guidance of Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 on the
same subject, which allowed employers to defer accounting for the effects of the Act, including the
effect of a federal subsidy provided for in the Act. For sponsors of postretirement health care
plans that provide prescription drug benefits, Staff Position No. FAS 106-2 requires the sponsor to
determine whether those benefits are actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug
benefit, and, if so, to remeasure the postretirement benefit obligation, and the effect of such
remeasurement on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost, on a retroactive or prospective
basis at the election of the sponsor. Valero concluded that the enactment of the Act did not
constitute a significant event under Statement No. 106, and therefore, in lieu of remeasuring plan
obligations at the beginning of the third quarter, Valero incorporated the effects of the Act into
the regular measurement of plan obligations as of December 31, 2004. See Note 22 for a further
discussion of the effect of the Act on Valero.

New Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Statement No. 151

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, “Inventory Costs,” which clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material and requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges. Statement No. 151
also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. Statement No. 151 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005, and is not expected to affect Valero’s financial position or results
of operations.

FASB Statement No. 153

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,” which
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. Statement No. 153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets, which
was previously provided by APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” and
replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. Statement No.
153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement No. 153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2005. The adoption of Statement No. 153 is not expected to affect Valero’s financial position or
results of operations.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004)

In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 123, which will become effective for
Valero on July 1, 2005. The revised statement eliminates the alternative to use APB Opinion No.
25’s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement No. 123 as originally
issued and requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. Under the revised
Statement No. 123, Valero will transition to the fair-value-based method using a modified
prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized commencing
on the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not
yet been rendered.

As permitted by Statement No. 123, Valero currently accounts for share-based payments to employees
using Opinion No. 25’s intrinsic value method, and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation
cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of the revised Statement No. 123’s fair
value method will reduce Valero’s results of operations, but it will not impact Valero’s overall
financial position. The magnitude of the impact of adoption of the revised Statement No. 123
cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted
in the future. However, had Valero adopted the revised Statement No. 123 in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No. 123 as described in the
disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in “

Stock-Based Compensation

” above.

The revised Statement No. 123 also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current literature. This requirement will reduce cash flows from operating
activities and increase cash flows from financing activities in periods after adoption. While
Valero cannot estimate the magnitude of such amounts in the future because they depend on, among
other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized
in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $53.5 million, $15.2 million and $18.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts in the 2003 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation.

2. ACQUISITIONS

Aruba Acquisition

On March 5, 2004, Valero completed the purchase of El Paso Corporation’s refinery located on the
island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea (Aruba Refinery), and related marine, bunkering and marketing
operations (collectively, Aruba Acquisition). The purchase price for the Aruba Acquisition was
$465 million plus approximately $168 million for working capital. The working capital amount
excludes amounts related to certain refined product inventories owned by a third-party marketing
firm under an agreement in existence on the date of acquisition, pursuant to which Valero paid
$67.8 million upon termination of the agreement on May 4, 2004. The Aruba Acquisition, the purpose
of which was to strengthen Valero’s geographic and product diversification, ensure a more secure
supply of intermediate feedstocks and blendstocks to certain of its other refineries, and increase
Valero’s potential ability to take advantage of positive heavy sour crude oil fundamentals, was
funded with $200 million in existing cash, approximately $27 million in borrowings under Valero’s
bank credit facilities and approximately $406 million in net proceeds from the sale of 15.6 million



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

shares of Valero common stock through a public offering discussed in Note 15 under “

Common Stock
Offerings.

” The amount paid to the third-party marketing firm described above was funded through
borrowings under Valero’s bank credit facilities. The results of the Aruba Refinery’s operations
are non-taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010.

The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated among the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed at the date of acquisition, based on their fair values as determined by an independent
appraisal and other evaluations. The final allocation of the purchase price is pending the
resolution of certain employee benefit plan matters. As of December 31, 2004, the purchase price
allocation was as follows (in millions):

St. Charles Acquisition

On July 1, 2003, Valero completed the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery (St. Charles
Acquisition) from Orion Refining Corporation (Orion). Total consideration for the purchase,
including various transaction costs incurred and the release of certain escrowed amounts discussed
below, was $529.0 million and included the issuance of 10 million shares of mandatory convertible
preferred stock with a fair value of $22 per share. The purchase agreement required 844,000 shares
of the mandatory convertible preferred stock to be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of
certain conditions. The purchase agreement also provided for the assumption of certain
environmental and regulatory obligations as well as for potential earn-out payments up to an
aggregate of $175 million as discussed in Note 23 under

“Contingent Earn-Out Agreements.”

As of
December 31, 2003, the escrowed shares had been converted to cash, which was held in escrow and
reflected in “restricted cash” in the consolidated balance sheet. Through December 31, 2004,
Valero paid a total of $17.3 million of the escrowed cash as prescribed by the purchase
agreement.

The total potential earn-out payments of $175 million discussed above were recognized in “property,
plant and equipment” (with $50 million recorded as a current liability in “accrued expenses” and
$125 million recorded in “other long-term liabilities”) as part of the purchase price allocation
since the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the cost of the
acquisition by an amount greater than the potential earn-out amount. During the second quarter of
2004, an independent appraisal was completed and the resulting final purchase price allocation for
the St. Charles Acquisition is summarized below (in millions). The amounts reflected include the
accrual of the potential earn-out payments.

Valero maintains an accounts receivable sales facility with three third-party financial
institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $600 million of eligible trade and credit card
receivables, which matures in October 2005. Under this program, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Valero sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without
recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Valero remains responsible for servicing the
transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program.
Under the facility, Valero retains the residual interest in the designated pool of receivables.
This retained interest, which is included in “receivables, net” in the consolidated balance sheets,
is recorded at fair value. Due to (i) a short average collection cycle for such receivables, (ii)
Valero’s collection experience history, and (iii) the composition of the designated pool of trade
and credit card accounts receivable that are part of this program, the fair value of Valero’s
retained interest approximates the total amount of the designated pool of accounts receivable
reduced by the amount of accounts receivable sold to the third-party financial institutions under
the program.

The
costs incurred by Valero related to this facility, as well as a
similar facility assumed in the UDS Acquisition that was terminated in October 2002, which were included in “other income
(expense), net” in the consolidated statements of income, were $11.7 million, $6.2 million and $6.8
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Proceeds from
collections under these revolving accounts receivable sales facilities of $17.6 billion, $12.4
billion and $8.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
reinvested in the programs by the third-party financial institutions.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

However, the third-party
financial institutions’ interests in Valero’s accounts receivable were never in excess of the sales
facility limits at any time under these programs. No accounts receivable included in these
programs were written off during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of Valero’s accounts
receivable comprised the designated pools of trade and credit card accounts receivable included in
the program. Of these amounts, $600 million was sold to the third-party financial institutions and
the remaining amount was retained by Valero.

liquidations of LIFO inventories during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. A reduction of
inventory volumes during 2002 resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower
costs which prevailed in prior years. The liquidation decreased cost of sales by approximately $39
million in 2002.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the replacement cost of LIFO inventories exceeded their LIFO
carrying amounts by approximately $1.2 billion and $666 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Valero had crude oil processing facilities, pipeline and terminal
facilities, and certain buildings and other equipment under capital leases totaling $8.0 million
and $6.1 million, respectively. Accumulated amortization on assets under capital leases was $0.8
million and $0.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

On February 28, 2003, Valero exercised its option under certain capital leases with El Paso
Corporation to purchase the Corpus Christi East Refinery and related refined product logistics
business, which had been operated by Valero since June 1, 2001. In connection with the exercise of
the purchase option, the original purchase price for the assets was reduced by approximately $5
million to $289.3 million and the lease payment of approximately $5 million due in the first
quarter of 2003 was avoided. No gain or loss was recorded on this transaction.

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $418.0 million,
$340.7 million and $316.3 million, respectively. During 2004, net gains of $12.7 million were
recorded on the disposition of various facilities, primarily resulting from a $15.1 million gain on
the sale in December 2004 of a pipeline grid system at Mont Belvieu and the tankage and idle MTBE
plant at Morgan’s Point for $27 million. During 2003, net gains of $14.6 million were recorded on
the disposition of various facilities, primarily resulting from the sale of certain retail stores
and Valero’s home heating oil business in the northeastern United States and southern Ontario in
Canada.

Valero’s prior headquarters facility consisted of two buildings: One Valero Place (OVP) and Two
Valero Place (TVP). In December 2003, Valero’s board of directors authorized the sale of OVP and
TVP for $27.3 million. As a result, a $25.8 million impairment charge was recognized in December
2003 to write down the carrying amount of OVP and TVP to their fair values less selling costs. The
impairment charge was reflected in “depreciation and amortization expense” in the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003, and was included in the corporate
category for segment reporting purposes as shown in

All of Valero’s goodwill has been allocated among four reporting units that comprise the refining
segment. These reporting units are the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Northeast and West Coast
refining regions. Valero completed its annual test for impairment of goodwill as of October 1,
2004, 2003 and 2002. Based on the results of the tests, there was no impairment of goodwill.

9. INVESTMENT IN AND TRANSACTIONS WITH VALERO L.P.

As of December 31, 2002, Valero owned 73.6% of Valero L.P., a limited partnership that owns and
operates crude oil and refined product pipeline, terminalling and storage tank assets. A wholly
owned subsidiary of Valero serves as the general partner of Valero L.P. As of December 31, 2004
and 2003, Valero owned 45.7% of Valero L.P.

Effective March 18, 2003, Valero L.P. issued 5,750,000 common units to the public for aggregate
proceeds of $211.3 million and completed a private placement of $250 million of debt. The net
proceeds, after issuance costs, of $200.3 million and $247.3 million, respectively, combined with
borrowings under Valero L.P.’s credit facility and a contribution of $4.3 million by Valero to
maintain its 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P., were used to fund a redemption of common
units from Valero and the acquisition of certain storage tanks and a pipeline system from Valero
discussed further below.

Subsequent to Valero L.P.’s equity and debt offerings, Valero L.P. redeemed 3.8 million of its
common units from Valero for $137.0 million, including $2.9 million representing the redemption of
a proportionate amount of Valero’s general partner interest. The proceeds from the redemption are
reflected as a reduction to Valero’s investment in Valero L.P. This redemption, combined with the
common unit issuance discussed above, reduced Valero’s ownership of Valero L.P. to 49.5% as of
March 18, 2003. At the same time, Valero L.P. amended its partnership agreement to reduce the
minimum vote required to remove the general partner from



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

66-2/3% to 58% of Valero L.P.’s outstanding common and subordinated units, excluding the units
held by affiliates of Valero (see discussion below for subsequent revisions to this minimum vote
which were effective on March 11, 2004). As a result of the issuance and redemption of Valero L.P.
common units and the partnership agreement changes, effective March 18, 2003, Valero ceased
consolidation of Valero L.P. and began using the equity method to account for its investment.

Subsequent to the equity and debt offerings and the common unit redemption by Valero L.P. discussed
above, Valero contributed to Valero L.P. 58 crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks
located at Valero’s Corpus Christi West, Texas City and Benicia Refineries for $200 million.
Valero also contributed to Valero L.P. a refined products pipeline system for $150 million. This
three-pipeline system connects Valero’s Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West and Three Rivers
Refineries to markets in Houston, San Antonio and the Texas Rio Grande Valley. The contribution of
the storage tank assets and the pipeline system resulted in proceeds in excess of the carrying
amounts of the contributed assets of $181.2 million for Valero. Based upon Valero’s continuing
equity ownership interest in Valero L.P., $89.7 million of this excess was recorded as a reduction
to Valero’s investment in Valero L.P. and is being amortized over the lives of the contributed
assets. The remaining $91.5 million was deferred and recorded in “other long-term liabilities” and
is being amortized over the life of certain throughput, handling, terminalling and service
agreements discussed below, which is approximately 10 years.

No immediate gain was recognized as a result of the transactions discussed above.

In connection with the contribution of the crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks and
the three-pipeline system discussed above, Valero entered into certain throughput, handling,
terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P. In addition, Valero has other related-party
transactions with Valero L.P. for the use of Valero L.P.’s pipelines, terminals and crude oil
storage tank facilities. Under various agreements, Valero has agreed to use Valero L.P.’s
pipelines to transport crude oil shipped to and refined products shipped from certain of Valero’s
refineries and to use Valero L.P.’s refined product terminals for certain terminalling services.
In addition, Valero provides personnel to Valero L.P. to perform operating and maintenance services
with respect to certain assets for which Valero receives reimbursement from Valero L.P. Valero has
indemnified Valero L.P. for certain environmental liabilities related to assets sold by Valero to
Valero L.P. that were known on the date the assets were sold or are discovered within a specified
number of years after the assets were sold as a result of events occurring or conditions existing
prior to the date of sale. Beginning March 18, 2003, the date Valero ceased consolidating Valero
L.P., Valero recognized in “cost of sales” both its costs related to the throughput, handling,
terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P. and the receipt from Valero L.P. of payment
for operating and maintenance services provided by Valero to Valero L.P.

Valero provides Valero L.P. with the corporate functions of legal, accounting, treasury,
engineering, information technology and other services for an annual fee (Administrative Fee),
which was originally established at $5.2 million. On March 11, 2004, an amendment to the
Administrative Fee was approved. Under the amendment, which became effective on April 1, 2004, the
new Administrative Fee is equal to the actual cost of Valero’s corporate employees dedicated to
Valero L.P. matters plus an annual fee of $1.2 million. The annual fee of $1.2 million will be
increased by $1.2 million per year through the expiration of the agreement in July 2008. The
annual fee may also be adjusted to account for changed service levels due to Valero L.P.’s
acquisition, sale or construction of assets. The Administrative Fee is reflected by Valero as a
reduction of “general and administrative expenses.” For the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, the Administrative Fee charged to Valero L.P. was $9.7 million and $5.2 million,
respectively.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On April 16, 2003, 581,000 additional common units of Valero L.P. were issued as a result of the
exercise by the underwriters of a portion of their overallotment option related to the March 18,
2003 common unit issuance, reducing Valero’s ownership interest from 49.5% to 48.2%.

In August 2003, Valero L.P. closed on a public offering of common units, selling 1,236,250 common
units to the public at $41.15 per unit, before underwriter’s discount of $1.85 per unit. Net
proceeds from this common unit offering, which further reduced Valero’s ownership interest in
Valero L.P. to slightly below 46%, were partially used by Valero L.P. to fund its purchase from
Valero of the Southlake refined products pipeline for $29.9 million. Valero’s gain on this sale of
$2.4 million was deferred and is being recognized over future periods, with $1.2 million recorded
as a reduction to Valero’s investment in Valero L.P. and $1.2 million recorded as a deferred credit
in “other long-term liabilities.”

Effective March 11, 2004, Valero L.P. amended its partnership agreement as follows:

•

capped the general partner’s distribution, including incentive distributions, at 25% for
all distributions in excess of $0.66 per unit per quarter and

•

reduced the minimum vote required to remove the general partner from 58% to a simple
majority of Valero L.P.’s outstanding common and subordinated units, excluding the units
held by affiliates of Valero.

Proposed Merger

On November 1, 2004, Valero L.P. announced a proposed merger valued at approximately $2.8 billion
in which Valero L.P. will acquire Kaneb Services LLC (Kaneb Services) and Kaneb Pipe Line Partners,
L.P. (Kaneb Partners). The boards of directors of the respective entities approved the terms
of the proposed transaction, and on March 11, 2005, the proposed transaction was approved by
the shareholders of Kaneb Services and the unitholders of both Kaneb Partners and Valero L.P. The
completion of the proposed merger is subject to customary regulatory approvals.

Valero expects to contribute approximately $28 million to Valero L.P. to maintain Valero’s 2%
general partner interest in Valero L.P., and Valero’s total ownership interest in Valero L.P.,
including the 2% general partner interest, is anticipated to be reduced to approximately 23% as a
result of the merger.

10. DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS

Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project

Effective July 10, 2003, Valero and GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P. (GulfTerra, formerly El Paso
Energy Partners, L.P.) each became a 50% interest owner in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline
Company, a general partnership formed to construct and operate a crude oil pipeline (the Cameron
Highway Oil Pipeline Project). Enterprise Product Partners, L.P. and affiliates (Enterprise) have
since acquired GulfTerra’s interests in the project. The project involves the construction and
operation of a 390-mile crude oil pipeline that is expected to deliver up to 500,000 barrels per
day from the Gulf of Mexico to the major refining areas of Port Arthur and Texas City, Texas.
Enterprise will operate the pipeline, which began operations during the first quarter of 2005.
Valero’s investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project is accounted for using the equity
method and is included in “deferred charges and other assets, net” in the consolidated balance
sheet. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Valero’s investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline
Project totaled $140.4 million and $106.1 million, respectively.

Investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P.

As of December 31, 2004, Valero and Hoechst Celanese Chemical Group, Inc. (Celanese) each held a
50% ownership interest in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. (Clear Lake), a limited partnership
formed in 1994 for the purpose of refurbishing and operating Celanese’s methanol production
facility in Clear Lake, Texas. Under the terms of the limited partnership arrangement, Valero and
Celanese historically have each provided 50% of the natural gas processed at the facility and have
taken 50% of the methanol produced by the facility. In December 2004, Valero secured a more
economical supply of methanol from other sources and made the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

decision to discontinue its
participation in the Clear Lake joint venture beginning in the second half of 2005. As a result,
an impairment charge of $57.2 million was recognized in December 2004 to write off the carrying
amount of Valero’s equity investment in Clear Lake. The impairment charge was reflected in “other
income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31,
2004. This equity investment was
previously included in the refining reporting segment as shown in Note 21. As of December 31, 2004, no additional costs have been accrued by Valero in connection
with the termination of its participation in the Clear Lake joint venture. As of December 31, 2004
and 2003, Valero’s investment in the Clear Lake joint venture totaled zero and $60.6 million,
respectively.

Tesoro Notes Receivable

In conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, the Federal Trade Commission approved a consent decree
requiring the divestiture of certain UDS assets. Those assets and their related operations were
referred to as the Golden Eagle Business and included the 168,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle
Refinery, the related wholesale marketing business and branded retail stores located in northern
California.

In May 2002, the Golden Eagle Business was sold to Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro).
Valero received cash proceeds of $925 million and two ten-year junior subordinated notes with face
amounts totaling $150 million as follows:

•

a $100 million note, due July 17, 2012, which was non-interest bearing for the first
five years and carried a 7.5% interest rate for the remaining five-year period, and

•

a $50 million note, due July 17, 2012, which bore no interest during the first year and
carried interest at approximately 7.5% for years two through ten.

The two notes were recorded with an initial fair value of $58.9 million using a discount rate of
16%, which represented Valero’s best estimate of the fair value of the notes at the closing date of
the sale. The discount was being amortized over the life of the notes and was reported as interest
income in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of income. The notes
receivable were included in Valero’s consolidated balance sheet in “deferred charges and other
assets, net.”

In November 2003, the Tesoro notes were sold to various investors. Valero received net proceeds of
$89.6 million. The net book value of the notes at the time of sale was $72.6 million, resulting in
a gain of $17.0 million, which was reported in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The increase in accrued employee benefit costs is due mainly to higher bonus accruals as of
December 31, 2004 as a result of the increased operating income reported during 2004. The increase
in derivative liabilities is related to an increase in unrealized losses on cash flow hedge
derivative activity primarily related to forward sales of distillates
and associated crude oil purchases. Accrued expenses for
contingent earn-out payments resulted from the purchase price allocation for the St. Charles
Acquisition as discussed in Notes 2 and 23. Included in other accrued expenses are accruals for capital expenditures, legal and
regulatory liabilities, insurance, operating leases and miscellaneous accruals for refining and
retail operations.

Revolving Bank Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Valero had two revolving bank credit facilities which provide for
commitments of $750 million for a five-year term and $750 million for a three-year term. Subject
to the commitment amounts and terms, Valero’s two revolving bank credit facilities provide for
borrowings to be made at various amounts, maturities and interest rates, at the option of Valero.
Valero will also be charged various fees and expenses in connection with these facilities,
including facility fees and various letter of credit fees. The interest rates and fees under these
facilities are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to Valero’s long-term
debt. These facilities include certain covenants, including a coverage ratio and a
debt-to-capitalization ratio. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, letters of credit outstanding
under these committed facilities totaled $278.9 million and $245.0 million, respectively.

In addition to Valero’s two $750 million revolving bank credit facilities, a Canadian subsidiary of
Valero has a committed revolving credit facility under which it may borrow and obtain letters of
credit up to Cdn. $115 million. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, Valero had Cdn. $8.2 million and Cdn. $7.8 million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under the Canadian revolving credit
facility.

Valero also has various uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, Valero had no borrowings outstanding under its uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities;
however, there were $218.1 million and $256.1 million, respectively, of letters of credit
outstanding under such facilities. Valero’s uncommitted credit facilities have no commitment or
other fees or compensating balance requirements and are unsecured and unrestricted as to use.

Other Long-Term Debt

On June 4, 2003, Valero issued $300 million of 4.75% notes due June 15, 2013 under its prior shelf
registration statement. Interest is payable semi-annually. The notes are unsecured and are
redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valero’s option. The net proceeds from this offering of $296.8
million were used to redeem $200 million of TOPrS discussed below in Note 14 and $100 million of 8%
debentures due 2023. A premium of $3.8 million was paid and expensed in the second quarter of 2003
as a result of the early redemption of the 8% debentures.

In August 2003, $13.6 million of 6.797% notes became outstanding as a result of the cash settlement
of certain purchase contract obligations associated with Valero’s PEPS Units. See Note 14 below
for a further discussion of the PEPS Units and the resulting $13.6 million of outstanding notes.

On March 22, 2004, Valero issued $200 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due April 1, 2009 and $200
million of 4.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2014 under its prior shelf registration statement
(together, the Notes). Interest is payable on the Notes on April 1 and October 1 of each year
beginning October 1, 2004. The Notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at
Valero’s option. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under Valero’s
revolving bank credit facilities.

On March 25, 2004, Valero entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with a total
notional amount of $200 million to hedge against changes in interest rates. These interest rate
swap contracts have the effect of converting the $200 million of 4.75% Senior Notes from fixed rate
to floating rate debt.

On March 29, 2004, Valero borrowed $200 million under a five-year term loan, with a maturity date
of March 31, 2009 and bearing interest based on Valero’s debt rating. Principal payments were
scheduled to



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

begin March 2007 with a $50.0 million principal payment due at that time and
semi-annual payments of $37.5 million due thereafter until maturity. Valero used the net proceeds
from this borrowing to repay borrowings under its revolving bank credit facilities. In December
2004, Valero repaid the entire outstanding balance of the term loan.

In December 2004, Valero repurchased $40.5 million of the 7.375% notes due in March 2006 and $27.9
million of the 6.125% notes due in April 2007. A premium of $3.7 million was paid and expensed in
the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the early redemption of these notes. During January
2005, Valero repurchased $39.5 million of its 7.375% notes due in 2006 and $42.1 million of its
6.125% notes due in 2007 at a premium of $4.0 million. In addition, during February 2005, Valero
made a scheduled debt repayment of $46.0 million related to its 7.44% medium-term notes.

Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities and other long-term debt arrangements contain various
customary restrictive covenants, including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses.

Environmental liabilities reflect the long-term portion of Valero’s estimated remediation costs for
environmental matters as discussed in Note 24. The liability for
contingent earn-out payments resulted from the purchase price allocation for the St. Charles
Acquisition as discussed in Note 2. Deferred gain reflects the
unamortized balance of a portion of the proceeds in excess of the carrying amount of assets
contributed and sold by Valero to Valero L.P. as discussed in Note 9. Insurance liabilities reflect reserves established by Valero’s two captive insurance
subsidiaries, self-insured liabilities and obligations for losses related to Valero’s participation
in certain mutual insurance companies. See Note 1 under “

Asset
Retirement Obligations

” for a discussion of the liability related to asset retirement obligations
reflected in the table above. Tax liabilities other than income taxes include long-term
liabilities for franchise taxes and excise taxes as well as interest accrued on all tax-related
liabilities, including income taxes.

Unfavorable lease obligations reflect the fair value of liabilities assumed in connection with the
UDS Acquisition related to lease agreements for retail facilities and vessel charters. In June
2003, Valero purchased certain convenience stores which were subject to structured lease
arrangements for approximately $215 million. Approximately $88 million of the payment was recorded
as a reduction of the unfavorable lease obligation that was recorded in connection with the UDS
Acquisition.

Included in “other” are liabilities for various matters including legal and regulatory liabilities,
derivative obligations and various contractual obligations.

14. COMPANY-OBLIGATED PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS

TOPrS

In conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, Valero assumed $200 million of 8.32% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (TOPrS) (8,000,000 units at $25.00 per unit), which were issued by UDS Capital
I (the Trust). Distributions on the TOPrS were cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears if and
when the Trust had funds



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

available for distribution. In June 2003, the TOPrS were redeemed with
proceeds from the issuance of $300 million of 4.75% notes as described in Note 12.

PEPS Units

In June 2000, Valero issued $172.5 million of Premium Equity Participating Securities (PEPS Units)
under a shelf registration statement (6,900,000 units at $25.00 per unit). Upon issuance, each
PEPS Unit consisted of a trust preferred security issued by VEC Trust I and an associated purchase
contract obligating the holder of the PEPS Unit to purchase on August 18, 2003 a number of shares
of common stock from Valero for $25 per purchase contract. The number of shares of common stock
issuable for each purchase contract was to be determined at a price based on the average price of
Valero common stock for the relevant 20-day trading period. Under the original agreement, holders
of PEPS Units could settle their purchase contracts by paying cash to Valero or by remarketing
their pledged trust preferred securities and using the proceeds from the remarketing to settle the
purchase contracts. In accordance with the original agreement, the distribution rate on the trust
preferred securities, which was 7.75% on date of issuance, was to be reset on August 18, 2003 based
on the price for which the trust preferred securities were remarketed. In accordance with the
terms of the trust, on August 12, 2003, Valero dissolved the trust and substituted its senior
deferrable notes for the trust preferred securities. As a result, Valero’s senior deferrable notes
were scheduled to be remarketed in place of the trust preferred securities, with the interest rate
on the senior deferrable notes to be reset on August 18, 2003 based upon the price for which the
senior deferrable notes were remarketed.

The remarketing of the senior deferrable notes was scheduled for August 13, 2003. The holders of
approximately 6.36 million PEPS Units opted to settle their purchase contract obligations by
remarketing the senior deferrable notes (totaling $158.9 million), while holders of approximately
0.54 million PEPS Units elected to settle their purchase contract obligations with cash and retain
their senior deferrable notes (totaling $13.6 million) in lieu of participating in the remarketing.
On August 13, Valero received notice from the remarketing agent that a failed remarketing (as
defined in the prospectus supplement related to the PEPS Units) of the senior deferrable notes was
deemed to have occurred. The $158.9 million of senior deferrable notes surrendered to Valero to
satisfy the holders’ purchase contract obligations were retained by Valero in full satisfaction of
the holders’ obligations under the purchase contracts and were canceled on August 18, 2003. The
remaining $13.6 million of senior deferrable notes mature on August 18, 2005 and bear an interest
rate of 6.797%. Valero, in turn, issued 9.9 million shares of its common stock at a price of
$17.475 per share in settlement of the 6.9 million purchase contracts.

Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon settlement of the purchase contract
obligations, the number of shares of Valero common stock included in the calculation of “earnings
per common share – assuming dilution” for each reporting period was calculated using the treasury
stock method. For this purpose, the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the purchase
contract obligations was based on the applicable conversion formula in the PEPS Unit agreement,
using the average closing price of Valero’s common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on
the third trading day prior to the end of the reporting period.

2% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock

In connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery from Orion, effective July 1, 2003,
Valero issued 10 million shares of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock. The mandatory
convertible preferred stock had a fair value of $22 per share, or an aggregate of $220 million. Of
this amount, $21.3 million was attributable to beneficial conversion terms of the preferred stock
and was recorded in “additional paid-in capital” in the consolidated balance sheets, with the
remaining $198.7 million reflected as “preferred stock.” The resulting $21.3 million preferred
stock discount is being amortized as additional preferred stock dividends through June 30, 2006,
the day before the mandatory conversion of the preferred stock as discussed below.

The mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to Valero common stock on July
1, 2006, unless converted sooner. Valero pays annual dividends of $0.50 for each share of
convertible preferred stock when and if declared by its board of directors. Dividends are paid
quarterly, provided that dividends will not accrue or be payable with respect to a particular
calendar quarter if Valero does not declare a dividend on its common stock during that calendar
quarter. The convertible preferred stock ranks with respect to dividend rights and rights upon
Valero’s liquidation, winding-up or dissolution as follows:

(i)

senior to all common stock and to all other capital stock of Valero issued in the
future that ranks junior to the convertible preferred stock;

(ii)

on a parity with any of Valero’s capital stock issued in the future the terms of which
expressly provide that it will rank on a parity with the convertible preferred stock; and



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(iii)

junior to all of Valero’s capital stock the terms of which expressly provide that such
capital stock will rank senior to the convertible preferred stock.

The holders of the convertible preferred stock will generally be entitled to vote with Valero
common stock and not as a separate class and have a number of votes equal to the mandatory
conversion ratio that would be in effect if the mandatory conversion date was the record date of
such vote. The affirmative vote of holders of 66-2/3% of the convertible preferred stock is
necessary to make any change to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws that would adversely
affect any power, preference or special right of the convertible preferred stock.

Upon automatic conversion of the convertible preferred stock on July 1, 2006, the number of shares
of common stock to be received for each share of convertible preferred stock shall be based on the applicable market value of Valero’s
common stock, which is two times the
average closing price of Valero’s common stock over the 20-day
trading period ending on the second
trading day prior to July 1, 2006, as follows:

•

1.338 shares if the applicable market value is less than or
equal to $37.37;

•

a fractional number of shares having a value of $25 if the
applicable market value is
between $37.37 and $50.45; or

•

0.991 shares if the applicable market value is greater than
$50.45.

Each share of convertible preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
before July 1, 2006 into 0.991 shares of Valero common stock.
The number of shares to be received upon conversion of a share of the
convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of certain events. During the third quarter of 2003,
Valero filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
to register the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon the
conversion of the convertible preferred stock. The registration statement was declared effective
on October 16, 2003. During January and February of 2005, 927,512 shares of the preferred stock
were converted into 919,162 shares of Valero common stock.

Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon conversion of the convertible preferred
stock, the number of shares of Valero common stock included in the calculation of “earnings per
common share – assuming dilution” for each reporting period will be based on the above conversion
formula using the average closing price of Valero’s common stock over the 20-day trading period
ending on the second trading day prior to the end of the reporting period.

Common Stock Offerings

On March 28, 2003, Valero sold in a public offering 12.6 million shares of its common stock at a
price of $20.125 per share and received net proceeds of $250.3 million. These shares were issued
under Valero’s prior shelf registration statement. The proceeds were used for repayment of
borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities.

On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 15.6 million shares of its common stock,
which included 2.0 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter,
at a price of $26.63 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriter’s discount, commissions
and other issuance costs, of
$405.8 million. These shares were issued under Valero’s prior shelf registration statement to
partially fund the Aruba Acquisition discussed in Note 2.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Common Stock Split

On July 15, 2004, Valero’s board of directors approved a two-for-one split of Valero’s common stock
that was effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on October
7, 2004 to stockholders of record on September 23, 2004. In connection with the stock split,
Valero’s shareholders approved on September 13, 2004, an amendment to Valero’s certificate of
incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares from 300 million to 600 million.

All share and per share data (except par value) have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the
stock split for all periods presented. In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable
upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, the exercise of outstanding stock
options and the vesting of other stock awards, as well as the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under Valero’s various employee benefit plans, were proportionately increased
in accordance with the terms of those respective agreements and plans.

Common Stock Purchases

Valero purchases shares of its common stock in open market transactions to meet its obligations
under employee benefit plans. Valero also purchases shares of its common stock from its employees
and non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of
restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, Valero purchased 9.7 million, 3.4 million and 2.1 million shares of its common
stock at a cost of $317.4 million, $73.2 million and $45.5 million, respectively.

Cash Dividends

On February 3, 2005, Valero’s board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of
$0.08 per common share payable March 16, 2005 to holders of record at the close of business on
February 16, 2005.

Also on February 3, 2005, Valero’s board of directors declared a dividend on the mandatory
convertible preferred stock of $0.125 per share payable on March 31, 2005 to holders of record on
March 30, 2005.

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts
reflected in the applicable consolidated balance sheets for the respective periods for the
following reasons:

•

the amounts shown above exclude changes in cash and temporary cash investments, deferred
income taxes, short-term debt, and current portion of long-term debt and capital lease
obligations;

•

the amounts shown above exclude the current assets and current liabilities acquired in
connection with the Aruba Acquisition in 2004 and the St. Charles Acquisition in 2003,
which are reflected separately in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the effect
of certain noncash investing and financing activities discussed below; and

•

certain differences between consolidated balance sheet changes and consolidated
statement of cash flow changes reflected above result from translating foreign currency
denominated amounts at different exchange rates.

Noncash investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 included various adjustments to
property, plant and equipment and certain current and other noncurrent assets and liabilities
resulting from adjustments to the purchase price allocations related to the Aruba and St. Charles
Acquisitions discussed in Note 2 (including recognition of the $175 million of potential earn-out
payments related to the St. Charles Acquisition).

Noncash investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 included:

•

the issuance of 9.1 million shares of common stock in exchange for the settlement of
6.36 million PEPS Unit purchase contracts under the remarketing election;

•

the issuance of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $220
million as partial consideration for the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery from
Orion;

•

the recognition of a $30.0 million asset retirement obligation and associated asset
retirement cost in accordance with Statement No. 143; and



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

•

adjustments to property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and certain current and other
noncurrent assets and liabilities associated with the change to cease consolidation of
Valero L.P. and use the equity method to account for Valero’s investment in Valero L.P.
effective March 18, 2003.

Noncash investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 included:

•

the adjustment to goodwill and assets held for sale to reflect the difference between
estimated and actual proceeds received on the liquidation of the investment in Diamond-Koch
and the disposition of the Golden Eagle Business;

•

the receipt of $150 million of notes from Tesoro with an estimated fair value of $58.9
million in connection with the disposition of the Golden Eagle Business; and

•

various adjustments to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and certain current and
other noncurrent assets and liabilities resulting from adjustments to the purchase price

18. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

Commodity Price Risk

Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product
prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. To
reduce the impact of this price volatility, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments (swaps,
futures and options) to manage its exposure to:

•

changes in the fair value of a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product
inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these
inventories (fair value hedges);

•

changes in cash flows of certain forecasted transactions such
as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, natural gas purchases and refined product sales (cash flow hedges); and

•

price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain
forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product
sales and natural gas purchases that are not designated as either fair
value or cash flow hedges (economic hedges).

In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its
fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions.

Interest Rate Risk

Valero is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to certain of its long-term
debt obligations. Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage Valero’s fixed to floating
interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency Risk

Valero is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its Canadian operations.
To manage its exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, Valero uses foreign currency exchange
and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.

Current Period Disclosures

The net gain (loss) recognized in income representing the amount of hedge ineffectiveness was as
follows (in millions):

Year Ended December 31,




Fair value hedges

$

(0.5

)

$

4.8

$

(1.2

)

Cash flow hedges

(9.8

)

4.1

29.3

The above amounts were included in “cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income. No
component of the derivative instruments’ gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. No amounts were recognized in income for hedged firm commitments that no longer
qualify as fair value hedges.

For cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently reported in “accumulated other comprehensive
income” in the consolidated balance sheets will be reclassified into income when the forecasted
transactions affect income. During the year ended December 31, 2004, Valero recognized in
“accumulated other comprehensive income” unrealized after-tax losses of $167.3 million on certain
cash flow hedges, primarily related to forward sales of distillates and associated crude oil
purchases, with $48.7 million of cumulative after-tax losses on cash flow hedges remaining in
“accumulated other comprehensive income” as of December 31, 2004. Valero expects that all of these
losses will be reclassified into income in 2005 as a result of hedged transactions that are
forecasted to occur. The amount ultimately realized in income, however, will differ as commodity
prices change. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were no amounts
reclassified from “accumulated other comprehensive income” into income as a result of the
discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting.

Market and Credit Risk

Valero’s price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments
into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in
market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. Valero closely monitors and manages its
exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by its board of
directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valero’s
stated risk management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact
Valero’s overall exposure to credit risk, in that these customers may be similarly affected by
changes in economic or other conditions. Valero believes that its counterparties will be able to
satisfy their obligations under their price risk management contracts with Valero.

19. PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

Each outstanding share of Valero’s common stock is accompanied by one preferred share purchase
right (Right). With certain exceptions, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from
Valero .005 of a share of Valero’s Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series I at a
price of $100 per .005 of a share, subject to adjustment for certain recapitalization
events.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Rights are transferable only with the common stock until the earlier of:

•

10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or
associated persons (Acquiring Person) has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
the outstanding shares of Valero’s common stock,

•

10 business days (or later date as may be determined by Valero’s board of directors)
following the initiation of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in an
Acquiring Person having beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding common
stock (the earlier of these two options being called the Rights Separation Date), or

•

the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Rights Separation Date. At any time prior to the
acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding
common stock, Valero’s board of directors may redeem the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right. The
Rights will expire on June 30, 2007, unless the Rights are extended or are earlier redeemed or
exchanged by Valero.

If after the Rights Separation Date, Valero is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction, or if 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power is sold, each holder of
a Right will have the right to receive, upon the exercise of the Right at its then current exercise
price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of the
transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In the event
that any Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding
common stock, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person
(which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that
number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the
Right.

At any time after an Acquiring Person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valero’s
outstanding common stock and prior to the acquisition by the Acquiring Person of 50% or more of
Valero’s outstanding common stock, Valero’s board of directors may exchange the Right (other than
Rights owned by the Acquiring Person which have become void), at an exchange ratio of one share of
common stock, or .005 of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, per Right (subject to
adjustment).

Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of Valero including,
without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. The Rights may have certain
anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that
attempts to acquire Valero on terms not approved by Valero’s board of directors, except pursuant to
an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights should not
interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by Valero’s board of directors
since the Rights may be redeemed by Valero prior to the time that an Acquiring Person has acquired
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding common stock.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Valero has recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, due to uncertainties
related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of
certain state net operating losses, state tax credits and foreign tax credits, before they expire.
The valuation allowance is based on Valero’s estimates of taxable income in the various
jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be
recoverable. The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2004 is
dependent upon Valero’s ability to generate future taxable income in the United States, Canada
and Aruba.

Subsequently recognized tax benefits related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as
of December 31, 2004 will be allocated as follows (in millions):

U.S. federal deferred income taxes and Canadian withholding taxes have not been provided for on the
undistributed earnings of Valero’s Canadian and Aruban subsidiaries based on the determination that
those earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2004, the cumulative
undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately $1.0 billion. If those earnings
were not considered indefinitely reinvested, U.S. federal deferred income taxes and Canadian
withholding taxes would have been recorded after consideration of
foreign tax credits. However, it is not practicable to estimate the
amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income
if distributed.

Valero’s separate tax years through 1999 and UDS’s tax years through 1994 and for 1998 and 1999 are
closed to adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service. UDS’s separate tax years 1995 through 1997,
2000 and 2001 are currently under examination. Valero’s separate tax years 2000 and 2001 are
currently under examination. In addition, Valero’s tax years 2002 and 2003 are currently under
examination. Valero believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been reflected in the
consolidated financial statements.

21. SEGMENT INFORMATION

Valero has two reportable segments, refining and retail. Valero’s refining segment includes
refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation
operations. The retail segment includes company-operated convenience stores, Canadian
dealers/jobbers and truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities and home heating oil operations.
Operations that are not included in either of the two reportable segments are included in the
corporate category.

The reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.
They are managed separately as each business requires unique technology and marketing strategies.
Performance is evaluated based on operating income. Intersegment sales are generally derived from
transactions made at prevailing market rates.

22. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

Valero has several qualified non-contributory defined benefit plans (the Qualified Plans),
including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition, some of which are subject to collective bargaining
agreements. The Qualified Plans cover substantially all employees in the United States and
generally provide eligible employees with retirement income based on years of service and
compensation during specific periods. Effective March 1 and April 1, 2002, certain classes of
former UDS retail employees ceased accruing benefits under Valero’s qualified pension plan.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Valero also has various nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans (Supplemental Plans),
including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition, which provide additional pension benefits to
executive officers and certain other employees. The Supplemental Plans and the Qualified Plans are
collectively referred to as the Pension Plans.

Valero also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees,
referred to as other postretirement benefits. Substantially all of Valero’s employees may become
eligible for these benefits if, while still working for Valero, they either reach normal retirement
age or take early retirement. Valero offers health care benefits through a self-insured plan and a
health maintenance organization while life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance
company. Valero funds its postretirement benefits other than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Individuals who became Valero employees as a result of an acquisition by Valero became eligible for
other postretirement benefits under Valero’s plan as determined by terms of the relevant
acquisition agreement.

As discussed in Note 1 under

“Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,”

the FASB has provided
guidance on accounting for the effects of the Act for sponsors of postretirement health care plans.
Valero incorporated the effects of the Act into the regular measurement of plan obligations as of
December 31, 2004, which resulted in a $15.4 million reduction in the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and a $1.8 million reduction in the estimated net

Equity securities in the Qualified Plans include Valero common stock in the amounts of
approximately $94 million (16% of total Qualified Plan assets) and $48 million (10% of total
Qualified Plan assets) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The investment policies and strategies for the assets of Valero’s Qualified Plans incorporate a
well-diversified approach which is expected to earn long-term returns from capital appreciation and
a growing stream of current income. This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and
the market value of the Qualified Plans’ assets may fluctuate from year to year. Risk tolerance is
determined based on Valero’s financial ability to withstand risk within the investment program and
the willingness to accept return volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk
parameters, the Qualified Plans’ mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity and
fixed-income investments. Equity investments include international stocks and a blend of domestic
growth and value stocks of various sizes of capitalization. The aggregate asset allocation is
reviewed on an annual basis.

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Qualified Plans is estimated
using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the
assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient. Three methods are used to derive
the long-term expected returns for each asset class. Since each method has distinct advantages and
disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average of the methods’ results is used.

Although Valero has no minimum required contributions to its Qualified Plans during 2005 under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Valero expects to contribute $60 million to its Qualified
Plans during 2005.

Profit-Sharing/Savings Plans

Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan

Valero is the sponsor of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan, which is a qualified employee
profit-sharing plan. Participation in the Thrift Plan is voluntary and is open to Valero employees
who become eligible to participate upon the completion of one month of continuous service. This
service may include prior employment with other companies acquired by Valero.

Thrift Plan participants can make basic contributions from 2% up to 8% of their total annual
compensation, which includes overtime and cash bonuses. In addition, participants who make a basic
contribution of 8% can also make a supplemental contribution of up to 22% of their total annual
compensation. During 2002 and 2003,
the maximum match by Valero was 75% of each participant’s basic contributions up to 8% based on the
participant’s total annual compensation, with the exception of the period from January 1, 2002
through February 1, 2002 during which employer contributions were equal to 100% of employee
contributions up to 8%. Effective December 31, 2003, the Thrift Plan was amended to exclude cash
bonuses payable for periods after December 31, 2002, from the participant’s total annual
compensation for purposes of calculating Valero’s matching contribution.

Valero’s contributions to the Thrift Plan for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$26.6 million, $24.0 million and $20.9 million, respectively.

Valero Savings Plan

In connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero became the plan sponsor of the Valero Savings Plan
(Savings Plan, formerly the UDS 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan). The Savings Plan is a defined
contribution plan that previously covered all eligible employees of UDS. Under the Savings Plan,
participants can contribute from 1% to 30% of their compensation. Valero contributes $0.60 for
every $1.00 of the participant’s contribution up to 6% of compensation. Effective January 1, 2002,
the company matching contributions for certain non-store employees of UDS was changed to 75% of up
to 8% of employee contributions. Effective April 1, 2002, certain non-store employees of UDS were
no longer eligible to participate in the Savings Plan, but became eligible to participate in the
Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan.

Valero’s contributions to the Savings Plan for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $4.7 million, $4.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

Stock Compensation Plans

Valero has various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans, which are summarized as

23. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

Valero has long-term operating lease commitments for land, office facilities, retail facilities and
related equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal
vessels, dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation,
production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products.

Certain leases for production equipment and feedstock and refined product storage facilities
provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in excess
of a base amount. Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which
vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on
usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage.
Leases for convenience stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on
sales volumes. In most cases, Valero expects that in the normal course of business, its leases
will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

As of December 31, 2004, Valero’s future minimum rental payments and minimum rentals to be received
under subleases for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one
year were as reflected in the following table (in millions).

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Structured Lease Arrangements

During 2002, 2003 and the early part of 2004, Valero had various long-term operating lease
commitments that were funded through structured lease arrangements with non-consolidated third
party entities (the lessors). These leases were for land, office facilities and equipment, retail
facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and
equipment used in the production of refined products. The lessors constructed or purchased the
related assets and then leased them to Valero. The assets held by these lessors were funded
through equity contributions of the lessors ranging from 3% to 5% of the fair market value of the
asset and borrowings from various financial institutions. Neither Valero, its affiliates nor any
related parties held any interest in these lessors. For each lease, Valero had the option to
purchase the leased assets at any time during the lease term for a price that approximated fair
value.

In the second quarter of 2003, Valero purchased TVP and certain convenience stores, which were
subject to structured lease arrangements, for approximately $23 million and $215 million,
respectively. Of the payment for the convenience stores, approximately $127 million was recorded
as an increase to “property, plant and equipment” and approximately $88 million reduced an
unfavorable lease obligation that was recorded in conjunction with the UDS Acquisition. In
December 2003, Valero purchased OVP for $34 million.

In March 2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties under each of its four
remaining structured lease arrangements, and these leased properties, which totaled $567.1 million,
were purchased through borrowings under Valero’s existing bank credit facilities.

Other Commitments

Valero has various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply
arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply
arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these
contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its
refineries. Many of Valero’s purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based
on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on Valero’s usage requirements. The purchase obligations
reflected below include both short-term and long-term obligations as of December 31, 2004, and are
based on minimum quantities to be purchased and/or estimated prices to be paid under the agreements
based on current market conditions. These purchase obligations are not reflected in the
consolidated balance sheets.

Estimated future annual purchase obligations as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (in millions):

eligible trade and credit card

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

receivables, which matures in October 2005. As of December 31,
2004, the amount of eligible receivables sold to
the third-party financial institutions was $600 million.

Guarantees

In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in 2002, Valero guaranteed certain lease
payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which totaled approximately $34 million
as of December 31, 2004. This lease expires in 2010. Valero was not required to, and did not,
make any payments under this guarantee for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Contingent Earn-Out Agreements

In connection with Valero’s acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the Paulsboro
Refinery in 1998 and Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in
any of the seven, five and ten years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average
refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level. The following table
summarizes the payments made and payment limitations for these acquisitions (in millions):

No future earn-out payments related to the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery will be due as the
term of the earn-out arrangement expired in September 2003.

For the acquisitions of the Paulsboro Refinery and Basis Petroleum, Inc., Valero accounts for
payments under these arrangements as an additional cost of the respective acquisition when the
payments are made. As of December 31, 2004, $59.3 million of the aggregate earn-out payments
related to these acquisitions had been attributed to “property, plant and equipment” and is being
depreciated over the remaining lives of the assets to which the additional cost was allocated and
$115.5 million had been attributed to “goodwill” and is not being amortized.

As discussed in Note 2, a liability for the aggregate limit of potential earn-out payments totaling
$175 million related to the St. Charles Acquisition was accrued as of December 31, 2004. The
offsetting amount is reflected in “property, plant and equipment” and is being depreciated over the
remaining lives of the assets to which the cost was allocated as part of the purchase price
allocation. In January 2005, Valero made an earn-out payment of $50.0 million related to the St.
Charles Acquisition.

24. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude

of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a
formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable
undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as
well as Valero’s own internal environmental policies.

The balance of and changes in the accruals for environmental matters, which are principally
included in “other long-term liabilities” described in Note 13, were as follows (in millions):

In connection with its various acquisitions, Valero assumed several environmental liabilities
including, but not limited to, certain remediation obligations, site restoration costs and certain
liabilities relating to soil and groundwater remediation. The additional accrual related to the
UDS Acquisition in 2002 was primarily to conform the assessment of environmental liabilities
resulting from the UDS Acquisition by utilizing the same 20-year time period over which
environmental liabilities are determined under Valero’s policy.

Valero believes that it has adequately provided for its environmental exposures with the accruals
referred to above. These liabilities have not been reduced by potential future recoveries from
third parties. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
factors such as the timing and extent of remediation, the determination of Valero’s obligation in
proportion to other parties, improvements in remediation technologies, and the extent to which
environmental laws and regulations may change in the future.

In 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued to a majority of refiners operating
in the United States a series of information requests pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act
as part of an enforcement initiative. Valero received a Section 114 information request pertaining
to all of its refineries owned at that time. Valero completed its response to the request, and it
has not been named in any enforcement proceeding by the EPA. Several other refiners, however, have
either reached global settlements with the EPA regarding this enforcement initiative or have been
subject to enforcement proceedings by the



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

EPA. Valero believes that it will be able to reach a
settlement with the EPA during 2005 applicable to all of its U.S. refineries. Valero expects to
incur penalties and related expenses in connection with a potential settlement, but Valero believes
that any settlement penalties will be immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and
financial position. In addition, Valero expects that a settlement of this matter will require
significant capital improvements or changes in operating parameters, or both, at most of Valero’s
refineries. However, Valero expects that most of the required capital improvements or changes in
operating parameters will be consistent with many of Valero’s existing or forecasted strategic
capital projects or emission reduction projects already planned for the next several years.

25. LITIGATION MATTERS

Unocal

In 2002, Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) sued Valero alleging patent infringement. The
complaint seeks a 5.75 cent per gallon royalty on all reformulated gasoline infringing on Unocal’s
'393 and '126 patents. These patents cover certain compositions of cleaner-burning gasoline. The
complaint seeks treble damages for Valero’s alleged willful infringement of Unocal’s patents and
Valero’s alleged conduct to induce others to infringe the patents. In a previous lawsuit involving
its '393 patent, Unocal prevailed against five other major refiners.

In 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began an antitrust investigation concerning Unocal’s
misconduct with a joint industry research group and regulators during the time that Unocal was
prosecuting its patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). In 2003, the FTC filed a
complaint against Unocal for antitrust violations. The FTC’s complaint seeks an injunction against
future '393 or '126 patent enforcement activity by Unocal against any person or entity with respect
to gasoline to be sold in California. The trial for the FTC’s antitrust charges against Unocal
began before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on October 19, 2004. Closing arguments are expected
to occur in May 2005, with an initial decision from the ALJ expected in mid to late June 2005. The
ALJ’s decision will likely be appealed to the full Commission.

In addition to the FTC proceedings, the '393 and '126 patents are being reexamined by the PTO. The
PTO has issued notices of rejection of all claims of each of these patents. These rejections are
subject to additional proceedings, including administrative appeal by Unocal, followed by an appeal
in federal district court or the court of appeals. Ultimate invalidation would preclude Unocal
from pursuing claims based on the '393 or '126 patents.

Unocal’s patent lawsuit against Valero is indefinitely stayed as a result of the PTO reexamination
proceedings. Notwithstanding the judgment against the other refiners in the previous litigation,
Valero believes that it has several strong defenses to Unocal’s lawsuit, including those arising
from Unocal’s misconduct, and Valero believes it will prevail in the lawsuit. However, due to the
inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is reasonably possible that Valero will not prevail in the
lawsuit, and an adverse result could have a material effect on Valero’s results of operations and
financial position. An estimate of the possible loss or range of loss from such an adverse result
cannot reasonably be made

.

MTBE Litigation

As of February 28, 2005, Valero was named as a defendant in 63 cases alleging liability related to
MTBE contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water providers, governmental
authorities and private water companies alleging that refiners and marketers of MTBE and gasoline
containing MTBE are



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. Valero is named
in these suits together with many other
refining industry companies. Valero is being sued primarily as a refiner and marketer of MTBE and
gasoline containing MTBE. Valero does not own or operate gasoline station facilities in most of
the geographic locations in which damage is alleged to have occurred. The suits generally seek
individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. All but one of
these cases have been removed to federal court by the defendants and have been, or soon will be,
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. Four of these cases have been selected by the court as focus cases for discovery and
pre-trial motions. Activity in the “non-focus” cases is generally stayed pending certain
determinations in the focus cases. Valero believes that it has strong defenses to these claims and
is vigorously defending the cases. Valero believes that an adverse result in any one of these
suits would not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.
However, Valero believes that an adverse result in all or a substantial number of these cases could
have a material effect on Valero’s results of operations and financial position. An estimate of
the possible losses or range of losses from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these
cases cannot reasonably be made.

Other

Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or
proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or liquidity; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the
range of any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision and Valero
cannot provide assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have
an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
