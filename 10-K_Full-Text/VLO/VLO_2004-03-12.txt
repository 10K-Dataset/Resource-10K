Valero Energy Corporation


is a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, Texas
with approximately 20,000 employees and annual revenues of approximately $38
billion. Valero’s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
under the symbol “VLO.” Valero’s principal executive offices are located at
One Valero Place, San Antonio, Texas, 78212, and its telephone number is (210)
370-2000. When used in this report, the term “Valero” may refer, depending
upon the context, to Valero Energy Corporation, to one or more of its
consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole.

Valero’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant
to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on Valero’s
internet website at http://www.valero.com as soon as reasonably practicable
after Valero electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Valero currently owns and operates 15 refineries having a combined throughput
capacity of approximately 2.4 million barrels per day (BPD). Valero’s refining
network extends from eastern Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast and
includes the island of Aruba. Valero produces premium, environmentally clean
products such as reformulated gasoline (RFG), gasoline meeting the
specifications of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), CARB diesel fuel,
low-sulfur diesel fuel and oxygenates (liquid hydrocarbon compounds containing
oxygen). Valero also produces a substantial slate of conventional gasolines,
distillates, jet fuel, asphalt and petrochemicals.


Valero was incorporated in Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero Refining
and Marketing Company. On August 1, 1997, Valero’s name was changed from
Valero Refining and Marketing Company to Valero Energy Corporation.



Valero is also a leading marketer of refined products. Valero markets branded
and unbranded refined products on a wholesale basis in the United States and
Canada through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network. Valero also sells
refined products through a network of more than 4,500 retail and wholesale

and Beacon

®

.

Through agreements with Valero L.P., Valero also has access to a logistics
system that complements Valero’s refining and marketing assets primarily in the
U.S. Gulf Coast, West Coast and Mid-Continent regions. Valero owns
approximately 46% (including the 2% general partner interest) of Valero L.P., a
master limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil pipelines, crude
oil and intermediate feedstock storage facilities, and refined product
pipelines and terminals primarily in Texas, California, Oklahoma, New Mexico
and Colorado. Limited partner units of Valero L.P. are listed on the NYSE
under the symbol “VLI.”

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Aruba Refinery.

On March 5, 2004, Valero acquired El Paso Corporation’s
315,000 BPD Aruba refinery and certain related businesses. Valero paid $465
million for the refinery and related marine, bunkering and marketing
operations, and $162 million for working capital. The working capital amount
excludes certain inventories owned by a third-party marketing firm under an
existing agreement, which Valero plans to acquire upon termination of
such agreement (which will occur on or about May 4, 2004) for an amount estimated to be approximately $40 million based
on volumes and prices as of March 4, 2004. The
refinery is located on the island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea. It generally
processes heavy, sour crude oil, and produces a variety of gasoline
blendstocks, intermediate feedstocks and finished distillate products. Valero
plans to use significant amounts of the refinery’s feedstock production for
processing in Valero’s other refineries in the Gulf Coast, West Coast and
Northeast regions. The Aruba Refinery receives crude oil by ship at its two
deepwater marine docks which can berth ultra-large crude carriers. The
refinery’s products are delivered by ship into markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast,
Florida, the New York Harbor and the Caribbean. Valero financed the
acquisition with $200 million in cash, approximately $21 million in borrowings
under its existing credit facilities, and approximately $406 million in net
proceeds from the issuance of common equity through a public offering in
February 2004. The additional inventory to be purchased from the third-party
marketing firm described above will be funded through borrowings under Valero’s
existing credit facilities.

St. Charles Refinery.

Effective July 1, 2003, Valero purchased a refinery in
St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, from Orion Refining Corporation. The refinery’s
total feedstock throughput capacity at the end of 2003 was approximately
215,000 BPD. The purchase price for the refinery was $400 million, plus
approximately $149 million for refinery hydrocarbon inventories. Consideration
for the purchase, including various transaction costs incurred and warehouse
inventories acquired, consisted of $309 million in cash and $250 million stated
value of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock (10 million shares with a
stated value of $25.00 per share). See Notes 2 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a further discussion of the acquisition and issuance
of preferred stock.

Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project.

Effective July 10, 2003, Valero and
GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P. (GulfTerra, formerly El Paso Energy Partners,
L.P.) each became a 50% interest owner in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline
Company, a general partnership formed to construct and operate a crude oil
pipeline (the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project). The project involves the
construction and operation of a 390-mile crude oil pipeline that is expected to
deliver up to 500,000 BPD from the Gulf of Mexico to the major refining areas
of Port Arthur and Texas City, Texas. GulfTerra will build and operate the
pipeline, which is scheduled for completion during the third quarter of 2004.
For the year ended December 31, 2003, Valero’s investment



in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project totaled $106.1 million. Financing
for completion of the pipeline is provided pursuant to nonrecourse loans made
by financial institutions to the partnership.

Valero L.P.

Effective March 18, 2003, Valero L.P. issued 5,750,000 common
units to the public for aggregate proceeds of approximately $211 million and
completed a private placement of $250 million of debt. The net proceeds from
those offerings, combined with borrowings under Valero L.P.’s credit facility,
were used to fund a redemption of common units from Valero and the acquisition
of certain storage tanks and a pipeline system from Valero. On March 18, 2003,
Valero L.P. redeemed approximately 3.8 million of its common units from Valero,
which, combined with the common unit issuance, reduced Valero’s ownership of
Valero L.P. from approximately 73% to 49.5% at that time. On the same date,
Valero L.P. also amended its partnership agreement to state that the general
partner of Valero L.P. may be removed by the vote of the holders of at least
58% of Valero L.P.’s common and subordinated units, excluding the units held by
affiliates of its general partner.

As a result of the partnership agreement changes and the issuance and
redemption of Valero L.P. common units on March 18, 2003, Valero ceased
consolidation of Valero L.P. as of that date, and began using the equity method
to account for its investment in Valero L.P. Following the equity and debt
offerings and the common unit redemption discussed above, Valero contributed to
Valero L.P. certain crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks for
approximately $200 million in cash. Valero also contributed to Valero L.P. a
refined products pipeline system for approximately $150 million in cash. In
connection with these contributions, Valero entered into certain throughput,
handling, terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P.

In March 2004, various amendments to Valero L.P.’s partnership agreement were
approved. On March 11, 2004, in an effort to encourage additional investment
in Valero L.P., the board of directors of Valero agreed that the general
partner’s incentive distribution provided for in Valero L.P.’s partnership
agreement would be capped at 25%. In addition, effective March 11, 2004, Valero L.P.
amended its partnership agreement to reduce the minimum vote required to remove
the general partner from 58% to a majority of Valero L.P.’s outstanding common
and subordinated units, excluding the units held by affiliates of Valero.
Valero’s investment in and transactions with Valero L.P. are discussed further
in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

SEGMENTS

Valero’s reportable business segments are refining and retail. Valero’s
refining segment includes refining operations, wholesale marketing, product
supply and distribution, and transportation operations. The refining segment
is segregated geographically into the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, West Coast and
Northeast regions.

Valero’s retail segment includes company-operated convenience stores, Canadian
dealers/jobbers, truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities and home heating oil
operations. The retail segment is also segregated geographically. Valero’s
retail operations in the northeastern United States (which comprised a home
heating oil business that was sold in July 2003) combined with its retail
operations in eastern Canada are referred to as the Northeast System. Valero’s
remaining retail operations in the United States are referred to as the U.S.
System. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
financial information about Valero’s segments.



VALERO’S OPERATIONS

REFINING

As of December 31, 2003, Valero’s refining operations included 14 refineries in
the United States and Canada with a combined total throughput capacity of
approximately 2.1 million BPD. The following table lists the location of each

Valero processes a wide slate of feedstocks, including sour crude oils,
intermediates and resid which can typically be purchased at a discount to West
Texas Intermediate, a benchmark crude oil. In 2003, sour crude oils and resid
represented 49% of Valero’s feedstock slate, sweet crude oils represented 35%,
and the remaining 16% was composed of blendstocks and other feedstocks.

Valero’s refineries produce gasolines, distillates, asphalt and other refined
products. In 2003, gasolines and blendstocks represented 54% of Valero’s
refined product slate. Distillates – such as home heating oil, diesel fuel and
jet fuel – represented 28%, while asphalt, lubricants, petrochemicals and other
heavy products comprised the remaining 18%. Of the gasoline that Valero
produces, about 30% is reformulated gasoline and CARB gasoline, which sell at a
premium over conventional grades of gasoline. About 80% of Valero’s distillate
slate is low-sulfur diesel, CARB diesel and jet fuel, which sell at a premium
over high-sulfur heating oil.



GULF COAST

Valero’s Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East and West
Refineries, the Texas City Refinery, the St. Charles Refinery, the Houston

Corpus Christi East and West Refineries

. The Corpus Christi East and West
Refineries are located along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel on the Texas Gulf
Coast. Valero’s flagship West Refinery is a highly complex refinery that
specializes in processing primarily lower-cost sour crude oil and residual fuel
oil (resid) into premium products such as RFG and RBOB.


The East Refinery is
also a complex refinery that processes heavy, high-sulfur crude oil into
conventional gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, aromatics and other light
products. Valero has been operating the East Refinery since 2001, and has
substantially integrated the operations of the West Refinery and the East
Refinery, allowing for the transfer of various feedstocks and blending
components between the two refineries and the sharing of resources. The
refineries typically receive and deliver feedstocks and products by tanker and
barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel.
In addition, the facility has an eight-bay truck rack for servicing local
markets. The refineries use the Colonial, Explorer, Valley and other major
pipelines – including Valero L.P.’s pipelines – for distribution of refined
products.

Texas City Refinery

. The Texas City Refinery is located approximately 40 miles
southeast of Houston on the Texas City Ship Channel. The Texas City Refinery
processes primarily sour crude oils into a wide slate of products. A new
45,000 BPD coking unit and related facilities began operations at the refinery
in the fourth quarter of 2003, and enables the refinery to process heavier,
lower-cost crude oils. The refinery typically receives and delivers its
feedstocks and products by tanker and barge via deepwater docking facilities
along the Texas City Ship Channel and also has access to the Colonial, Explorer
and TEPPCO pipelines for distribution of its products.


RBOB is a base unfinished reformulated gasoline mixture known as
“reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending” or “RBOB.”



St. Charles Refinery

. The St. Charles Refinery is located approximately 15
miles from New Orleans along the Mississippi River. The refinery processes
sour crude oils and other feedstocks into a high percentage of gasoline,
distillates and other light products. The refinery receives crude oil over
five marine docks and has access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port where it
can receive crude oil through a 24-inch pipeline. Finished products can be
shipped over these docks or by pipeline into either the Plantation or Colonial
pipeline network for distribution to the eastern United States.

Houston Refinery

. The Houston Refinery is located on the Houston Ship Channel.
It generally processes sour crude oils and low-sulfur resid into conventional
gasoline and distillates. The plant also produces roofing-grade asphalt. The
refinery typically receives its feedstocks via tanker at deepwater docking
facilities along the Houston Ship Channel. The refinery primarily delivers its
products through major refined-product pipelines, including the Colonial,
Explorer and TEPPCO pipelines.

Three Rivers Refinery

. The Three Rivers Refinery is located in South Texas
between Corpus Christi and San Antonio. It generally processes heavy sweet and
sour crude oils into conventional gasoline and distillates. The Three Rivers
Refinery has access to crude oil from foreign sources delivered to the Texas
Gulf Coast at Corpus Christi as well as crude oil from domestic sources through
third-party pipelines. A 70-mile pipeline that can deliver 120,000 BPD of
crude oil connects the Three Rivers Refinery to Corpus Christi. Valero
distributes refined products produced at this refinery primarily through
pipelines owned by Valero L.P.

Krotz Springs Refinery

. The Krotz Springs Refinery is located between Baton
Rouge and Lafayette, Louisiana on the Atchafalaya River. It generally
processes sweet crude oils (received primarily by pipeline and barge) into
conventional gasoline and distillates. The refinery’s location provides access
to upriver markets on the Mississippi River, and its docking facilities along
the Atchafalaya River are sufficiently deep to allow barge access. The
facility also uses the Colonial pipeline to transport products to markets in
the Southeast and Northeast.



WEST COAST

Valero’s West Coast refining region includes the Benicia Refinery and the
Wilmington Refinery. The following table presents the percentages of principal
feedstock charges and product yields (on a combined basis) for the two
refineries in this region for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Benicia Refinery

. The Benicia Refinery is located northeast of San Francisco
on the Carquinez Straits of San Francisco Bay. It is a highly complex refinery
that processes sour crude oils into a high percentage of premium products,
primarily CARB gasoline. The refinery can receive crude oil supplies via a
deepwater dock that can berth large crude oil carriers and a 20-inch crude oil
pipeline connected to a southern California crude oil delivery system. Most of
the refinery’s products are distributed via the Kinder Morgan pipeline in
California.

Wilmington Refinery

. The Wilmington Refinery is located near Los Angeles,
California. The refinery processes a blend of lower-cost heavy and high-sulfur
crude oils. The refinery can produce all of its gasoline as CARB gasoline.
The refinery is connected by pipeline to marine terminals and associated dock
facilities that can move and store crude oil and other feedstocks. Refined
products are distributed via a third-party pipeline and terminals in southern
California, Nevada and Arizona.



MID-CONTINENT

Valero’s Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee Refinery, the Ardmore
Refinery and the Denver Refinery. The following table presents the percentages
of principal feedstock charges and product yields (on a combined basis) for the

McKee Refinery

. The McKee Refinery is located in the Texas Panhandle. It
generally processes heavy sweet and sour crude oils into conventional gasoline,
RFG, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels and asphalt. The McKee Refinery has access
to crude oil from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado through Valero L.P.’s
pipelines and third-party pipelines. The refinery also has access at Wichita
Falls, Texas to third-party pipelines that transport crude oil from the Texas
Gulf Coast and West Texas to the Mid-Continent region. The refinery
distributes its products primarily via Valero L.P.’s pipelines to markets in
North Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma.

Ardmore Refinery

. The Ardmore Refinery is located in Ardmore, Oklahoma,
approximately 90 miles from Oklahoma City. It generally processes heavy sweet
and sour crude oils into conventional gasoline, low-sulfur diesel and asphalt.
Crude oil is delivered to the refinery through Valero L.P.’s crude oil
gathering and trunkline systems, third-party pipelines and trucking operations.
Refined products are transported via pipelines, railcars and trucks.

Denver Refinery

. The Denver Refinery is located outside Denver, Colorado. It
generally processes heavy sweet crude oils into conventional gasoline and
distillates. Crude oil for the refinery is supplied by a third-party pipeline
and by truck. The refinery benefits from a refined product pipeline that runs
from the McKee Refinery, which enhances flexibility of operations at both
refineries.



NORTHEAST

Valero’s Northeast refining region includes the Jean Gaulin Refinery in Quebec,
Canada and the Paulsboro Refinery in New Jersey. The following table presents
the percentages of principal feedstock charges and product yields (on a

Jean Gaulin Refinery

. The Jean Gaulin Refinery is located in Lévis, Canada
(near Quebec City). It generally processes lower-quality, light sweet acidic
crude oils and sour crude oils into conventional gasoline, low-sulfur diesel,
jet fuels, heating oil and propane. The refinery receives crude oil by ship at
its deepwater dock on the St. Lawrence River. Valero charters large
ice-strengthened, double-hulled crude oil tankers that can navigate the St.
Lawrence River year-round. The refinery’s production is transported primarily
by unit trains to markets in Quebec and New Brunswick, and by tankers and
trucks primarily to markets in Canada’s Atlantic Provinces.

Paulsboro Refinery

. The Paulsboro Refinery is located in Paulsboro, New
Jersey, approximately 15 miles south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River.
The refinery processes primarily sour crude oils into a wide slate of products
including gasoline, distillates, a variety of lube oil basestocks, asphalt and
fuel oil. Feedstocks and refined products are typically transported by tanker
and barge via refinery-owned dock facilities along the Delaware River, Exxon
Mobil Corporation’s product distribution system, an onsite truck rack, railcars
and the Colonial pipeline, which allows products to be sold into the New York
Harbor market.

FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY

Approximately 70% of Valero’s crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased
through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased
on the spot market. Valero’s term supply agreements include arrangements to
purchase feedstocks directly or indirectly from various foreign national oil
companies (including feedstocks originating in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq,
Kuwait, Venezuela, Ecuador and Africa) as well as international and domestic
oil companies at market-related prices. Approximately 80% of Valero’s crude
oil feedstocks are imported from foreign sources and approximately 20% are
domestic.

The U.S. network of crude oil pipelines and terminals (including those
facilities owned by Valero L.P.) allows Valero to acquire crude oil from
producing leases, domestic crude oil trading centers and ships delivering
cargoes of foreign and domestic crude oil. Access to the Valero L.P. network also allows Valero to
transport crude oil supplies to many of its U.S. refineries at a competitive
cost (compared to facilities that lack proprietary supply networks). Valero’s
Jean Gaulin Refinery relies on foreign crude oil that is delivered to its St.
Lawrence River dock facility by ship.



Valero’s cost to acquire feedstocks, and the price for which Valero ultimately
can sell refined products, depend on a number of factors beyond Valero’s
control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil,
gasoline, diesel and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn are
dependent upon, among other things, the availability of imports, the production
levels of domestic and foreign suppliers, U.S. relationships
with foreign governments, political affairs and the extent of governmental
regulation. Valero uses the futures market to manage the price risk inherent
in purchasing crude oil in advance of its delivery date and in maintaining
Valero’s inventories.

REFINING SEGMENT SALES

Valero’s refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the
wholesale rack and bulk markets. These sales include refined products that are
manufactured in Valero’s refining operations as well as refined products
purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of Valero’s
refineries have access to deepwater transportation facilities and interconnect
with common-carrier pipeline systems, allowing Valero to sell products in most
major geographic regions of the United States and eastern Canada. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of Valero’s total operating revenues in 2003.

Wholesale Marketing

Valero is a leading wholesale marketer of branded and unbranded transportation
fuels. Valero markets on a wholesale basis in about 40 U.S. states and Canada
primarily through an extensive rack marketing network. The principal
purchasers of Valero’s transportation fuels from terminal truck racks are
wholesalers, distributors, retailers and truck-delivered end users throughout
the United States.

The majority of Valero’s rack volumes are sold through unbranded channels. The
remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero
brand family. In the United States, these distributors and dealers operate
approximately 2,400 branded sites (representing currently branded sites and
sites under contract for branding with Valero). These sites are independently
owned and are supplied by Valero under multi-year contracts. Valero is
consolidating the number of brands used in its various markets. For wholesale
branded sites, Valero promotes its Valero

®

and Beacon

®

brands in California,
and its Valero

®

and Shamrock

®

brands on the U.S. east coast. In the
Mid-Continent and Southwest regions, Valero promotes its Diamond Shamrock

®

and
Shamrock

®

brands. Valero’s Canadian wholesale
operations use the Ultramar

®

brand.

Valero also sells a variety of other products produced at its refineries
including asphalt, lube base oils and commodity petrochemicals. These products
are transported via pipelines, barges, trucks and railcars.

In connection with the ability of Valero’s refineries to process significant
amounts of heavy sour crude oil, Valero produces approximately 60,000 BPD of
asphalt which is sold to customers in the paving and roofing industries.
Valero is the second largest producer of asphalt in the United States. Valero
produces asphalt at nine refineries and markets asphalt in 20 states through 13
terminal facilities.

Lubricant base oils and process oils are produced at Valero’s Paulsboro
Refinery. The refinery can produce 12,000 BPD of highly refined paraffinic
and aromatic oils for use in a variety of lubricant and process applications.
These products are sold to a variety of customers, including ExxonMobil under a
long-term agreement. ExxonMobil purchases about 50% of the Paulsboro
Refinery’s lubricant oil production with the balance sold to independent
blenders, additive manufacturers, and industrial and marine customers.



Valero produces and markets a variety of commodity petrochemicals including
aromatic solvents (benzene, toluene and xylene), refinery- and chemical-grade
propylene and anhydrous ammonia. Aromatic solvents and propylene are sold to
customers in the chemical industry for further processing into such products as
paints, plastics and adhesives. Ammonia, produced at Valero’s McKee Refinery,
is sold to customers in the agriculture industry to be used as fertilizer. Valero also sells petroleum coke and sulfur to domestic and international customers principally in the utility and agricultural sectors, respectively.

Product Supply and Trading

Valero sells a significant portion of its gasoline and distillate production
through bulk sales channels. Valero’s bulk sales are made to various oil
companies and traders as well as certain bulk end-users such as railroads,
airlines and utilities. Valero’s bulk sales are transported primarily by
pipeline, barges and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs.

Valero also enters into refined product exchange and purchase agreements.
These agreements enable Valero to minimize transportation costs, optimize
refinery utilization, balance refined product availability, broaden geographic
distribution and sell to markets not connected to Valero L.P.’s refined product
pipeline system. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined
products by Valero to unaffiliated companies at Valero’s and third parties’
terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to
Valero by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase
agreements involve Valero’s purchase of refined products from third parties
with delivery occurring at specified locations. Most of these agreements are
long-standing arrangements. However, they generally can be terminated with 30
to 90 days notice. Valero does not anticipate an interruption in its ability
to exchange or purchase refined products in the near future.

LOGISTICS

Through agreements with Valero L.P., Valero has access to a logistics system
that complements its refining and marketing business primarily in the U.S. Gulf
Coast, West Coast and Mid-Continent regions. Valero L.P. is a publicly traded
master limited partnership that, as of December 31, 2003, owned almost 800 miles of crude oil pipelines
(with related storage and batching facilities), approximately 3,800 miles of
refined product pipelines and a 25-mile hydrogen pipeline. Valero L.P. also
owned 19 refined product terminals with 166 tanks that have storage capacity of
approximately 4 million barrels, and it owned 58 crude oil and intermediate
feedstock storage tanks and related assets with a storage capacity of
approximately 11 million barrels. Valero assumed its ownership interest in
Valero L.P. (formerly known as “Shamrock Logistics, L.P.”) upon completion of
the UDS Acquisition. Valero owns approximately 46% of Valero L.P., which
includes its 2% general partner interest.

Valero L.P.’s refined product pipelines transport refined products from
Valero’s McKee, Three Rivers, Ardmore and Corpus Christi Refineries, directly
or indirectly, to markets in the Mid-Continent, Southwest and the Texas-Mexico
border region of the United States. In addition, Valero L.P.’s crude oil
pipelines and storage facilities supply Valero’s Corpus Christi West, Texas
City, McKee, Three Rivers, Ardmore and Benicia Refineries with crude oil and
other feedstocks and provide access to domestic and foreign crude oil sources.



RETAIL

Valero’s retail segment operations involve the sale of transportation fuels
at retail stores and unattended self-service cardlocks, the sale of convenience
store merchandise in retail stores, and the sale of home heating oil to
residential customers. Valero is one of the largest independent retailers of
refined products in the central and southwest United States, with strong brand
identification in an 11-state retail area, including Texas, California,
Colorado and Arizona, and in eastern Canada. Valero’s retail operations are
supported by Valero’s proprietary credit card program which had approximately
700,000 accounts as of December 31, 2003. Valero uses electronic point-of-sale
(POS) credit card processing at substantially all of its company- and
dealer-operated stores. Valero added satellite technology at selected
locations in 2003 to enhance its credit card processing. Valero’s retail
operations are segregated geographically into two groups: the U.S. System and
the Northeast System.

U.S. SYSTEM

Sales in the U.S. System represent sales of refined products and convenience
store merchandise through Valero’s company-operated retail sites. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, total sales of refined products through the U.S.
System’s retail sites averaged approximately 129,000 BPD. Valero has
approximately 1,150 company-operated sites in its U.S. System; of these sites,
about one-half are owned and one-half are leased. Company-operated stores are
operated under a variety of brand names including Corner Store

®

, Ultramart

®

and
Stop N Go

®

. Stores in Valero’s U.S. System sell gasoline and diesel fuel under
several brand names. In Valero’s California retail facilities, Valero promotes
its Valero

®

brand. In Valero’s Mid-Continent and Southwest retail facilities,
Valero promotes its Diamond Shamrock

®

brand.

Company-operated convenience stores sell, in addition to gasoline and diesel
fuels, a wide variety of immediately consumable products such as snacks, candy,
beer, fast foods, cigarettes and fountain drinks. Valero has an ongoing
program to modernize and upgrade the convenience stores it operates. These
efforts are focused primarily on improving the uniformity and appearance of
existing stores. Improvements generally include new exterior signage, lighting
and canopies, and pump and interior store upgrades. Valero continues to review
its retail network to identify appropriate markets for further investment and
to identify under-performing stores where future investment is deemed
non-strategic. In 2003, Valero re-imaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or
divested 122 stores.

NORTHEAST SYSTEM

Sales in Valero’s Northeast System represent sales of refined products and
convenience store merchandise through Valero’s company-operated retail sites
and cardlocks, sales of refined products through sites owned by independent
dealers and jobbers, and sales of home heating oil to residential customers.
Valero’s Northeast System includes retail operations in eastern Canada where
Valero is a major supplier of refined products serving Quebec, Ontario and the
Atlantic Provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island. For the year ended December 31, 2003, total retail sales of
refined products through the Northeast System averaged approximately 79,000
BPD. Gasoline and diesel fuel are sold under the Ultramar

®

brand through a
network of approximately 1,050 outlets throughout eastern Canada. As of
December 31, 2003, Valero owned or leased approximately 475 retail stores and
distributed gasoline to approximately 575 dealers and independent jobbers. In
addition, the Northeast System operates 86 cardlocks, which are card- or
key-activated, self-service, unattended stations that allow commercial,
trucking and governmental fleets to buy gasoline and diesel fuel 24 hours a
day.

The Northeast System operations also include a large home heating oil business.
Valero sells home heating oil under the Ultramar

®

brand to approximately
163,000 households in eastern Canada. Valero’s home heating oil business tends
to be seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during
the winter.



COMPETITION

The refining and marketing industry continues to be highly competitive.
Valero’s competitors include fully integrated major oil companies (

e.g.

,
ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips) and other independent refining and marketing
entities (

e.g.

, Sunoco and Premcor) that operate in all of Valero’s market
areas. Many of Valero’s competitors are engaged on a national or international
basis in many segments of the petroleum business, including exploration,
production, transportation, refining and marketing, on scales much larger than
Valero’s. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or
absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these segments. All of
Valero’s crude oil and feedstock supplies are purchased from third-party
sources, while some competitors have proprietary sources of crude oil available
for their own refineries.

Financial returns in the refining and marketing industry depend largely on
refining margins and retail fuel margins, both of which fluctuate
significantly. Refining margins are impacted by levels of refined product
inventories, the balance of refined product supply and demand, quantities of
refined product imports, and utilization rates of domestic refineries.
Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to
continue to be volatile in the future. Valero’s ability to process significant
amounts of sour crude oils enhances Valero’s competitive position in the
industry as sour crude oils typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet
crude oils.

Valero’s retail business faces competition from fully integrated major oil
companies that have increased their efforts to capture retail market share in
recent years. Valero also competes with large grocery stores and other
merchandisers (the so-called “hypermarts”) that often sell gasoline at
aggressively competitive prices in order to attract customers to their sites.
In Quebec, Canada and in the adjacent Atlantic Provinces, Valero is the largest
independent retailer of gasoline.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The principal environmental risks associated with Valero’s operations are
emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water or
groundwater. Valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and numerous federal, state and
local authorities under extensive federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into
the environment, waste management, pollution prevention and characteristics and
compositions of fuels. The significant federal laws applicable to Valero’s
operations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA). A discussion of significant environmental regulations affecting
Valero’s operations follows.

EPA’s “Tier II” Gasoline and Diesel Standards

. The EPA’s Tier II standards,
adopted under the Clean Air Act, phase in limitations on the sulfur content of
gasoline beginning in 2004 and the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold to
highway consumers beginning in 2006. Modifications will be required at most of
Valero’s refineries as a result of the Tier II gasoline and diesel standards.
Valero believes that capital expenditures of approximately $1.5
billion will be required through 2006 for Valero to meet the new Tier II
specifications, of which approximately $500 million was expended by the end of
2003. The aggregate estimate of expenditures includes amounts related to
projects at two Valero refineries to improve refinery yield and octane balance
and to provide hydrogen as part of the process of removing sulfur from gasoline
and diesel. Valero expects that such estimates will change as additional
engineering is completed and progress is made toward construction of these
various projects. Factors that will affect the impact of these regulations on
Valero include its ultimate selection of specific technologies to meet the Tier
II standards and uncertainties related to timing, permitting and construction
of specific units. Valero expects to meet all Tier II gasoline and diesel
standards by their respective effective dates.



EPA’s Section 114 Initiative.

In 2000, the EPA issued to a majority of
refiners operating in the United States a series of information requests
pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act as part of an enforcement
initiative. Valero received a Section 114 information request pertaining to
all of its refineries owned at that time. Valero has completed its response to
the request. Several other refiners have reached settlements with the EPA
regarding this enforcement initiative. Though Valero has not been named in any
proceeding, it also has been discussing the possibility of settlement with the
EPA regarding this initiative. Based in part upon announced settlements and
evaluation of its relative position, Valero expects to incur penalties and
related expenses in connection with a potential settlement of this enforcement
initiative. Valero believes that any potential settlement penalties will be
immaterial to its results of operations and financial position. However,
Valero believes that any potential settlement with the EPA in this matter will
require various capital improvements or changes in operating parameters, or
both, at some or all of its refineries which could be material in the
aggregate.

Houston/Galveston SIP

. Valero’s Houston and Texas City Refineries are located
in the Houston/Galveston area, which is classified as “severe nonattainment”
for compliance with EPA air-quality standards for ozone. In October 2001, the
EPA approved a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to bring the Houston/Galveston
area into compliance with the EPA’s ozone standards by 2007. The EPA-approved
plan was based on a requirement for industry sources to reduce emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 90% from a 1997-1999 average actual emissions
baseline. Certain industry and business groups challenged the plan based on
technical feasibility of the 90% NOx control and its effectiveness in meeting
the ozone standard. In December 2002, the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) adopted a revised approach for the Houston/Galveston SIP. This
alternative plan requires an 80% reduction in NOx emissions and a 64% reduction
in so-called highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC). This
alternative plan is subject to EPA scrutiny and approval. Valero’s Texas City
and Houston Refineries will be required to install NOx and HRVOC control and
monitoring equipment and practices by 2007, at a cost estimated by Valero to be
approximately $60 million based on the proposed TCEQ approach.

MTBE Restrictions.

The presence of MTBE in some water supplies in California
and other states, resulting from gasoline leaks primarily from underground
storage tanks, has led to public concern that MTBE poses a possible health
risk. As a result of heightened public concern, California banned the use of
MTBE as a gasoline component in California beginning January 1, 2004, and the
California Air Resources Board’s specifications for CARB Phase III gasoline
became effective on that date. Valero’s costs to permit and modify its
California refineries to comply with CARB Phase III gasoline specifications and
eliminate MTBE as a gasoline component were approximately $60 million. Other
states and the EPA also have either passed or proposed or are considering
proposals to restrict or ban the use of MTBE. If MTBE were to be restricted or
banned throughout the United States, Valero believes that it can modify its
remaining non-California MTBE-producing facilities to produce other octane
enhancing products for an immaterial capital investment.

Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental Regulations

.
In 2003, Valero’s capital expenditures attributable to compliance with
environmental regulations were approximately $540 million, and are currently
estimated to be approximately $625 million for 2004 and approximately $770
million for 2005. These estimates for 2004 and 2005 do not include amounts
related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures
relating to compliance with environmental regulations is not determinable.



Governmental regulations are complex, are subject to different interpretations
and are becoming increasingly more stringent. Therefore, future legislative
action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits,
additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating
costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition,
because certain air emissions at Valero’s refineries have been grandfathered
under particular environmental laws, any major upgrades at any of its
refineries could require potentially material additional expenditures to comply
with environmental laws and regulations.

EMPLOYEES

As of February 29, 2004, Valero had 19,621 employees, including salaried and
hourly employees, of which 16,136 were employed in the United States and 3,485
were employed in Canada.

PROPERTIES

Valero’s principal properties are described above under the caption “Valero’s
Operations.” In addition, Valero owns feedstock and refined product storage
facilities in various locations. Valero believes that its properties and
facilities are generally adequate for its operations and that its facilities
are maintained in a good state of repair. As of December 31, 2003, Valero was
the lessee under a number of cancelable and non-cancelable leases for certain
properties, including the Benicia Refinery dock facility, office facilities,
retail facilities, transportation equipment and various assets used to store,
transport and produce refinery feedstocks and/or refined products. Valero’s
leases are discussed more fully in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. In addition, see Part II of this report under the heading
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” under the caption “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion
of Valero’s purchase of certain leased properties in March 2004.

Valero’s patents relating to its refining operations are not material to Valero
as a whole. The trademarks and tradenames under which Valero conducts its
retail and branded wholesale business – specifically Diamond Shamrock

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Unocal

Union Oil Company of California v. Valero Energy Corporation

, United States
District Court, Central District of California (filed January 22, 2002). In
2002, Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) sued Valero alleging patent
infringement. The complaint seeks a 5.75 cent per gallon royalty on all
reformulated gasoline infringing on Unocal’s '393 and '126 patents. These
patents cover certain compositions of cleaner-burning gasoline. The complaint
seeks treble damages for Valero’s alleged willful infringement of Unocal’s
patents and Valero’s alleged conduct to induce others to infringe the patents.
In a previous lawsuit involving its '393 patent, Unocal prevailed against five
other major refiners.

In 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began an antitrust investigation
concerning Unocal’s misconduct with a joint industry research group and
regulators during the time that Unocal was prosecuting its patents at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). In 2003, the FTC filed a complaint against
Unocal for antitrust violations. The FTC’s complaint seeks an injunction
against any future '393 or '126 patent enforcement activity by Unocal. In
November 2003, an administrative law judge dismissed the FTC’s case against
Unocal, which the FTC staff appealed to the full Commission. Oral argument for
that appeal occurred on March 10, 2004.

Each of the '393 and '126 patents is being reexamined by the PTO. The PTO has
issued notices of rejection of all claims of each of these patents. These
rejections are subject to additional proceedings, including administrative
appeal by Unocal, followed by an appeal in federal district court or the court
of appeals. Ultimate invalidation would preclude Unocal from pursuing claims
based on the '393 or '126 patents.

Unocal’s patent lawsuit against Valero is indefinitely stayed as a result of
the PTO reexamination proceedings. Notwithstanding the judgment against the
other refiners in the previous litigation, Valero believes that it has several
strong defenses to Unocal’s lawsuit, including those arising from Unocal’s
misconduct, and Valero believes it will prevail in the lawsuit. However, due
to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is reasonably possible that
Valero will not prevail in the lawsuit, and an adverse result could have a
material adverse effect on Valero’s results of operations and financial
position.

MTBE Litigation

Valero is a defendant in more than 50 cases pending in at least 15 states
alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water
providers, governmental authorities and private well owners alleging that
refiners and suppliers of gasoline containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing
or distributing a defective product. Almost all of these cases have been filed
since September 30, 2003 in anticipation of a pending federal energy bill that
may contain provisions for MTBE liability protection. Valero is named in these
suits together with many other refining industry companies. Valero is being
sued primarily as a refiner, supplier and marketer of gasoline containing MTBE.
Valero does not own or operate physical facilities in most of the states where
the suits are filed. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified
compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. Valero believes that it
has several strong defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously defend
the lawsuits. Exhibit 99.02 to this report contains a list of the MTBE suits
in which Valero has been served or has been furnished a copy of the petition.
Although an adverse result in one or more of these suits is reasonably possible
(as defined in FASB Statement No. 5), Valero believes that such an outcome in
any one of these suits would not have a material adverse effect on its results
of operations or financial position. However, Valero believes that an adverse
result in all or a substantial number of these cases could have a material
adverse effect on Valero’s results of operations and financial position.



Environmental Proceedings

United States Environmental Protection Agency Region II, In the Matter of:
Mobil Oil Corporation, Notice of Violation CAA-02-2001-1305

(May 15, 2001)
(Paulsboro Refinery). The EPA issued notices of violation (NOVs) relating to
Mobil Oil Corporation’s operation of the Paulsboro Refinery prior to Valero’s
ownership of the refinery. Valero purchased the refinery from Mobil in 1998.
The NOVs allege that Mobil performed certain actions on the refinery’s fluid
catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) without satisfying certain permitting and other
requirements under the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act.
Mobil tendered the NOVs to Valero for indemnification under the refinery
purchase agreement between Mobil and Valero. Valero has assumed the defense of
these NOVs. The EPA has not asserted a specific demand for administrative or
civil penalties or equitable relief under the NOVs, but potential penalties
under the NOVs could exceed $100,000. Valero believes that it has various
legal and equitable defenses in support of its position that no material
liability should be borne by Valero with respect to these NOVs.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)

(Benicia Refinery). Valero
received 60 violation notices (VNs) from April 2002 through
March 4, 2004 from
the BAAQMD for incidents at Valero’s Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant.
Forty of the VNs relate to alleged excess emissions from fugitive leaks,
fire, process upset or instrument malfunction. Twelve VNs were issued for
alleged visible emissions resulting from power failure, operational upset or
instrument malfunction. Three VNs were for alleged public nuisances resulting
from fire, power failure or release. The remaining five VNs relate to alleged
recordkeeping discrepancies for late reporting or failure to meet a permit
condition, or odor associated with a process upset. No penalties have been
assessed for the violations. Valero is negotiating with the BAAQMD to resolve

all of these matters. Valero expects to settle all 58 VNs for an amount
immaterial to Valero, but in excess of $100,000.

City of Houston Bureau of Air Quality Control (HBAQC), et al. (Houston
Refinery).

The HBAQC, the Harris County Pollution Control District (HCPCD) and
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued 21 violations from
February 2002 to November 2003 to the Houston refinery for various alleged
noncompliance issues. The HBAQC issued 17 violations for alleged incidents
related to or resulting from excess emissions. Two violations were issued by
the HCPCD for an alleged emissions event and unauthorized wastewater discharge.
The TCEQ issued two violations for excess emissions and failure to
monitor/report upset emissions. No penalties have been assessed for the
violations, except for two HBAQC violations that state proposed penalties of
$8,750 each. Valero is negotiating with the agencies to resolve these
violations. Valero expects to settle all 21 violations for an amount
immaterial to Valero, but in excess of $100,000.

New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)

(Paulsboro Refinery).
Valero has received 27 NJDEP Administrative Orders and Notices of Civil
Administrative Penalty Assessments (Orders) from February 2002 through January
2004 for alleged incidents at Valero’s Paulsboro Refinery. Thirteen of the
Orders relate to excess emissions, for which the NJDEP has proposed penalties
totaling $207,950. Eight of the Orders relate to failure to repair fugitive
leaks or tank seals, for which penalties of $408,800 are proposed. Two Orders
are for alleged hazardous waste discharges (proposed penalties of $15,000), two
are for alleged Title V permit deviations (proposed penalties of $36,000), and
two are for alleged failures to operate according to approved plans or permit
conditions (proposed penalties of $7,000). Valero is currently negotiating a
settlement with the NJDEP and expects to settle all 27 Orders for an amount
immaterial to Valero, but in excess of $100,000.

New Mexico Environment Department

(Tucumcari terminal). Valero received a
revised notice of violation on June 15, 2003 from the New Mexico Environment
Department (NMED) concerning an alleged violation of Title V of the Clean Air
Act at Valero L.P.’s refined products terminal in Tucumcari, New Mexico. NMED
alleges that the terminal operated as a Title V source from December 14, 1994
through September 6, 1998,



and that the terminal failed to apply for a Title V permit during that time period.
In January 2004, NMED further revised the notice of violation assessing a
penalty of $312,120. Valero is currently negotiating a settlement with the
NMED and expects to settle this matter for an amount immaterial to Valero, but
in excess of $100,000. Because this matter relates to a period prior to Valero
L.P.’s ownership of the Tucumcari terminal, Valero will remain responsible for
any costs related to resolution of the matter.

Proposition 65 Litigation. McAdam, on behalf of the general public, and
Communities for a Better Environment, a California non-profit organization v.
Tosco Corporation, Ultramar Inc., et al.

, Superior Court of the State of
California for the County of San Francisco, Case No. 300595 (filed January 19,
1999). Communities for a Better Environment (CBE) is a non-profit organization
that brought this lawsuit under California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic
Enforcement Act of 1986, also known as California Proposition 65. Any
individual acting in the public interest may enforce Proposition 65 by filing a
lawsuit against a business alleged to be in violation of this law. CBE has
sued several energy companies, including Valero, alleging violations of the
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 at several sites in
California, including alleged releases of benzene and toluene into groundwater.
Thirty-three Valero sites are named in this proceeding. Plaintiffs seek,
among other things, unquantified property damages, remediation, installation of
monitoring equipment and attorneys’ fees. Valero is negotiating with the
plaintiffs to settle this matter based on settlement criteria offered by the
plaintiffs and the settlement provisions of other defendants. Valero expects
to settle this matter for an amount immaterial to Valero, but in excess of
$100,000.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)

(Texas City Refinery). Valero
received a notice of enforcement dated July 18, 2003 from the TCEQ relating to
its wastewater treatment facility at the Texas City Refinery. The notice
alleged noncompliance with certain effluent limitations and monitoring
requirements in 2002, and assessed an administrative penalty of $146,850 (the
amount last reported in Valero’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2003). Valero settled the NOE in January 2004 for $75,150.

Other Litigation

Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final
outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the range of
any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision and
Valero cannot provide assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or
proceeding would not have an adverse effect on its results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of 2003.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following review of the results of operations and financial condition of
Valero should be read in conjunction with Items 1 & 2, “Business & Properties”
and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this
report. In the discussions that follow, all per-share amounts assume dilution.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Form 10-K, including without limitation the discussion below under the
heading “Results of Operations - Outlook,” contains certain estimates,
predictions, projections, assumptions and other “forward-looking statements”
(as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and uncertainties.
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are
based, are made in good faith and reflect Valero’s current judgment regarding
the direction of its business, actual results will almost always vary,
sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions
or other future performance suggested in this report. These forward-looking
statements can generally be identified by the words “anticipate,” “believe,”
“expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,”
“will,” “could,” “should,” “may” and similar expressions. These
forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:

Valero’s forward-looking statements are based on its beliefs and assumptions
derived from information available at the time the statements are made.
Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in
these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors,
including the following:



Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially
affect Valero’s future results of operations and whether any forward-looking
statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Valero’s forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and
future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any
forward-looking statements. Valero does not intend to update these statements
unless it is required by the securities laws to do so.

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
Valero or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the foregoing. Valero undertakes no obligation to publicly release
the result of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be
made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.



Overview

As of December 31, 2003, Valero owned and operated 14 refineries in the United
States and Canada with a combined throughput capacity, including crude oil and
other feedstocks, of approximately 2.1 million barrels per day. Valero markets
refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a
network of more than 4,500 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States and eastern
Canada. Valero’s operations are affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and
refinery maintenance turnarounds,

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products, and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the absolute price of
crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry
supply capacity and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds.

Valero’s profitability is determined in large part by the spread between the
price of refined products and the price of crude oil, or the refined product
margin. Additionally, since almost 50% of Valero’s throughput represents sour
crude oil feedstocks, Valero’s profitability is also significantly affected by
the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as
the sour crude oil discount. During 2003, both refined product margins and
sour crude oil discounts improved significantly from 2002 levels. Due to
various factors, including strong refined product demand in both domestic and
foreign markets and an anticipated reduction in supply attributable to various
factors, including the ban on MTBE in certain areas of the United States and
implementation of the new clean-fuel Tier II regulations, Valero believes that
the outlook for both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts is
favorable.

The positive 2003 results from Valero’s operations, as well as certain
investing and financing activities during 2003, are expected to favorably
position Valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return,
continued growth and improved earnings stability.

During 2003, Valero reduced its debt by approximately $726 million, resulting
in a decrease in its debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) from
approximately 50% at December 31, 2002 to approximately 40% at the end of 2003.
During 2003, Valero’s debt and debt-to-capitalization ratio were positively
impacted by the following:

•

the generation of $1.8 billion of cash from operating activities;

•

the ceasing of consolidation of Valero L.P., which removed Valero
L.P.’s debt from Valero’s consolidated balance sheet, and the receipt
of $380 million of proceeds resulting from the subsequent contribution
and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P.;

•

the issuance of 6.3 million shares of Valero common stock, the
proceeds of which were used for repayments of borrowings under Valero’s
revolving bank credit facilities; and

•

the issuance of 4.9 million shares of Valero common stock resulting
from the settlement of purchase contracts associated with the $172.5
million of Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units).

In addition during 2003, Valero continued its strategic growth through the
acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and the start-up of a 45,000
barrel-per-day coker unit at the Texas City Refinery. The St. Charles Refinery
operated at 95% of capacity, averaging almost 200,000 barrels per day of
throughput, since Valero acquired it on July 1, 2003. The St. Charles Refinery
contributed approximately $39 million to Valero’s operating income for the last
six months of 2003. The 45,000 barrel-per-day coker unit at the Texas City
Refinery began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will enable the
refinery to process heavier, lower-cost crude oil. The ability to process the
lower-cost crude oil is expected to significantly lower the refinery’s average
feedstock costs. Going forward, the St. Charles Acquisition and the start-up
of the coker unit at the Texas City Refinery are expected to further enable
Valero to benefit from wider sour crude oil discounts that Valero believes will
occur. Valero believes that it has significantly improved its feedstock
flexibility and leverage to benefit from an expected continuation of good
refining industry fundamentals.

General

Valero’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $621.5 million, or
$5.09 per share, compared to $91.5 million, or $0.83 per share, for the year
ended December 31, 2002. For the fourth quarter of 2003, Valero’s net income
was $131.6 million, or $1.01 per share, compared to $89.0 million, or $0.81 per
share, for the fourth quarter of 2002.



Operating revenues increased 31% from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the
year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of higher refined product
prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations.
The increase in operating income from $470.9 million for 2002 to $1.2 billion
for 2003 was attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valero’s
refining segment as discussed below.

Refining

Operating income for Valero’s refining segment was $1.4 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $744.8 million from the year ended
December 31, 2002. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted
primarily from a 28% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and a
15% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses.

Refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following
factors:

•

Gasoline and distillate margins improved significantly during 2003
compared to 2002 due to strong demand and lower inventory levels.
Demand for distillates improved significantly in 2003 due to colder
winter weather in the Northeast and fuel switching demand in early 2003
caused by high natural gas prices. Refined product inventories were
lower than the inventory levels that existed during most of 2002 due to
the stronger demand combined with lower refinery production rates
resulting from a large number of maintenance turnarounds in the
refining industry in the first quarter of 2003 and the continuing
impact of the oil workers’ strike in Venezuela in early 2003, which
also reduced production rates. The high inventory levels in 2002 were
caused by weaker economic conditions, an unusually warm winter in the
northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet
fuel demand.

•

Discounts on Valero’s sour crude oil feedstocks increased for the
year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31,
2002 due mainly to the resumption of higher crude oil production rates
by OPEC.

•

Valero’s throughput volumes for 2003 increased from 2002 due to
incremental volumes from the St. Charles Refinery commencing in July
2003 and increased refinery utilization rates during 2003, as eight of
Valero’s refineries were affected by turnaround activities during 2002.
Also during 2002, production at several refineries was reduced at
various times during the year due to uneconomic operating conditions.

The above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the
effects of:

•

a net benefit of approximately $76 million in 2002 resulting from
the settlement of petroleum products purchase agreements and related
hedges,

•

a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of Valero’s
LIFO inventories in 2002,

•

approximately $62 million resulting from Valero ceasing
consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, and

•

an increase in unplanned downtime during 2003 at certain of
Valero’s refineries.

Refining operating expenses were 24% higher for the year ended December 31,
2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to the
acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003, higher energy costs
(primarily related to natural gas), an increase in employee compensation
expense including increased variable compensation, and increased maintenance
expense associated with unplanned downtime. However, the increase in refining
operating expenses on a per barrel basis was only 8% from 2002 to 2003 due to
an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above. Refining
depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% from the year ended December
31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense
related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and increased turnaround
and catalyst amortization.



Retail

Retail operating income was $211.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, an increase of $83.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 as a
result of higher retail fuel margins in both the U.S. and Northeast retail
systems and operational improvements. During 2003, Valero continued to
implement its U.S. retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in
certain key stores and disposing of certain underperforming or non-strategic
stores. During 2003, Valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or
divested 122 stores. These changes contributed to improved operating income
for the retail segment in 2003.

Corporate Expenses and Other

Administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense,
increased $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2002. Part of the increase was due to the recognition
of increased variable compensation expense of approximately $21 million in 2003
as a result of improved financial performance in 2003 as compared to 2002.
Also, in December 2003, a $25.8 million impairment charge was recognized and
reflected in administrative depreciation and amortization expense to write down
the carrying value of Valero’s current headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs, as described further in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily
to increases in salary and benefits expenses, ad valorem taxes and litigation
costs.

Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valero’s equity interest in the
earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, Valero’s
ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result
of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other
partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of
that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in
Valero L.P. Valero’s ownership interest in Valero L.P. has been further
reduced to 45.7% as of December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of the issuance
of additional common units by Valero L.P. in April and August 2003. Prior to
March 18, 2003, Valero consolidated the operations of Valero L.P. The minority
interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders’
share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero
consolidated such operations.

The increase in other income, net from 2002 to 2003 is due mainly to a gain of
$17.0 million related to the sale of notes receivable from Tesoro Refining and
Marketing Company (Tesoro) in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle
Refinery and related assets in 2002. This gain was offset by a $7.1 million
decrease in equity income from joint ventures and the initial recognition of an
asset retirement obligation of $4.2 million.

Net interest expense decreased $24.4 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to
a decrease in debt levels from $5 billion as of December 31, 2002 to $4.2
billion as of December 31, 2003 and an increase in capitalized interest
attributable to a larger capital investment program.

Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased $13.2
million from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31,
2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities
(TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the PEPS Units in August 2003.

Income tax expense increased from $58.2 million in 2002 to $365.1 million in
2003 due to the significant increase in pre-tax income.

Valero utilizes the financial measure of earnings before interest, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which is not defined under
United States generally accepted accounting principles. Management presents
EBITDA in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its press
releases. Management uses this financial measure because it is a widely
accepted financial indicator used by some investors and analysts to analyze and
compare companies on the basis of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA
is used in the computation of certain debt covenant ratios included in Valero’s
various debt agreements. EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for
the period, nor is it presented as an alternative to operating income or income
before income taxes. It should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles. Valero’s method of

The following notes relate to references on pages 35 through 38.

General

Valero’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $91.5 million, or
$0.83 per share, compared to net income of $563.6 million, or $8.83 per share,
for the year ended December 31, 2001.



Operating revenues increased 94% for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a
result of the additional throughput volumes from the refinery operations
acquired in the UDS, El Paso and Huntway Acquisitions and the additional
revenues generated from the retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition,
partially offset by a decline in refined product prices. However, operating
income for 2002 declined $530.5 million, or 53%, from the $1.0 billion reported
in 2001 due mainly to a $542.1 million decrease in operating income from the
refining segment and a $115.0 million increase in administrative expenses
(including related depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by
an increase of $126.6 million in operating income from the retail segment
attributable to the retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition.

Operating income for 2002 benefited from synergies that were created as a
result of the merger between Valero and UDS. Synergies of the combined company
resulted in both gross margin improvements and reductions in operating and
administrative expenses. The gross margin synergies related primarily to a
reduction in inventory levels, yield optimization and operational initiatives.
Operating and administrative expense synergies were achieved mainly from
incorporating best practices between the two companies’ procurement and energy
contract initiatives and eliminating salaries and benefits associated with
former UDS executives and other employees.

Refining

Operating income for Valero’s refining segment declined from $1.2 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $618.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The decrease in refining segment operating income was due
principally to a 34% decline in the throughput margin per barrel attributable
to depressed sour crude oil discounts and lower refined product margins in all
of Valero’s markets.

During 2002, refining total throughput margin was negatively impacted by the
following factors:

•

discounts on Valero’s sour crude oil feedstocks during 2002
declined approximately 50% from 2001 levels primarily due to OPEC’s
crude oil production cuts in 2002, which limited the availability of
sour crude oil on the world market, whereas 2001 benefited from
increased supplies of sour crude oil while demand for sweeter crude oil
increased to meet lower sulfur requirements for certain refined
products;

•

gasoline and distillate margins declined significantly from 2001 to
2002 due to high inventory levels for these products as a result of an
increase in gasoline imports, increased gasoline production
(particularly in California), an unusually warm winter in the
northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet
fuel demand. Although gasoline demand increased during the year, high
imports of gasoline kept inventories at above-normal levels; and

•

Valero’s refinery utilization rates were significantly below its
normal operating rates during 2002 as eight of Valero’s refineries were
affected by turnaround activities. In addition to the scheduled
downtime, Valero also experienced significant unplanned maintenance at
its refineries during 2002, and production at most of its refineries
was reduced at various times during the year due to uneconomic
operating conditions.

The above decreases in refining throughput margin were partially offset by the
increased throughput volumes resulting from the UDS, Huntway and El Paso
Acquisitions, a net benefit of approximately $76 million resulting from the
settlement in June and August 2002 of petroleum products purchase agreements
and related hedges, and a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain
of its LIFO inventories.

Refining operating expenses and refining depreciation and amortization expense
were 57% and 70% higher, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of the additional
refinery operations from the UDS, El Paso and Huntway Acquisitions. However,
these operating costs on a per barrel basis remained stable from 2001 to 2002
as a result of the additional throughput volumes from these acquisitions.



Retail

Retail operating income was $128.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2002 retail
operating income includes both the U.S. and Northeast retail operations
acquired in the UDS Acquisition. The 2001 retail operations included only 11
northern California retail stores operated by Valero at that time.

During 2002, pursuant to a plan adopted in conjunction with the UDS
Acquisition, Valero implemented various changes in its retail operations that
benefited results in 2002 and are expected to continue to benefit future
results for the retail segment. As part of these changes, 76 stores were
reimaged and upgraded in 2002. These changes also included the closure or
divestiture of approximately 160 stores and the identification of an additional
150 stores for closure or divestiture. Gains or losses on divested stores are
recognized to the extent of the difference between any net proceeds received on
disposition and the net book value of each store.

Retail selling expenses and retail depreciation and amortization expense for
the year ended December 31, 2002 were significantly higher than 2001 due to the
additional retail stores acquired in the UDS Acquisition.

Corporate Expenses and Other

Administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense,
increased $115.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was due primarily to additional
administrative expenses resulting from the UDS Acquisition and increases in
employee salaries and benefits and professional services, partially offset by
reduced variable compensation expense as a result of the lower level of
operating income recognized during 2002 and the nonrecurrence in 2002 of
integration and early retirement costs incurred in 2001 in connection with the
UDS Acquisition.

Other income (expense), net increased $13.2 million from expense of $4.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to income of $8.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to a $7.0 million increase in equity
income from Valero’s investments in joint ventures and $5.9 million of interest
income related to the amortization of the discount on the notes receivable from
Tesoro in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business.

Net interest and debt expense increased $197.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase
was due primarily to interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance the UDS
Acquisition coupled with interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the
UDS Acquisition, as well as the full-year effect of interest expense on the
capital lease obligations associated with the June 1, 2001 El Paso Acquisition.

The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represents the minority
unitholders’ share of the net income of Valero L.P.

Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts increased to $30.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $13.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 due to the distributions incurred on the $200 million
TOPrS assumed in the UDS Acquisition.

Income tax expense decreased $273.1 million from 2001 to 2002 mainly as a
result of lower operating income and higher interest expense.

OUTLOOK

During January and February 2004, refining industry fundamentals continued to
improve, resulting in both higher refined product margins and wider sour crude
oil discounts than those realized in the fourth quarter of 2003. In regard to
refined products, distillate demand has been strong primarily due to the cold
weather in the Northeast, which has helped support heating oil margins at
attractive levels. Gasoline margins have also increased since the end of 2003
as a result of strong demand resulting from improved economies in both the
United States and Asia. In addition, gasoline margins have benefited from
reduced imports attributable in part to the impact of the new lower sulfur
specifications for gasoline that became effective January 1, 2004 and the
effect of the removal of MTBE from gasoline in several states. Refined product
supplies are expected to be further impacted in the short term as a high level
of industry-wide turnaround activity is anticipated during the first quarter of
2004. Valero expects these factors to continue to support strong gasoline
margins as summer approaches.

In addition to the favorable outlook for refined product margins, sour crude
oil discounts have widened significantly from the fourth quarter of 2003 and
are expected to continue to benefit from various factors. These factors
include an expected increase in sour crude oil supplies on world markets,
partly due to certain refiners processing more sweet crude oil and less sour
crude oil as a result of the new lower sulfur specifications. Also, the
favorable economic environment anticipated for 2004 should result in the
production of more sour crude oil to satisfy expected higher refined product
demand, which should also contribute to wide sour crude oil discounts. The
significant turnaround activity is also projected to positively impact sour
crude oil discounts since a significant amount of the reduced capacity
resulting from these turnarounds is sour crude oil processing capacity.

Operationally, Valero expects to benefit during 2004 from the full-year effect
of the St. Charles Refinery that was acquired in July 2003 and from an
expansion of that facility’s crude and coker units in March 2004. Valero also
expects to benefit throughout 2004 from a new 45,000 barrel-per-day coker unit
at the Texas City Refinery that began operations late in the fourth quarter of
2003. In addition, Valero’s acquisition of the Aruba Refinery in March 2004 is
expected to be accretive to Valero’s earnings for 2004 and beyond. The Aruba
Refinery processes heavy, sour crude oil, primarily Mayan crude oil, and
therefore complements Valero’s strategy of processing heavy, sour crude oil
that generally sells at a discount to sweet crude oil.



As a result of these factors, Valero believes it is well-positioned to
capitalize during 2004 on the expected positive industry fundamentals and the
resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil
discounts.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003
was $1.8 billion compared to $272.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating
activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the significant increase in
income in 2003 as described above under “Results of Operations” and changes in
cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further
described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
primary cause of the change in working capital between the years related to
changes in the amount of receivables sold under Valero’s accounts receivable
sales programs. During 2003, the amount of receivables sold under the program
increased by $350 million, while during 2002, working capital was unfavorably
impacted by a $123 million decrease in the amount of receivables sold. For the
year ended December 31, 2003, in addition to the $350.0 million increase in the
amount of receivables sold, changes in working capital included a $415.8
million increase in accounts payable, which more than offset a $270.0 million
increase in inventories. Inventories increased due to higher volumes of
feedstock and refined product inventories on hand at December 31, 2003
attributable primarily to (i) lower than normal feedstock levels at December
31, 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers’ strike in Venezuela and
(ii) increased refinery utilization rates during 2003.

In addition to the $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities,
Valero generated cash from various other sources during 2003, including
proceeds of approximately $300 million from the issuance of senior notes in
June, $250.3 million from the issuance of common stock in March, $379.9 million
from the contribution and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P., $89.6 million
from the sale of Tesoro notes held by Valero, and $94.2 million from the
disposition of certain parts of its home heating oil business and other
property, plant and equipment. Valero used these proceeds to:

The remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under Valero’s
committed and uncommitted bank credit facilities.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $272.3 million compared to $905.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2001, a decrease of $633.2 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating
activities from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the unfavorable change in
income as described above under “Results of Operations” and an $80.1 million
increase in the amount of cash used to fund working capital and deferred
charges and credits. Changes in working capital for the year ended December
31, 2002 included:



•

a significant increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable
resulting from increased commodity prices from December 31, 2001 to
December 31, 2002;

•

an increase in receivables of approximately $123 million due to a
reduction in the amount of receivables sold under Valero’s accounts
receivable sales facility;

•

the receipt of approximately $141 million of income tax refunds,
net of payments; and

•

a decrease in accrued expenses as a result of payments for
change-in-control benefits to former UDS employees and a decrease in
employee bonuses.

Valero’s investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 provided net
cash of $248.6 million. Valero’s investing activities included the receipt of
$300.9 million from the liquidation of its investment in the Diamond-Koch joint
venture and $925.0 million from the sale of the Golden Eagle Business,
partially offset by payments of $803.4 million for capital expenditures,
deferred turnaround and catalyst costs and earn-out payments and net cash
requirements related to the Golden Eagle Business of $183.5 million.

During 2002, operating and investing activities provided $520.9 million of
cash, which was used primarily to reduce Valero’s debt by $412.9 million with a
resulting increase of $109.5 million in Valero’s cash balance.

Capital Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2003, Valero expended $1.1 billion for
capital investments of which $975.8 million related to capital expenditures
(including approximately $540 million for environmental projects) and $136.4
million related to deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures
for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $438 million to fund construction
of gasoline desulfurization units at the Texas City, Paulsboro, Quebec and
Corpus Christi West Refineries in response to Tier II sulfur regulations. The
capital expenditure amount above excludes $134 million and $55 million,
respectively, related to a coker facility at the Texas City Refinery and the
expansion of the former UDS headquarters facility, which will be Valero’s new
corporate headquarters, both of which were being funded through structured
lease arrangements



through
December 31, 2003 (see the discussion below in

“Structured Lease
Arrangements”

under

“Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements”

and in Note 23 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition to the $1.1 billion of capital
investments discussed above, $275.0 million was expended for the purchase of
certain convenience stores and Valero’s current headquarters buildings, which
were previously subject to structured lease arrangements (see the discussion in
Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $106.1 million was
invested in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $50.6 million of payments
were made related to the earn-out contingency agreements discussed below and
$344 million of cash was expended for strategic acquisitions.

In connection with Valero’s acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997, the
Paulsboro Refinery in 1998, and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers
are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years, five years and seven
years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining
margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion
in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Any payments due
under these earn-out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate
limits. During 2003, Valero made earn-out contingency payments of $35.0
million related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc. and $15.6 million
related to the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery. No future earn-out
payments related to the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery will be due as
the term of that earn-out arrangement expired in September 2003. Based on
estimated margin levels for 2004, earn-out payments related to the Basis
Petroleum and St. Charles Acquisitions of approximately $35 million and $50
million, respectively, would be due in May 2004 and January 2005.

For 2004, excluding the Aruba Refinery, Valero expects to incur approximately
$1.5 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.3 billion for
capital expenditures (approximately $625 million of which is for environmental
projects) and approximately $215 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst
costs. Capital expenditures for 2004 for the Aruba Refinery are estimated to
be approximately $100 million. The capital expenditure estimate excludes the
purchase of properties previously leased under four structured lease
arrangements, as further discussed in

“Structured Lease Arrangements”

under

“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”

below. The capital expenditure estimate
also excludes anticipated expenditures related to the earn-out contingency
agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. Valero continuously
evaluates its capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant.

Long-Term Debt

Payments for long-term debt are at stated values and include payments for debt
related to bank facilities as described below under the caption

“Other
Commercial Commitments.”

None of Valero’s agreements have rating agency triggers that would
automatically require Valero to post additional collateral. However, in the
event of certain downgrades of Valero’s senior unsecured debt to below
investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services, borrowings



under some of Valero’s bank credit facilities, structured leases and other
arrangements would become more expensive.

Operating Lease Obligations

Valero’s operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities
and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation
equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage,
transportation, production and sale of refined products. Operating lease
obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining
noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be
received by Valero under subleases. Operating lease obligations
exclude long-term operating lease commitments that have been funded through structured
lease arrangements with non-consolidated third-party entities as discussed
below under the caption

“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”

and in Note 23 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are reflected
separately in the table above.

Purchase Obligations

A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to
purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i)
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable
price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. Valero
has various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply
arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other
feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling
agreements. Valero enters into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of
utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its refineries. Many of Valero’s
purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market
indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on Valero’s usage requirements. The
purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term
and long-term obligations and are based on minimum quantities to be purchased
and/or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. Future
payments related to benefit plans are not included in the table above due to
the difficulty in estimating such payments that results from the many variables
affecting the calculation. Valero has not made in the past, nor does it expect
to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that it has not
received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing
market conditions.

As of December 31, 2003, Valero had $256.1 million of letters of credit
outstanding under its uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $7.8
million of letters of credit outstanding under its Canadian committed facility
and $245.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under its committed
facilities.

Under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities, Valero’s
debt-to-capitalization ratio (net of cash) was 40.3% as of December 31, 2003 as
compared to 50.4% as of December 31, 2002. For purposes of the computation as
of December 31, 2002, 50% of the $200 million of TOPrS and 20% of the $172.5
million of trust preferred securities issued as part of the PEPS Units were
included as debt.

Valero’s refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in
the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and
retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact Valero’s overall
exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these
customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
However, Valero believes that its portfolio of accounts receivable is
sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit
risk. Historically, Valero has not had any significant problems collecting its
accounts receivable.

Valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations, and to the extent
necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to
fund its ongoing operating requirements. Valero expects that, to the extent
necessary, it can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or
debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the
availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made
available on terms acceptable to Valero.

PEPS Units

As of December 31, 2002, the “company-obligated preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts” in Valero’s consolidated balance sheet included $172.5
million of 7.75% PEPS Units (6.9 million units at $25.00 per unit). The PEPS
Units were issued in 2000 by Valero under a shelf registration statement. Upon
issuance, each PEPS Unit consisted of a trust preferred security issued by VEC
Trust I and an associated purchase contract obligating the holder of the PEPS
Unit to purchase on August 18, 2003 a number of shares of common stock from
Valero for $25 per purchase contract. The number of shares of common stock
issuable for each purchase contract was to be determined at a price based on
the average price of Valero common stock for the relevant 20-day trading
period. Under the original agreement, holders of PEPS Units could settle their
purchase contracts by paying cash to Valero or by remarketing their pledged
trust preferred securities and using the proceeds from the remarketing to
settle the purchase contracts. In accordance with the original agreement, the
distribution rate on the trust preferred securities was to be reset on August
18, 2003 based on the price for which the trust preferred securities were
remarketed. In accordance with the terms of the trust, on August 12, 2003,
Valero dissolved VEC Trust I and substituted its senior deferrable notes for
the trust preferred securities. As a result, Valero’s senior deferrable notes
were scheduled to be remarketed in place of the trust preferred



securities, with the interest rate on the senior deferrable notes to be reset
on August 18, 2003 based upon the price for which the senior deferrable notes
were remarketed.

The remarketing of the senior deferrable notes was scheduled for August 13,
2003. The holders of approximately 6.36 million PEPS Units opted to settle
their purchase contract obligations by remarketing the senior deferrable notes
(totaling $158.9 million), while holders of approximately 0.54 million PEPS
Units elected to settle their purchase contract obligations with cash and
retain their senior deferrable notes (totaling $13.6 million) in lieu of
participating in the remarketing. On August 13, Valero received notice from
the remarketing agent that a failed remarketing (as defined in the prospectus
supplement related to the PEPS Units) of the senior deferrable notes was deemed
to have occurred. The $158.9 million of senior deferrable notes surrendered to
Valero to satisfy the holders’ purchase contract obligations were retained by
Valero in full satisfaction of the holders’ obligations under the purchase
contracts and were canceled on August 18, 2003. The remaining $13.6 million of
senior deferrable notes mature on August 18, 2005 and bear an interest rate of
6.797%. Valero, in turn, issued 4.9 million shares of its common stock at a
price of $34.95 per share in settlement of the 6.9 million purchase contracts.

Equity

On March 28, 2003, Valero sold in a public offering 6.3 million shares of its common stock at a price of $40.25 per share and received
net proceeds of $250.3 million. These shares were issued under Valero’s shelf registration statement, with the proceeds used to repay borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities.

In connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, Valero issued
10 million shares of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock. Valero pays
annual dividends of $0.50 for each share of convertible preferred stock when
and if declared by its board of directors. Dividends are paid quarterly,
provided that dividends will not accrue or be payable with respect to a
particular calendar quarter if Valero does not declare a dividend on its common
stock during that calendar quarter.

Under common stock repurchase programs approved by Valero’s Board of Directors,
Valero repurchases shares of its common stock from time to time for use in
connection with its employee benefit plans and other general corporate
purposes. During 2003, Valero repurchased shares of its common stock under
these programs at a cost of $73.2 million. Through February 2004, Valero has
not had any significant additional common share repurchases under these
programs.

On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 7.8 million shares of its
common stock, which included 1.0 million shares related to an overallotment
option exercised by the underwriter, at a price of $53.25 per share and
received proceeds, net of underwriter’s discount and commissions, of $406.0
million. These shares were issued under Valero’s shelf registration statement
to partially fund the acquisition of the Aruba Refinery and related operations.

Pension Plan Funded Status

During 2003, Valero contributed approximately $121 million to its qualified
pension plans. Based on a 6.25% discount rate and fair values of plan assets
as of December 31, 2003, the fair value of the assets in Valero’s qualified
plans were equal to approximately 68% of the projected benefit obligation under
those plans as of the end of 2003. However, the qualified plans were more than
90% funded based on their “current liability,” which is a funding measure
defined under applicable pension regulations.

Environmental Matters

Valero is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the
environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and
characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because
environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and
new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or
proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters
will increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of
Valero’s refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply
with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding



Valero’s environmental matters, including a discussion of capital expenditures
related to environmental regulations, see “Environmental Matters” in Items 1 &
2, “Business & Properties.”

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

As of December 31, 2002, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with
a third-party financial institution to sell on a revolving basis up to $250
million of eligible trade and credit card receivables, which matures in October
2005. In June 2003, Valero amended its agreement to add two additional
financial institutions to the program and to increase the size of its facility
by $350 million to $600 million. Under this program, wholly owned subsidiaries
of Valero sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible
receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions.
Valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays
certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. As of
December 31, 2003, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party
financial institutions was $600 million.

Structured Lease Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, Valero had various long-term operating lease
commitments that were funded through structured lease arrangements with a
financial institution (the lessor), which are summarized below (in millions):

The lessor constructed or purchased the related assets and then leased them to
Valero. The assets held by the lessor were funded through equity contributions
of the lessor ranging from 3% to 5% of the fair market value of the asset and
borrowings from other financial institutions. Neither Valero, its affiliates
nor any related parties held any interest in the lessor. For each lease,
Valero had the option to purchase the leased assets at any time during the
lease term for a price that approximated fair value.

Valero has historically used these structured lease arrangements to provide
additional liquidity to fund its ongoing operations. However, the cost of
administering such structured lease arrangements has escalated over the years,
in large part due to more extensive and increasingly complex accounting rules
related to such transactions. Recent accounting pronouncements, including Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which is
discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as
speeches by representatives of organizations such as the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the FASB, have emphasized the need for and the
desirability of more transparency in reported financial information. To
achieve that objective, new accounting pronouncements related to structured
leases have become more complex and compliance with such pronouncements has
become increasingly costly and burdensome. Valero desires to support the
accounting profession’s objectives for enhanced transparency in financial
reports and, at the same time, eliminate the ongoing and increasing costs
inherent in ensuring that these arrangements continue to qualify for
off-balance sheet treatment. As a result, in March 2004, Valero exercised its
option to purchase the leased properties under each of its four existing
structured lease



arrangements, and the leased properties were purchased through borrowings under
Valero’s existing bank credit facilities. Valero anticipates refinancing these
amounts through the issuance in the near future of term notes at favorable
rates. If the purchase of the leased properties had occurred as of December
31, 2003, Valero’s outstanding debt would have increased by $531 million, and
Valero’s debt-to-capitalization ratio would have been 43.5%. As indicated
above in the discussion of

“Other Commercial Commitments,”

Valero believes that
it has sufficient funds available from various sources to fund its ongoing
operating requirements. As a result, Valero does not believe that the above
action will significantly affect its liquidity or its ability to fund its
ongoing operations.

Guarantees

In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business, Valero guaranteed
certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which
totaled approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2003. This lease expires
in 2010.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain
new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have
already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
or will become effective for Valero’s financial statements at various dates in
the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is not
expected to have, a material effect on Valero’s consolidated financial
statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following summary provides further information about Valero’s
critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes Valero’s
significant accounting policies.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery
feedstocks purchased for processing and produced products are determined under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory pricing. The cost of
feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials,
supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted-average cost method. Valero utilizes the dollar-value LIFO method and uses
average purchase prices during the year to value any increments to its LIFO
inventory.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Valero records depreciation expense on its property, plant and equipment using
the composite method of depreciation. Under the composite method of
depreciation, the costs of minor property units, net of salvage value, retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation while gains or
losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in income.
Accounting for property, plant and equipment requires various judgments and
estimates, including a determination of remaining useful lives, salvage values
and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains
and losses.

In June 2001, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
issued an exposure draft of a proposed Statement of Position (SOP) entitled
“Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and
Equipment,” which addressed accounting for depreciation and replacement of
property, plant and equipment. The exposure draft concluded that component
accounting for a replacement of property,



plant and equipment should occur at the time of replacement. If an entity
replaces part of a property, plant and equipment asset that has not previously
been accounted for as a component, and the replacement meets the definition of
a component, then the entity should capitalize the cost of the replacement,
account for it as a separate component, estimate the net book value of the
replaced item, and charge the net book value of the replaced item to
depreciation expense in the period of replacement. Therefore, a consequence of
not previously applying component accounting is that the net book value of the
replaced item is charged to depreciation expense in the period of the
replacement, with net book value calculated using the expected useful life of
the total property, plant and equipment asset to which the component relates.
In addition, if the provisions of the exposure draft are enacted and component
rather than composite accounting is required, significant additional estimates
and judgments will be required due to the additional volume of assets to be
accounted for individually. The proposed SOP is expected to be considered for
approval by the FASB in April 2004. If the proposed SOP is approved, its
provisions would be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2004.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Long-lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite
useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives should be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should
be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and
exceeds its fair value.

In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of
projected cash flows related to the asset which include, but are not limited
to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining
life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s
existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must
make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an
assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates,
interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could significantly impact the
fair value of the long-lived asset, goodwill and other intangible assets. Due
to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for
recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could
result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting Valero’s
earnings.

Refinery Turnaround Costs

Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance activities at Valero’s refineries, are deferred when incurred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse
until the next turnaround occurs. The frequency of refinery turnarounds varies
with each refinery operating unit. As of December 31, 2003, Valero had $192.3
million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated
balance sheet.

The AICPA’s exposure draft of a proposed SOP entitled “Accounting for Certain
Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment,” discussed above
under “Property, Plant and Equipment,” also addressed accounting for the costs
of planned major maintenance activities. The exposure draft concluded that the
total cost of planned major maintenance activities cannot be deferred, but that
the individual costs incurred in such planned major maintenance activities
should be evaluated to determine if they represent the acquisition of
additional components or the replacement of existing components. All other
costs incurred in a planned major maintenance activity should be charged to
expense as incurred. If the provisions of the exposure draft are enacted and
turnaround costs are ultimately expensed as incurred, Valero’s reported income
would become more volatile. The proposed SOP is expected to be considered for
approval by the FASB in April 2004. If



the proposed SOP is approved, its provisions would be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2004.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, Valero
must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be
recovered through future taxable income. To the extent Valero believes that
recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded
against deferred income tax assets. Valero has recorded a valuation allowance
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, due to uncertainties related to its ability
to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of
certain state net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits
carried forward, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on
Valero’s estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it
operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be
recoverable. If actual results differ from the estimates or Valero adjusts the
estimates in future periods, Valero may need to revise the valuation allowance.
The net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2003 were $600.1
million, net of a valuation allowance of $82.6 million.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, “Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations,” which established accounting standards for
recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
and the associated asset retirement cost. An entity is required to recognize
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period
in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If
a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset
retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.

In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and
assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a
credit-adjusted risk-free rate, and an assessment of market conditions that
could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement
obligation. These estimates and assumptions are very subjective. However,
Valero believes it has adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations.
See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of
the effect of Valero’s adoption of Statement No. 143.

Environmental Liabilities

Valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state
and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the
environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures. Future
legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to
required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital
expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this
time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of
probable undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and
applying current regulations, as well as Valero’s own internal environmental
policies. Valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its environmental
exposures. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and
estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible
contamination, the timing and extent of remediation, the determination of
Valero’s liability in proportion to other parties, improvements in cleanup
technologies, and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may
change in the future.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs
that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Changes in
these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside Valero’s control.
For example, the discount rate assumption is based on Moody’s published Aa
corporate bond rate as of the end of each year, while the expected return on
plan



assets is based on a compounded return calculated for Valero by an outside
consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through 2001 with an
asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, representative of the asset mix
in Valero’s qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant
effect on the amounts reported in Valero’s consolidated financial statements.
For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate
or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions
related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase
would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of
December 31, 2003 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31,
2004 (in millions):

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and
refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used
in its refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price
fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion
of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its
unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value
hedges). Valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price
risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and natural gas
purchases and refined product sales (cash flow hedges). In addition, Valero
uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price
volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories and on certain
forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that do not receive hedge
accounting treatment. These derivative instruments are considered economic
hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of
sales. Finally, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading
purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions.
See “Derivative Instruments” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types
of derivative transactions.

The types of instruments used in Valero’s hedging and trading activities
described above include swaps, futures and options. Valero’s positions in
derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by
a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valero’s stated risk management
policy which has been approved by Valero’s Board of Directors.



The following tables provide information about Valero’s derivative commodity
instruments as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions, except for
the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including:

•

fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and
unrecognized firm commitments,

•

cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock or product
purchases and refined product sales,

•

economic hedges held to:

•

manage price volatility in refined product inventories, and

•

manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock, natural gas
and refined product purchases, and

•

trading activities held or issued for trading purposes.

Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and
refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas).
The weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for
crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units
(for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which
are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. The gain (loss) on
swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the
receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. For
futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair
value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of
the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions.
Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price
represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average
receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The
weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options
represents their strike price.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Valero’s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to
its long-term debt obligations. Valero manages its exposure to changing
interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate
debt. In addition, Valero utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage a
portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain
fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are
generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting
gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the
derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. In
connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero assumed certain interest rate swap
agreements entered into by UDS in order to manage interest rate exposure on
certain fixed-rate debt obligations. These agreements, which were all
terminated in early 2003, were accounted for as speculative transactions.

The following table provides information about Valero’s long-term debt and
interest rate derivative instruments (in millions, except interest rates), all
of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt,
principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected
maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents
notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates by expected (contractual)
maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual
payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted-average floating rates
are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

Valero enters into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage
its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its
Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are
recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of
translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are
intended to hedge. During May 2002, Valero entered into foreign currency
exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an
investment in its Canadian operations that Valero intended to redeem in the
future. Under these contracts, Valero sold $400 million of Canadian dollars
and bought $253.4 million of U.S. dollars. The following tables present the
notional amounts of these contracts by expected (contractual) maturity dates
and the total fair value of the contracts as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in
millions):

In February 2004, Valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in
its Canadian operations. As a result, Valero liquidated the outstanding amount
of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by Valero of
approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first
quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts.

As of December 31, 2003, Valero had other commitments to purchase $16.7 million
of U.S. dollars and sell $6.7 million of U.S. dollars. Valero’s market risk
was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before January 9, 2004.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash
flows and comprehensive income for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year
ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations and whose report dated March 5, 2002 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those statements before the revisions described in Notes 21 and 28.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Valero Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. As described in Notes 21 and 28, these consolidated
financial statements have been revised. We audited (i) the reclassification
adjustments applied to revise the segment disclosures in Note 21, and (ii) the
reclassification adjustments discussed in Note 28, that were applied to revise
the 2001 consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such
reclassification adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied.
However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the
2001 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect
to such reclassification adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

As used in this report, the term Valero may refer to Valero Energy Corporation,
one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole.
Valero, an independent refining and marketing company, owned and operated 14
refineries as of December 31, 2003 (six in Texas, two each in California and
Louisiana, and one each in Colorado, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Quebec, Canada)
with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 2.1 million barrels per
day. Valero markets refined products through an extensive bulk and rack
marketing network and a network of more than 4,500 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United
States and eastern Canada under various brand names including primarily Diamond
Shamrock®, Shamrock®, Ultramar®, Valero® and Beacon®. Valero’s operations are
affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and
refinery maintenance turnarounds;

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during
the summer driving season and heating oil during the winter season; and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil
prices, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply
capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds.

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and
subsidiaries in which Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 50% or
less owned entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting
(see Note 9 for a discussion of the reporting change for Valero’s investment in
Valero L.P.).

The term UDS Acquisition refers to the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock
Corporation (UDS) into Valero effective December 31, 2001.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on
currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result
in revised estimates.

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments

Valero’s temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt
instruments which have a maturity of three months or less when acquired. Cash
and temporary cash investments exclude cash that is not available to Valero due
to restrictions related to its use. Such amounts are segregated in the
consolidated balance sheets in “restricted cash” (see Note 3).

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery
feedstocks purchased for processing and produced products are determined under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Valero uses the dollar-value LIFO method
with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year.
The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of
materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined
principally under the weighted-average cost method.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Additions to property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and
certain costs allocable to construction and property purchases, are recorded at
cost.

The costs of minor property units (or components of property units), net of
salvage value, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated
depreciation under the composite method of depreciation. Gains or losses on
sales or other dispositions of major units of property are recorded in income
and are reported in “depreciation and amortization expense” in the consolidated
statements of income.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, including amortization of assets
acquired under capital leases, is recorded primarily on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related facilities. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair
value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Intangible assets are
assets that lack physical substance (excluding financial assets). In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB), goodwill acquired in a business combination completed after June
30, 2001 and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized
and intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized. Effective
January 1, 2002, Valero adopted the provisions of Statement No. 142 resulting
in no significant impact to the consolidated financial statements. The
provisions of Statement No. 142 require that goodwill and intangible assets not
subject to amortization be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired.
Valero adopted October 1st of each year as its annual valuation date for the
impairment test.

Deferred Charges and Other Assets

“Deferred charges and other assets, net” include the following:

•

refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with
planned major maintenance activities at Valero’s refineries and which are
deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs;

•

fixed-bed catalyst costs, which represent the cost of catalyst that
is changed out at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst
has deteriorated beyond its prescribed function and which are deferred when
incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the specific catalyst;

•

investments in 50% or less owned entities, which are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting; and

•

other noncurrent assets such as notes receivable, long-term
investments, debt issuance costs and various other costs.

Valero evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when there is
evidence that it may not be able to recover the carrying amount of its
investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that
justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment which is
other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is
based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the
investment and its carrying value. Valero believes that the carrying value of
its equity method investments was not impaired as of December 31, 2003.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, Valero adopted Statement No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of.

Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indeterminate
lives, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if
the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an asset is not
recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value
determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows. There was no impact
to Valero’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adoption of this
statement.

Taxes Other than Income Taxes

“Taxes other than income taxes” includes primarily liabilities for ad valorem
taxes, excise taxes and payroll taxes.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, “Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations,” which establishes financial accounting and
reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The provisions of
this statement apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development
and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain
obligations of lessees.

On January 1, 2003, Valero recognized an asset retirement obligation of $30.0
million, which is included in “other long-term liabilities,” and an increase to
net property, plant and equipment of $25.8 million. The implementation of
Statement No. 143 resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.2 million, which was
included in the consolidated statements of income in “other income (expense),
net” versus presentation as a cumulative effect of an accounting change due to
immateriality. This asset retirement obligation relates to the removal of
underground storage tanks from Valero’s retail sites. Valero has also
determined that an asset retirement obligation exists related to its refinery
assets. However, the fair value of the asset retirement obligation associated
with these refinery assets cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement
dates are indeterminate; therefore, no obligation was recorded for these
refinery assets. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the changes in
Valero’s asset retirement obligation were as follows (in millions):

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of Valero’s Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar.
The translation into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts
using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for revenue and
expense accounts using the weighted-average exchange rate during the year.
Adjustments resulting from this translation are reported in “accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).”

Revenue Recognition

Revenues for products sold by both the refining and retail segments are
recorded upon delivery of the products to their customers, which is the point
at which title to the products is transferred, and when payment has either been
received or collection is reasonably assured. Revenues for services are
recorded when the services have been provided. Revenues include the sales
portion of contracts involving purchases and sales necessary to reposition
supply to address location, quality or grade requirements.

Product Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in “cost of
sales” in the consolidated statements of income.

Environmental Matters

Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude

of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or
other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs
using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well
as Valero’s own internal environmental policies. The environmental liabilities
have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties of amounts
payable by Valero.

Derivative Instruments

All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets
or liabilities measured at their fair value. When Valero enters into a
derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow
hedge, an economic hedge or a trading instrument. For Valero’s economic
hedging relationships (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges)
and for derivative instruments entered into by Valero for trading purposes, the
derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value
of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The gain or
loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value
hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable
to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The
effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and
qualifying as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of “other
comprehensive income” and is reclassified into income in the same period or
periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The
remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument,
if any, is recognized currently in income.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This statement amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The provisions of Statement No. 149:

•

clarify the circumstances under which a contract with an initial
net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative,

•

clarify when a derivative contains a financing component,

•

amend the definition of an underlying (for example, a specified
interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate,
etc.) to conform it to language used in FIN 45, and

•

amend certain other existing pronouncements.

Valero adopted the provisions of Statement No. 149 for derivative contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement
did not have an impact on Valero’s financial position or results of operations.

Financial Instruments

Valero’s financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments,
restricted cash, receivables, payables, debt, interest rate swaps, commodity
contracts and foreign currency contracts. The estimated fair values of these
financial instruments approximate their carrying values as reflected in the
consolidated balance sheets, except for certain long-term debt as discussed in
Note 12. The fair value of Valero’s debt, interest rate swaps, commodity
contracts and foreign currency contracts was estimated based on year-end quoted
market prices.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within its scope as a liability because that financial
instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. Statement No. 150 requires
three types of financial instruments to be accounted for as liabilities:

•

mandatorily redeemable financial instruments,

•

obligations to repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets, and

•

obligations that must or may be settled with shares, the monetary
value of which (a) is fixed, (b) is tied to a variable such as a market
index, or (c) varies inversely with the value of the issuer’s shares.

Statement No. 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of
the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003.

On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150-3,
“Effective Date, Disclosures, and Transition for Mandatorily Redeemable
Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under Statement No. 150, Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity,” which deferred the applicable implementation date for Statement No.
150 for certain existing contracts, including Valero’s PEPS Units, from the
third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2003. As a result, the adoption of this
statement did not have an impact on Valero’s financial position or results of
operations.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to
common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the year. Earnings per common share – assuming dilution reflects the potential
dilution of Valero’s outstanding stock options and performance awards granted
to employees in connection with Valero’s stock compensation plans, as well as
the 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock discussed in Note 15 and the PEPS
Units prior to the settlement of the related purchase contract obligations as
discussed in Note 14.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses
affecting stockholders’ equity that, under United States generally accepted
accounting principles, are excluded from net income, such as foreign currency
translation adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments and gains and
losses related to certain derivative instruments.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” which was subsequently revised in December 2003
(FIN 46). FIN 46 requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity
(VIE) in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses
and/or receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns as a
result of ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the entity.
Prior to the issuance of FIN 46, an entity generally was consolidated by an
enterprise when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest through
ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity.

When originally issued in January 2003, FIN 46 was immediately applicable to
VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which an enterprise
obtained an interest after that date. However, for VIEs created before
February 1, 2003, FIN 46 first became applicable as of the first fiscal year or
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 (July 1, 2003 for Valero). In
October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 46-6, “Effective Date
of FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”
which deferred



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the applicable implementation date for FIN 46 for VIEs created before February
1, 2003 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2003. However, early
adoption was permitted, and Valero elected to adopt FIN 46 effective July 1,
2003 for VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. The revisions to FIN 46 in
December 2003 have not resulted in any change in the original application of
FIN 46 to Valero’s consolidated financial statements.

Valero had various long-term operating lease commitments that were funded
through structured lease arrangements with non-consolidated third-party
entities. These lease agreements provided for maximum residual value
guarantees ranging from 82% to 87% of the appraised value of the leased
properties at the end of the lease term, as determined at the inception of the
lease. During the second quarter of 2003, Valero exercised its purchase option
under three such leases, purchasing one of its current headquarters buildings
and certain convenience stores as discussed further in Note 23. The remaining
leased assets were acquired by a single financial institution which is not a
VIE. Accordingly, under the provisions of FIN 46, Valero’s interest in these
structured lease arrangements was not consolidated in its consolidated
financial statements as of December 31, 2003. See Note 23 for a discussion of
the purchase of these leased properties in March 2004.

Valero has investments in 50% or less owned entities (including Valero L.P. and
two joint ventures) that were created prior to February 1, 2003. These
investments have historically been accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Under FIN 46, Valero L.P. is not a VIE, but Valero’s joint venture
interests and its other contractual relationships with the joint ventures
represent variable interests in the joint ventures. Valero believes, however,
that it is not the primary beneficiary of any of the joint ventures. As a
result, Valero has not consolidated these investments under the provisions of
FIN 46, and it will continue to account for these investments under the equity
method of accounting.

In July 2003, Valero made an investment to obtain a 50% interest in a general
partnership established to construct and operate a crude oil pipeline, as
described in Note 10. Under FIN 46, the general partnership is not a VIE, and
therefore Valero has not consolidated this investment but is accounting for it
under the equity method of accounting.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 146, “Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which addresses accounting
for restructuring and similar costs. Such costs include lease termination
costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a
restructuring, discontinued operations, plant closings or other exit or
disposal activities. Statement No. 146 supercedes previous accounting
guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3. Under
EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of
the entity’s commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Statement No. 146
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized, at fair value, when the liability is incurred. There
was no impact to Valero’s consolidated financial statements as a result of
adoption of this statement.

Stock-Based Compensation

Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method of accounting set forth in APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations as permitted by
Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $15.29, $9.55 and $11.60 per stock option,
respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the
grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions:

Because Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method, compensation cost is not recognized in the consolidated
statements of income for Valero’s fixed stock option plans as all options
granted have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for Valero’s fixed
stock option plans been determined based on the grant-date fair value of awards
consistent with the method set forth in Statement No. 123, Valero’s net income
applicable to common stock, net income and earnings per common share, both with
and without dilution, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following

million, respectively.

Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revised statement
requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and
net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined
benefit postretirement plans. It did not change the measurement or recognition
of those plans required by Statement No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions,” Statement No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,”
and Statement No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions.” The revised Statement No. 132 was effective for financial
statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Valero adopted
the provisions of this revised statement as of December 31, 2003.

Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 addresses the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

obligations under guarantees. These disclosure requirements were effective for
financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15,
2002 and are included in Note 23. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is
required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation were applicable
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have an effect on Valero’s financial
position or results of operations.

FASB Staff Position 106-1

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, “Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” which permits the sponsor of a
postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to
make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act),
including the effect of a federal subsidy provided for in the Act. The
guidance of this Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 is effective for interim or
annual financial statements of fiscal years ending after December 7, 2003.
Valero sponsors a postretirement health care plan that provides prescription
drug benefits and has elected to defer recognition of the effects of the Act in
accounting for its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and net
periodic postretirement benefit cost related to its postretirement health care
plan. Specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the Act, including the
federal subsidy, is expected in the first or second quarter of 2004 and the
guidance, when issued, could require Valero to revise previously reported
information.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts in the 2002 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. In
addition, certain amounts in the 2001 consolidated statement of income were
reclassified to conform to the 2003 and 2002 presentation, as described in Note
28.

2. ACQUISITIONS

St. Charles Refinery

On July 1, 2003, Valero completed the purchase of the St. Charles Refinery (St.
Charles Acquisition) from Orion Refining Corporation (Orion). The refinery is
located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, approximately 15 miles west of New
Orleans. Consideration for the purchase, including various transaction costs
incurred, consisted of (in millions):

See “2% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock” in Note 15 for a further
discussion of the terms of the preferred stock. The purchase agreement
required 844,000 shares to be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of
certain conditions. The purchase agreement also provided for the assumption of
certain environmental and regulatory obligations as well as for potential
earn-out payments if agreed-upon refining margins reach a

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

specified level during any of the seven years following the closing. The
earn-out payments are subject to an annual maximum limit of $50 million and an
aggregate limit of $175 million.

The purchase price was allocated based on estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, pending the
completion of an independent appraisal and other evaluations. As of December
31, 2003, the preliminary purchase price allocation, including transaction
costs related to the acquisition, was as follows (in millions):

In accordance with Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations,” the potential
earn-out payments discussed above, or a portion of such potential payments, are
required to be accrued as part of the business combination if the net fair
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the cost of the
acquisition. Since the net fair value of the St. Charles Refinery will not be
known until the completion of the pending independent appraisal and other
evaluations, no potential earn-out payments have been recorded as of December
31, 2003.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information assumes that the St.
Charles Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This

discussed in Note 9, Valero L.P. acquired Telfer Oil Company’s California
asphalt terminal located near Valero’s Benicia Refinery for $15.1 million. The
asphalt terminal included two storage tanks with a combined storage capacity of
350,000 barrels, six 5,000-barrel polymer modified asphalt tanks, a truck rack,
rail facilities and various other tanks and equipment.

Effective December 31, 2003, Valero purchased from Link Energy LLC (formerly
EOTT Energy LLC) certain natural gas liquid (NGL) storage facilities located in
Mont Belvieu and idle MTBE plant assets located near the Houston Ship Channel
at Morgan’s Point for $20.0 million in cash. The Mont Belvieu assets include
ten NGL storage caverns with an aggregate rated capacity of approximately 10
million barrels and a 120-mile pipeline grid system connecting the Mont Belvieu
storage caverns to Morgan’s Point and to customers along the Houston Ship
Channel.

As of December 31, 2002, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with
a third-party financial institution to sell on a revolving basis up to $250
million of eligible trade and credit card receivables, which matures in October
2005. In June 2003, Valero amended its agreement to add two additional
financial institutions to the program and to increase the size of its facility
by $350 million to $600 million. Under this program, wholly owned subsidiaries
of Valero sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible
receivables, without recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Valero
remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays certain
fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. Under the facility,
Valero retains the residual interest in the designated pool of receivables.
This retained interest, which is included in “receivables, net” in the
consolidated balance sheets, is recorded at fair value. Due to (i) a short
average collection cycle for such receivables, (ii) Valero’s collection
experience history, and (iii) the composition of the designated pool of trade
and credit card accounts receivable that are part of this program, the fair
value of Valero’s retained interest approximates the total amount of the
designated pool of accounts receivable reduced by the amount of accounts
receivable sold to the third-party financial institutions under the program.
From the date of the UDS Acquisition until October 2002, Valero also had a $360
million revolving accounts receivable sales facility that was assumed in
connection with the UDS Acquisition, under which eligible credit card and trade
accounts receivable were sold on an ongoing basis through a wholly owned
subsidiary to a third-party financial institution.

The costs incurred by Valero related to these programs, which were included in
“other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of income, were
$6.2 million, $6.8 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Proceeds from collections under these
revolving accounts receivable sales facilities of $12.4 billion, $8.5 billion
and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, were reinvested in the programs by the third-party financial
institutions. However, the third-party financial institutions’ interests in
Valero’s accounts receivable were never in excess of the sales facility limits
at any time under these programs. No accounts receivable included in these
programs were written off during 2003, 2002 or 2001.

As of both December 31, 2003 and 2002, $1.1 billion of Valero’s accounts
receivable comprised the designated pools of trade and credit card accounts
receivable included in these programs. Of these amounts,

$600 million and $250 million, respectively, was sold to the third-party
financial institutions and the remaining amount was retained by Valero.

ended December 31, 2003 and 2001. The reduction of inventory volumes during
2002 resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower costs
which prevailed in prior years. The effect of the liquidation was to decrease
cost of sales by approximately $39 million.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the replacement cost of LIFO inventories
exceeded their LIFO carrying values by approximately $666 million and $586
million, respectively.

On February 28, 2003, Valero exercised its option under certain capital leases
with El Paso Corporation to purchase the Corpus Christi East Refinery and
related refined product logistics business, which have been operated by Valero
since June 1, 2001. In connection with the exercise of the purchase option,
the original purchase price for the assets was reduced by approximately $5
million to $289.3 million and the lease payment of approximately $5 million due
in the first quarter of 2003 was avoided. No gain or loss was recorded on this
transaction.

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$340.7 million, $316.3 million and $137.7 million, respectively. During 2003,
net gains of $14.6 million were recorded on the disposition of various
facilities, primarily resulting from the sale of certain retail stores and
Valero’s home heating oil business in the northeastern United States and
southern Ontario in Canada.

Subsequent to the UDS Acquisition in December 2001, Valero decided to
consolidate all of its corporate personnel at the location of the former
headquarters facility of UDS. Valero’s current headquarters facility consists
of two buildings: One Valero Place (OVP) and Two Valero Place (TVP). See Note
23 under

“Structured Lease Arrangements”

for a discussion of Valero’s purchases
of assets which had been leased under structured lease arrangements.

During the third quarter of 2003, Valero began evaluating its options regarding
the future retention or disposition of OVP and TVP. In December 2003, Valero’s
Board of Directors authorized the sale of OVP and TVP for $27.3 million. As a
result, a $25.8 million impairment charge was recognized in December 2003 to
write down the carrying value of OVP and TVP to their fair values less selling costs.
The impairment charge was reflected in “depreciation and amortization expense”
in the consolidated statement of income and was included in the corporate
category for segment reporting purposes as shown in Note 21. On January 20,
2004, Valero finalized an agreement to sell OVP and TVP for $27.3 million.
Valero expects to complete the sale of the buildings by the end of the second
quarter of 2004.

The settlements and adjustments related to tax matters reflected in the table above for the year
ended December 31, 2003, include settlements and adjustments related to various income tax matters that were assumed in the UDS Acquisition, the effects of which
were recorded as purchase price adjustments. Also included in the amount reflected above is the final purchase price allocation pertaining
to a pre-acquisition contingency related to a UDS franchise tax matter covering 1984 through 1997, which was settled for
an amount immaterial to Valero.

Because all of Valero’s goodwill arose subsequent to the effective date of
Statement No. 142, no amortization of goodwill is reflected in Valero’s
consolidated financial statements for any year presented. All of Valero’s
goodwill has been allocated among four reporting units that comprise the
refining segment. These reporting units are the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent,
Northeast and West Coast refining regions.

Valero completed its annual test for impairment of goodwill as of October 1,
2003 and 2002. Based on the results of the test, there was no impairment of
goodwill.

9. INVESTMENT IN AND TRANSACTIONS WITH VALERO L.P.

As of December 31, 2002, Valero owned 73.6% of Valero L.P., a limited
partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined product pipeline,
terminalling and storage tank assets. As of December 31, 2003, Valero owned
45.7% of Valero L.P.

Effective March 18, 2003, Valero L.P. issued 5,750,000 common units to the
public for aggregate proceeds of $211.3 million and completed a private
placement of $250 million of debt. The net proceeds, after issuance costs, of
$200.3 million and $247.3 million, respectively, combined with borrowings under
Valero L.P.’s credit facility and a contribution of $4.3 million by Valero to
maintain its 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P., were used to fund a
redemption of common units from Valero and the acquisition of certain storage
tanks and a pipeline system from Valero discussed further below.

Subsequent to Valero L.P.’s equity and debt offerings, Valero L.P. redeemed 3.8
million of its common units from Valero for $137.0 million, including $2.9
million representing the redemption of a proportionate amount of Valero’s
general partner interest. The proceeds from the redemption are reflected as a
reduction to Valero’s investment in Valero L.P. This redemption, combined with
the common unit issuance discussed above, reduced Valero’s ownership of Valero
L.P. to 49.5% as of March 18, 2003. At the same time, Valero L.P. amended its
partnership agreement to reduce the minimum vote required to remove the general
partner from



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

66-2/3% to 58% of Valero L.P.’s outstanding common and subordinated units,
excluding the units held by affiliates of Valero (see discussion below for
subsequent revisions to this minimum vote which were effective on March 11, 2004). As
a result of the issuance and redemption of Valero L.P. common units and the
partnership agreement changes, effective March 18, 2003, Valero ceased
consolidation of Valero L.P. and began using the equity method to account for
its investment in Valero L.P.

Subsequent to the equity and debt offerings and the common unit redemption by
Valero L.P. discussed above, Valero contributed to Valero L.P. 58 crude oil and
intermediate feedstock storage tanks located at Valero’s Corpus Christi West,
Texas City and Benicia Refineries for $200 million. Valero also contributed to
Valero L.P. a refined products pipeline system for $150 million. This
three-pipeline system connects Valero’s Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi
West and Three Rivers Refineries to markets in Houston, San Antonio and the
Texas Rio Grande Valley. The contribution of the storage tank assets and the
pipeline system resulted in proceeds in excess of the carrying value of the
contributed assets of $181.2 million for Valero. Due to Valero’s continuing
ownership interest in Valero L.P., $89.7 million of this excess was recorded as
a reduction to Valero’s investment in Valero L.P. and will be amortized over
the lives of the contributed assets. The remaining $91.5 million was deferred
and recorded in “other long-term liabilities” and will be amortized over the
life of the throughput, handling, terminalling and service agreements, which is
approximately 10 years.

No immediate gain was recognized as a result of the transactions discussed
above.

In connection with the contribution of the crude oil and intermediate feedstock
storage tanks and the three-pipeline system discussed above, Valero entered
into certain throughput, handling, terminalling and service agreements with
Valero L.P. In addition, Valero has other related-party transactions with
Valero L.P. for the use of Valero L.P.’s pipelines, terminals and crude oil
storage tank facilities. Under various agreements, Valero has agreed to use
Valero L.P.’s pipelines to transport crude oil shipped to and refined products
shipped from certain of Valero’s refineries and to use Valero L.P.’s refined
product terminals for certain terminalling services. In addition, Valero
provides Valero L.P. with the corporate functions of legal, accounting,
treasury, engineering, information technology and other services
(Administrative Fee) for an annual fee of $5.2 million through July 2008 (see
discussion below for subsequent revisions to the Administrative Fee which
occurred on March 11, 2004). Valero also provides personnel to Valero L.P. to
perform operating and maintenance services with respect to certain assets for
which Valero receives reimbursement from Valero L.P. Valero has also agreed to
indemnify Valero L.P. for certain environmental liabilities related to assets
sold by Valero to Valero L.P. that were known on the date the assets were sold
or are discovered within a specified number of years after the assets were sold
as a result of events occurring or conditions existing prior to the date of
sale.

Beginning March 18, 2003, the date Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P.,
Valero recognized in “cost of sales” both its costs related to the throughput,
handling, terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P. and the receipt
from Valero L.P. of payment for operating and maintenance services provided by
Valero to Valero L.P.

On April 16, 2003, 581,000 additional common units of Valero L.P. were issued
as a result of the exercise by the underwriters of a portion of their
overallotment option related to the March 18, 2003 common unit issuance,
reducing Valero’s ownership from 49.5% to 48.2%.

In August 2003, Valero L.P. closed on a public offering of common units,
selling 1,236,250 common units to the public at $41.15 per unit, before
underwriter’s discount of $1.85 per unit. Net proceeds from this common unit
offering, which further reduced Valero’s ownership interest in Valero L.P. to
slightly below 46%, were partially used by Valero L.P. to fund its purchase
from Valero of the Southlake refined products pipeline



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

for $29.9 million. The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 27,000 barrels
per day and extends 375 miles from Valero’s McKee Refinery to Valero L.P.’s
Southlake refined products terminal near Dallas, Texas. No immediate gain was
recognized by Valero as a result of this transaction. The gain of $2.4 million
was deferred and will be recognized over future periods, with $1.2 million
recognized as a reduction to Valero’s investment in Valero L.P. and $1.2
million recorded as a deferred credit in “other long-term liabilities.”

On March 11, 2004, an amendment to the Administrative Fee between Valero L.P.
and Valero was approved. Under the amendment, which is to become effective on
April 1, 2004, the new Administrative Fee will be equal to the actual cost of
Valero’s corporate employees dedicated to Valero L.P. matters (which will be
charged directly to Valero L.P.) plus an annual fee of $1.2 million. In
addition, the annual fee of $1.2 million will be increased by $1.2 million per
year over the next four years. Also on March 11, 2004, in an effort to
encourage additional investment in Valero L.P., the Board of Directors of
Valero agreed that the general partner’s incentive distribution provided for in
Valero L.P.’s partnership agreement would be capped at 25%. In addition, effective
March 11, 2004, Valero L.P. amended its partnership agreement to reduce the
minimum vote required to remove the general partner from 58% to a majority of
Valero L.P.’s outstanding common and subordinated units, excluding the units
held by affiliates of Valero.

10. DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS

Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project

Effective July 10, 2003, Valero and GulfTerra Energy Partners, L.P. (GulfTerra,
formerly El Paso Energy Partners, L.P.) each became a 50% interest owner in the
Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, a general partnership formed to construct
and operate a crude oil pipeline (the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project).
The project involves the construction and operation of a 390-mile crude oil
pipeline that is expected to deliver up to 500,000 barrels per day from the
Gulf of Mexico to the major refining areas of Port Arthur and Texas City,
Texas. GulfTerra will build and operate the pipeline, which is scheduled for
completion during the third quarter of 2004. Valero’s investment in the
Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project is accounted for using the equity method
and is included in “deferred charges and other assets, net” in the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, Valero’s
investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project totaled $106.1 million.

Tesoro Notes Receivable

In conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, the Federal Trade Commission approved
a consent decree requiring the divestiture of certain UDS assets. Those assets
and their related operations were referred to as the Golden Eagle Business and
included the 168,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle Refinery, the related
wholesale marketing business and branded retail stores located in northern
California.

In May 2002, the Golden Eagle Business was sold to Tesoro Refining and
Marketing Company (Tesoro). Valero received cash proceeds of $925 million and
two ten-year junior subordinated notes with face amounts totaling $150 million
as follows:

•

a $100 million note, due July 17, 2012, which was non-interest
bearing for the first five years and carried a 7.5% interest rate for
the remaining five-year period, and

•

a $50 million note, due July 17, 2012, which bore no interest
during the first year and carried interest at approximately 7.5% for
years two through ten.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The two notes were recorded with an initial fair value of $58.9 million using a
discount rate of 16%, which represented Valero’s best estimate of the fair
value of the notes at the closing date of the sale. The discount was being
amortized over the life of the notes and was reported as interest income in
“other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of income. The
notes receivable were included in Valero’s consolidated balance sheet in
“deferred charges and other assets, net.”

In November 2003, the Tesoro notes were sold to various investors.
Valero received net proceeds of $89.6 million. The net book value of the notes
at the time of sale was $72.6 million, resulting in a gain of $17.0 million
which was reported in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated
statement of income.

Revolving Bank Credit Facilities

On January 7, 2002, Valero financed the $2.1 billion cash portion of the UDS
Acquisition, which was recorded as a payable to UDS shareholders as of December
31, 2001, with proceeds from a $1.5 billion bridge loan facility and borrowings
under two new $750 million revolving bank credit facilities. The bridge loan
facility was a single-draw facility with a one-year maturity. Borrowings under
this facility were repaid in April 2002 with proceeds from a $1.8 billion debt
offering discussed below. The two revolving bank credit facilities provided
for commitments of $750 million for a five-year term and $750 million for a
364-day term, respectively. In November 2002, Valero renewed its $750 million
364-day revolving bank credit facility, and in November 2003, Valero replaced
its $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit facility with a new $750 million
three-year revolving credit facility with terms and conditions similar to the
364-day facility.

Subject to the commitment amounts and terms, Valero’s two revolving bank credit
facilities provide for borrowings to be made at various amounts, maturities and
interest rates, at the option of Valero. Valero will also be charged various
fees and expenses in connection with these facilities, including facility fees
and various letter of credit fees. The interest rates and fees under these
facilities are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to
Valero’s long-term debt. These facilities include certain restrictive
covenants, including a coverage ratio and a debt-to-capitalization ratio. As
of December 31, 2003, borrowings under these committed facilities were $260
million while letters of credit outstanding were approximately $245.0 million.

In addition to Valero’s two $750 million revolving bank credit facilities, a
Canadian subsidiary of Valero has a committed revolving credit facility under
which it may borrow and obtain letters of credit up to Cdn. $115 million. As
of December 31, 2003, Valero had Cdn. $7.8 million of letters of credit
outstanding under the Canadian revolving credit facility.

As of December 31, 2003, Valero had no borrowings outstanding under its
uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities; however, there were $256.1
million of letters of credit outstanding under such facilities. As of December
31, 2002, Valero had $3 million outstanding under an uncommitted short-term
bank credit facility with an interest rate of 2.75%. In addition, Valero had
$147.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term
facilities as of December 31, 2002. Valero’s uncommitted credit facilities
have no commitment or other fees or compensating balance requirements and are
unsecured and unrestricted as to use.

Other Long-Term Debt

On April 15, 2002, Valero issued $1.8 billion of notes under its $3.5 billion
shelf registration statement as follows:

•

$300 million of 6.125% notes due April 15, 2007,

•

$750 million of 6.875% notes due April 15, 2012, and

•

$750 million of 7.5% notes due April 15, 2032.

The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valero’s
option. Proceeds from this offering were used to repay all borrowings under
Valero’s $1.5 billion bridge loan facility associated with the UDS Acquisition
and reduce borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities.

In June 2002, Valero L.P. and Valero Logistics Operations, L.P., indirect
subsidiaries of Valero as of December 31, 2002, filed a $500 million universal
shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In July 2002, Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. issued $100 million of 6.875%
senior notes due 2012 under the registration statement. The notes are
unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valero Logistics
Operations, L.P.’s option. The net proceeds from the offering were used to
repay



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

$91.0 million outstanding under the Valero Logistics Operations, L.P. revolving
credit facility and for general partnership purposes. As discussed in Note 9,
effective March 18, 2003, Valero ceased consolidation of Valero L.P. and began
using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P.
Accordingly, the notes are no longer included in Valero’s consolidated balance
sheet.

In July 2002, $275 million of 8.625% guaranteed notes matured and were repaid
with borrowings under Valero’s revolving bank credit facilities.

In November 2002, Valero issued $50 million of 6.311% notes due November 30,
2007 under its shelf registration statement. Interest is payable
semi-annually. The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in
part, at Valero’s option.

In December 2002, Valero issued $180 million of 6.7% senior notes due January
15, 2013 under its shelf registration statement. Interest is payable
semi-annually. The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in
part, at Valero’s option. Almost all of these notes were issued in exchange
for the $150 million of 6.75% notes issued to the Valero Pass-Through Asset
Trust 1997-1 in 1997 and to terminate an option held by a third party to
purchase the 6.75% notes on December 15, 2002.

On June 4, 2003, Valero issued $300 million of 4.75% notes due June 15, 2013
under its shelf registration statement. Interest is payable semi-annually.
The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valero’s
option. The net proceeds from this offering of $296.8 million were used to
redeem $200 million of TOPrS discussed below in Note 14 and $100 million
of 8% debentures due 2023. A premium of $3.8 million was
paid and expensed in the second quarter of 2003 as a result of the early
redemption of the 8% debentures.

In August 2003, $13.6 million of 6.797% notes became outstanding as a result of
the cash settlement of certain purchase contract obligations associated with
Valero’s PEPS Units. See Note 14 below for a further discussion of the

Environmental liabilities reflect the long-term portion of Valero’s estimated
remediation costs for environmental matters as discussed in Note 24. Deferred gain reflects
the unamortized balance of a portion of the proceeds in excess of the carrying
value of assets contributed and sold by Valero to Valero L.P. as discussed in Note 9. Tax liabilities other than income taxes reflect long-term
liabilities for franchise taxes and excise taxes and also include interest accrued on all tax- related liabilities, including income taxes.
See Note 1 under “

Asset Retirement Obligations

” for a discussion of the
liability related to asset retirement obligations reflected in the table above.

Unfavorable lease obligations reflect the fair value of liabilities assumed in
connection with the UDS Acquisition related to lease agreements for retail
facilities and vessel charters. In June 2003, Valero purchased certain
convenience stores which were subject to structured lease arrangements for
approximately $215 million. Approximately $88 million of the payment was
recorded as a reduction of the unfavorable lease obligation that was recorded
in conjunction with the UDS Acquisition.

14. COMPANY-OBLIGATED PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS

Company-obligated preferred securities of subsidiary trusts as of December 31,
2002 consisted of:

•

$200 million of Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) which
were redeemable at Valero’s option, and

•

$172.5 million of Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS
Units) which were mandatorily redeemable.

TOPrS

In conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, Valero assumed $200 million of 8.32%
TOPrS (8,000,000 units at $25.00 per unit), which were issued by UDS Capital I
(the Trust). Distributions on the TOPrS were cumulative and payable quarterly
in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 if and when the
Trust had funds available for distribution, at the annual rate of 8.32% of the
liquidation amount of $25.00 per TOPrS.

In June 2003, the TOPrS were redeemed with proceeds from the issuance of $300
million of 4.75% notes as described in Note 12.

PEPS Units

In June 2000, Valero issued $172.5 million of PEPS Units under a shelf
registration statement (6,900,000 units at $25.00 per unit). Upon issuance,
each PEPS Unit consisted of a trust preferred security issued by VEC Trust I
and an associated purchase contract obligating the holder of the PEPS Unit to
purchase on August 18, 2003 a number of shares of common stock from Valero for
$25 per purchase contract. The number of shares of common stock issuable for
each purchase contract was to be determined at a price based on the average
price of Valero common stock for the relevant 20-day trading period. Under the
original agreement, holders of PEPS Units could settle their purchase contracts
by paying cash to Valero or by remarketing their pledged trust preferred
securities and using the proceeds from the remarketing to settle the purchase
contracts. In accordance with the original agreement, the distribution rate on
the trust preferred securities, which was 7.75% on date of issuance, was to be
reset on August 18, 2003 based on the price for which the trust preferred
securities were remarketed. In accordance with the terms of the trust, on
August 12, 2003, Valero dissolved the trust and substituted its senior
deferrable notes for the trust preferred securities. As a result, Valero’s
senior deferrable notes were scheduled to be remarketed in place of the trust
preferred securities, with the interest rate on the senior deferrable notes to
be reset on August 18, 2003 based upon the price for which the senior
deferrable notes were remarketed.

The remarketing of the senior deferrable notes was scheduled for August 13,
2003. The holders of approximately 6.36 million PEPS Units opted to settle
their purchase contract obligations by remarketing the senior deferrable notes
(totaling $158.9 million), while holders of approximately 0.54 million PEPS
Units elected to settle their purchase contract obligations with cash and
retain their senior deferrable notes (totaling $13.6 million) in lieu of
participating in the remarketing. On August 13, Valero received notice from
the remarketing agent that a failed remarketing (as defined in the prospectus
supplement related to the PEPS Units) of the senior deferrable notes was deemed
to have occurred. The $158.9 million of senior deferrable notes surrendered to
Valero to satisfy the holders’ purchase contract obligations were retained by
Valero in full satisfaction of the holders’ obligations under the purchase
contracts and were canceled on August 18, 2003. The remaining $13.6 million of
senior deferrable notes mature on August 18, 2005 and bear an interest rate



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

of 6.797%. Valero, in turn, issued 4.9 million shares of its common stock at a
price of $34.95 per share in settlement of the 6.9 million purchase contracts.

Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon settlement of the
purchase contract obligations, the number of shares of Valero common stock
included in the calculation of “earnings per common share – assuming dilution”
for each reporting period was calculated using the treasury stock method. For
this purpose, the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the purchase
contract obligations was based on the applicable conversion formula in the PEPS
Unit agreement, using the average closing price of Valero’s common stock over
the 20-day trading period ending on the third trading day prior to the end of
the reporting period.

15. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

2% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock

In connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery from Orion,
effective July 1, 2003, Valero issued 10 million shares of 2% mandatory
convertible preferred stock. The mandatory convertible preferred stock had a
fair value of $22 per share, or an aggregate of $220 million. Of this amount,
$21.3 million was attributable to beneficial conversion terms of the preferred
stock and was recorded in “additional paid-in capital” in the consolidated
balance sheets with the remaining $198.7 million reflected as “preferred
stock.” The resulting $21.3 million preferred stock discount is being amortized
as additional preferred stock dividends through June 30, 2006, the day before
the mandatory conversion of the preferred stock as discussed below.

The mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to Valero
common stock on July 1, 2006, unless converted sooner. Valero pays annual
dividends of $0.50 for each share of convertible preferred stock when and if
declared by its board of directors. Dividends are paid quarterly, provided
that dividends will not accrue or be payable with respect to a particular
calendar quarter if Valero does not declare a dividend on its common stock
during that calendar quarter. The convertible preferred stock ranks with
respect to dividend rights and rights upon Valero’s liquidation, winding-up or
dissolution as follows:

(i)

senior to all common stock and to all other capital stock of Valero
issued in the future that ranks junior to the convertible preferred
stock;

(ii)

on a parity with any of Valero’s capital stock issued in the future
the terms of which expressly provide that it will rank on a parity with
the convertible preferred stock; and

(iii)

junior to all of Valero’s capital stock the terms of which
expressly provide that such capital stock will rank senior to the
convertible preferred stock.

The holders of the convertible preferred stock will generally be entitled to
vote with Valero common stock and not as a separate class and have a number of
votes equal to the mandatory conversion ratio that would be in effect if the
mandatory conversion date was the record date of such vote. The affirmative
vote of holders of 66-2/3% of the convertible preferred stock is necessary to
make any change to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws that would
adversely affect any power, preference or special right of the convertible
preferred stock.

Upon automatic conversion of the convertible preferred stock on July 1, 2006,
the number of shares of common stock to be received for each share of
convertible preferred stock shall be based on the average closing price of
Valero’s common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on the second
trading day prior to July 1, 2006 as follows:

•

0.6690 shares if the average closing price is less than or equal to
$37.37;



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

•

a fractional number of shares having a value of $25.00 if the
average closing price is between $37.37 and $50.45; or

•

0.4955 shares if the average closing price is greater than $50.45.

Each share of convertible preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the
holder, at any time before July 1, 2006 into 0.4955 shares of Valero common
stock. During the third quarter of 2003, Valero filed a registration statement
on Form S-3 with the SEC to register the mandatory convertible preferred stock
and the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the convertible preferred
stock. The registration statement was declared effective on October 16, 2003.

Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon conversion of the
convertible preferred stock, the number of shares of Valero common stock
included in the calculation of “earnings per common share – assuming dilution”
for each reporting period will be based on the above conversion formula using
the average closing price of Valero’s common stock over the 20-day trading
period ending on the second trading day prior to the end of the reporting
period.

Cash Dividends

On January 15, 2004, Valero’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly
cash dividend of $0.12 per common share payable March 10, 2004 to holders of
record at the close of business on February 11, 2004.

Also on January 15, 2004, Valero’s Board of Directors declared a dividend on
the mandatory convertible preferred stock of $0.125 per share payable on March
31, 2004 to holders of record on March 30, 2004.

Common Stock Offerings

On March 28, 2003, Valero sold in a public offering 6.3 million shares of its
common stock at a price of $40.25 per share and received net proceeds of $250.3
million. These shares were issued under Valero’s shelf registration statement.
The proceeds were used for repayment of borrowings under Valero’s revolving
bank credit facilities.

On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 7.8 million shares of its
common stock, which included 1.0 million shares related to an overallotment
option exercised by the underwriter, at a price of $53.25 per share and
received proceeds, net of underwriter’s discount and commissions, of $406.0
million. These shares were issued under Valero’s shelf registration statement
to partially fund the acquisition of the Aruba Refinery and related operations
discussed in Note 27 under

“Acquisition of Aruba Refinery.”

Exchange of UDS Shares

In connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero issued 45.9 million shares of
Valero common stock and vested 5.8 million employee stock options in the
exchange, which increased stockholders’ equity by a total of approximately $2.2
billion.

Common Stock Repurchase Programs

Under common stock repurchase programs approved by Valero’s Board of Directors,
Valero repurchases shares of its common stock from time to time for use in
connection with its employee benefit plans and other general corporate
purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Valero
repurchased shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of $73.2
million, $45.5 million and $156.7 million, respectively.

18. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

Commodity Price Risk

Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and
refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used
in its refining operations. To reduce the impact of this price volatility,
Valero uses derivative commodity instruments (swaps, futures and options) to
manage its exposure to:

•

changes in the fair value of a portion of its refinery feedstock
and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm
commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges);

•

changes in cash flows of certain forecasted transactions such as
forecasted feedstock purchases, natural gas purchases and refined
product sales (cash flow hedges); and

•

price volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories
and on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that
are not designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges (economic
hedges).

In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes
based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Interest Rate Risk

Valero is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to
certain of its long-term debt obligations. Interest rate swap agreements are
used to manage Valero’s fixed to floating interest rate position by converting
certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

Valero is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its
Canadian operations. To manage its exposure to these exchange rate
fluctuations, Valero uses foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts.
These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.

Current Period Disclosures

The net gain (loss) recognized in income representing the amount of hedge
ineffectiveness was as follows (in millions):

The above amounts were included in “cost of sales” in the consolidated
statements of income. No component of the derivative instruments’ gains or
losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. No amounts
were recognized in income for hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as
fair value hedges.

For cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently reported in “accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” in the consolidated balance sheets will be
reclassified into income when the forecasted transactions affect income. The
estimated amount of existing net gain included in “accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” as of December 31, 2003 that is expected to be
reclassified into income within the next 12 months is $2.8 million. As of
December 31, 2003, the maximum length of time over which Valero was hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
was one year. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, there were
no amounts reclassified from “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”
into income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting.

Market and Credit Risk

Valero’s price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of
fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to
market risk, the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an
instrument less valuable. Valero closely monitors and manages its exposure to
market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by its Board
of Directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure
compliance with Valero’s stated risk management policy. Concentrations of
customers in the refining industry may impact Valero’s overall exposure to
credit risk, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic or other conditions. Valero believes that its counterparties will be
able to satisfy their obligations under their price risk management contracts
with Valero.

19. PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

Each outstanding share of Valero’s common stock is accompanied by one preferred
share purchase right (Right). With certain exceptions, each Right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from Valero one one-



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

hundredth of a share of Valero’s Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series I
at a price of $100 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment for
certain recapitalization events.

The Rights are transferable only with the common stock until the earlier of:

(i)

10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons (Acquiring Person) has acquired
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Valero’s common stock,

(ii)

10 business days (or later date as may be determined by Valero’s
Board of Directors) following the initiation of a tender offer or
exchange offer that would result in an Acquiring Person having
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding common
stock (the earlier of the date of the occurrence of (i) or (ii) being
called the Rights Separation Date), or

(iii)

the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Rights Separation Date. At any time
prior to the acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial ownership of 15%
or more of Valero’s outstanding common stock, Valero’s Board of Directors may
redeem the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right. The Rights will expire on
June 30, 2007, unless the Rights are extended or are earlier redeemed or
exchanged by Valero.

If after the Rights Separation Date, Valero is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction, or if 50% or more of its consolidated assets
or earning power is sold, each holder of a Right will have the right to
receive, upon the exercise of the Right at its then current exercise price,
that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the
time of the transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise
price of the Right. In the event that any Acquiring Person becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding common stock, each
holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person
(which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise that number of shares of common stock having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the Right.

At any time after an Acquiring Person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of Valero’s outstanding common stock and prior to the acquisition by the
Acquiring Person of 50% or more of Valero’s outstanding common stock, Valero’s
Board of Directors may exchange the Right (other than Rights owned by the
Acquiring Person which have become void), at an exchange ratio of one share of
common stock, or one one-hundredth of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, per
Right (subject to adjustment).

Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of
Valero including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive
dividends. The Rights may have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will
cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire
Valero on terms not approved by Valero’s Board of Directors, except pursuant to
an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The
Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by Valero’s Board of Directors since the Rights may be redeemed by
Valero prior to the time that an Acquiring Person has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of Valero’s outstanding common stock.

to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income
tax assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses, state
tax credits and foreign tax credits, before they expire. The valuation
allowance is based on Valero’s estimates of taxable income in the various
jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income
tax assets will be recoverable. The realization of net deferred income tax
assets recorded as of December 31, 2003 is dependent upon Valero’s ability to
generate future taxable income in both the U.S. and Canada.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

U.S. federal deferred income taxes and Canadian withholding taxes have not been
provided for on the undistributed earnings of Valero’s Canadian subsidiaries
based on the determination that those earnings will be indefinitely reinvested.
As of December 31, 2003, the cumulative undistributed earnings of these
subsidiaries were approximately $510 million. If those earnings were not
considered indefinitely reinvested, U.S. federal deferred income taxes and
Canadian withholding taxes would have been recorded after consideration of
foreign tax credits.

Valero’s separate tax years through 1999 and UDS’s tax years through 1994, 1998
and 1999 are closed to adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service. UDS’s
separate tax years 1995 through 1997, 2000 and 2001 are currently under
examination. Valero’s separate tax years 2000 and 2001 are currently under
examination. Valero believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have
been reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

21. SEGMENT INFORMATION

Prior to the UDS Acquisition, Valero had one reportable segment, the refining
and marketing of refined products. Beginning January 1, 2002, Valero has two
reportable segments, refining and retail, because of Valero’s acquisition of
UDS on December 31, 2001, and its significant retail operations. Valero’s
refining segment includes refining operations, wholesale marketing, product
supply and distribution, and transportation operations. The retail segment
includes company-operated convenience stores, Canadian dealers/jobbers and
truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities and home heating oil operations.
Operations that are not included in either of the two reportable segments are
included in the corporate category.

The reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different
products and services. They are managed separately as each business requires
unique technology and marketing strategies. Performance is evaluated based on
operating income. Intersegment sales are generally derived from transactions
made at prevailing market rates.

22. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

Valero has several qualified non-contributory defined benefit plans (the
Qualified Plans), including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition, some of which
are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Qualified Plans cover
substantially all employees in the United States and generally provide eligible
employees with retirement income based on years of service and compensation
during specific periods. Effective March 1 and April 1, 2002, certain classes
of former UDS retail employees ceased accruing benefits under Valero’s
qualified pension plan.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Valero also has various nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans
(Supplemental Plans), including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition, which
provide additional pension benefits to executive officers and certain other
employees. The Supplemental Plans and the Qualified Plans are collectively
referred to as the Pension Plans.

In connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero approved the establishment of a
supplement to the pension plan (the 2001 Voluntary Early Retirement Window)
which permitted certain employees to retire from employment during 2002. There
were 100 employees who accepted the 2001 Voluntary Early Retirement Window
option.

Valero also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
retired employees, referred to as other postretirement benefits. Substantially
all of Valero’s employees may become eligible for these benefits if, while
still working for Valero, they either reach normal retirement age or take early
retirement. Valero offers health care benefits through a self-insured plan and
a health maintenance organization while life insurance benefits are provided
through an insurance company. Valero funds its postretirement benefits other
than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis. Individuals who became Valero
employees as a result of an acquisition by Valero became eligible for other
postretirement benefits under Valero’s plan as determined by terms of the
relevant acquisition agreement.

Valero uses December 31 as the measurement date for its Pension Plans and other
postretirement benefit plans.

The changes in benefit obligation, the changes in fair value of plan assets,

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Equity securities in the Qualified Plans include Valero common stock in the
amounts of approximately $48 million (10% of total Qualified Plan assets) and
$32 million (10% of total Qualified Plan assets) as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

The investment policies and strategies for the assets of Valero’s Qualified
Plans incorporate a well-diversified approach which is expected to earn
long-term returns from capital appreciation and a growing stream of current
income. This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and the
market value of the Qualified Plans’ assets may fluctuate from year to year.
Risk tolerance is determined based on Valero’s financial ability to withstand
risk within the investment program and the willingness to accept return
volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk parameters,
the Qualified Plans’ mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity
and fixed-income investments. Equity investments include international stocks
and a blend of domestic growth and value stocks of various sizes of
capitalization. The aggregate asset allocation is reviewed on an annual basis.

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Qualified
Plans is estimated using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are
derived using historical data given the assumption that capital markets are
informationally efficient. Three methods are used to derive the long-term
expected returns for each asset class. Since each method has distinct
advantages and disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average
of the methods’ results is used.

Although Valero has no minimum required contributions to its Pension Plans
during 2004 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Valero expects
to contribute $74.7 million to its Pension Plans and $10.7 million to its other
postretirement benefit plans during 2004.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the Pension Plans as of December 31,
2003 and 2002 was $640.3 million and $580.1 million, respectively.

The aggregate projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and

On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law a bill that expands
Medicare, primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible
retirees starting in 2006. Valero anticipates that the benefits it pays after
2006 will be lower as a result of the new Medicare provisions; however, the
retiree medical obligations and costs reported do not reflect the impact of
this legislation. As discussed in Note 1 under

“FASB Staff Position 106-1,”

deferring the recognition of the impact of the new Medicare provisions is
permitted due to unresolved questions about some of the new Medicare provisions
and a lack of authoritative accounting guidance about certain matters. The
final accounting guidance could require changes to previously reported
information. Valero believes that the adoption of the final accounting
guidance, when issued, will not result in a significant effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

Profit-Sharing/Savings Plans

Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan

Valero is the sponsor of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan, which is a
qualified employee profit-sharing plan. Participation in the Thrift Plan is
voluntary and is open to Valero employees who become eligible to participate
upon the completion of one month of continuous service. This service may
include prior employment with other companies acquired by Valero.

Through December 31, 2001, participants could make basic contributions from 2%
up to 8% of their total annual compensation. In addition, participants who
made a basic contribution of 8% could also make a supplemental contribution of
up to 14% of their total annual compensation. Valero made an employer
contribution to the Thrift Plan equal to 75% of the participant’s basic
contributions up to 8% of the base annual compensation. The Thrift Plan
provided that if Valero’s return on equity for a given year was equal to or
greater than 10%, then Valero’s employer contribution would be equal to 100% of
a participant’s basic contributions relating to the participant’s base annual
salary for the 12-month period beginning February 1 for the calendar year
following the year in which the 10% return was achieved. In January 2001, the
compensation committee of Valero’s Board of Directors approved an increase in
Valero’s employer contribution from 75% to 100% for the 12-month period
beginning February 1, 2001.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Thrift Plan was amended to provide that
participants would be able to make a supplemental contribution of up to 22% of
their total annual compensation and the maximum match by Valero



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

would be 75% of each participant’s basic contributions up to 8% based on the
participant’s total annual compensation, including overtime and cash bonuses.
However, employer contributions were equal to 100% of employee contributions up
to 8% between January 1 and February 1, 2002.

Effective December 31, 2003, the Thrift Plan was amended to exclude cash
bonuses payable for periods after
December 31, 2002, from the participant’s total annual compensation for
purposes of calculating Valero’s matching contribution.

Valero’s contributions to the Thrift Plan for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 were $24.0 million, $20.9 million and $13.5 million,
respectively.

Valero Savings Plan

In connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero became the plan sponsor of the
Valero Savings Plan (Savings Plan, formerly the UDS 401(k) Retirement Savings
Plan). The Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that previously covered
all eligible employees of UDS. Under the Savings Plan, participants can
contribute from 1% to 30% of their compensation. Effective January 1, 2002,
the company matching contributions for certain non-store employees of UDS was
changed to 75% of up to 8% of employee contributions. Effective April 1, 2002,
certain non-store employees of UDS were no longer eligible to participate in
the Savings Plan, but became eligible to participate in the Valero Energy
Corporation Thrift Plan.

Valero’s contributions to the Savings Plan for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 were $4.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively. There was no
contribution to the Savings Plan for the year ended December 31, 2001 as Valero
was not a sponsor of the plan for that year.

Stock Compensation Plans

Valero has various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans, which
are summarized as follows:

•

The 2001 Executive Stock Incentive Plan and 1997 Executive Stock
Incentive Plan (collectively, the ESIP) authorize the grant of various
stock and stock-related awards to executive officers and other key
employees. Awards available under the ESIP include options to purchase
shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the
achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock
which vests over a period determined by Valero’s compensation
committee. As of December 31, 2003, a total of 1,608,572 shares of
Valero common stock remained available to be awarded under the ESIP.

•

A non-qualified stock option plan grants options to purchase shares
of common stock to key officers, employees and prospective employees.
As of December 31, 2003, there were no shares of Valero common stock
available to be awarded under this plan.

•

The Executive Incentive Bonus Plan provides bonus compensation to
key employees based on individual contributions to company
profitability. Bonuses are payable either in cash, Valero common
stock, or both. Effective with the issuance of certain new rules by
the New York Stock Exchange in June 2003 which prohibit the issuance of
shares under plans that are not approved by a company’s shareholders,
no additional shares of Valero common stock have been or will be issued
under this plan.

•

A non-employee director stock option plan provides non-employee
directors of Valero automatic annual grants of stock options to
purchase Valero’s common stock upon their continued service on the
Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2003, a total of 100,000 shares
of Valero common stock remained available for issuance under this plan.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

•

A restricted stock plan for non-employee directors provides
non-employee directors, upon their election to the Board of Directors,
a grant of Valero’s common stock valued at $45,000 that vests in three
equal annual installments, with similar grants issued after full
vesting of prior grants. As of December 31, 2003, a total of 74,356
shares of Valero common stock remained available to be awarded under
this plan.

•

The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of
various stock and stock-related awards to employees and prospective
employees. Awards include options to purchase shares of common stock,
performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective
performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock which
vests over a period determined by Valero’s compensation committee. As
of December 31, 2003, a total of 3,431,535 shares of Valero common
stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

•

Valero GP, LLC’s 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2002 Unit Option
Plan and 2003 Employee Unit Incentive Plan provide for grants of
restricted common units of Valero L.P. and/or options to purchase common
units of Valero L.P. These restricted common unit and
option awards vest over a period determined by Valero GP, LLC’s
compensation committee. As of December 31, 2003, a total of 90,111, 37,400
and 498,560 of Valero L.P. common units
remained available to be awarded under the 2000 Long-Term Incentive
Plan, 2002 Unit Option Plan and 2003 Employee Unit Incentive Plan,
respectively.

Under the terms of the ESIP, the stock option plan, the non-employee director
stock option plan and the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the exercise price of
options granted will not be less than the fair market value of Valero’s common
stock at the date of grant. Stock options become exercisable pursuant to the
individual written agreements between Valero and the participants, usually in
three or five equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of
grant, with unexercised options generally expiring ten years from the date of
grant. Upon completion of the UDS Acquisition, all UDS stock options held by
employees and non-employee directors of UDS became vested and were converted to
Valero stock options, which had a fair value of $120 million.

23. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

Valero has long-term operating lease commitments for land, office facilities,
retail facilities and related equipment, transportation equipment, time
charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities and
various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation,
production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products.

Certain leases for production equipment and feedstock and refined product
storage facilities provide for various contingent payments based on, among
other things, throughput volumes in excess of a base amount. Certain leases
for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which vary by
charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary
based on usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums,
that are contingent on usage. Leases for convenience stores may also include
provisions for contingent rental payments based on sales volumes. In most
cases, Valero expects that in the normal course of business, its leases will be
renewed or replaced by other leases.

As of December 31, 2003, Valero’s future minimum rental payments and minimum
rentals to be received under subleases for leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as reflected in the
following table (in millions). Future lease payments as of December 31, 2003,
under structured lease arrangements are set out separately. As discussed below
under “Structured Lease Arrangements,” the leased properties under these
arrangements were purchased in March 2004 and therefore no additional lease
payments will be made under these leases subsequent to the purchase of the
properties.

Structured Lease Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, Valero had various long-term operating lease
commitments (included in the table above) that were funded through structured
lease arrangements with non-consolidated third party entities (the lessors).
These leases were for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities
and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various
facilities and equipment used in the production of refined products. The
lessors constructed or purchased the related assets and then leased them to
Valero. The assets held by these lessors were funded through equity
contributions of the lessors ranging from 3% to 5% of the fair market value of
the asset and borrowings from various financial institutions. Neither Valero,
its affiliates nor any related parties held any interest in these lessors. For
each lease, Valero had the option to purchase the leased assets at any time
during the lease term for a price that approximated fair value. As of December
31, 2003, the total amount drawn on these structured lease arrangements was
$531 million.

In the second quarter of 2003, Valero purchased TVP and certain convenience
stores, which were subject to structured lease arrangements, for approximately
$23 million and $215 million, respectively. Of the payment for the convenience
stores, approximately $127 million was recorded as an increase to “property,
plant and equipment” and approximately $88 million reduced an unfavorable lease
obligation that was recorded in conjunction with the UDS Acquisition. In
December 2003, Valero purchased OVP for $34.0 million.

In March 2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties
under each of its four remaining structured lease arrangements, and the leased
properties were purchased through borrowings under Valero’s existing bank
credit facilities.

Other Commitments

Valero has various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and
chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil
and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and
terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these contracts to ensure an
adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its refineries.
Many of Valero’s purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments
based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed
or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on Valero’s usage
requirements. The purchase obligations reflected below include
both short-term and long-term obligations as of December 31, 2003, and are
based on minimum quantities to be
purchased and/or estimated prices to be paid under the agreements based on current
market conditions. These purchase obligations are not reflected in the
consolidated balance sheets.

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

As of December 31, 2002, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with
a third-party financial institution to sell on a revolving basis up to $250
million of eligible trade and credit card receivables, which matures in October
2005. In June 2003, Valero amended its agreement to add two additional
financial institutions to the program and to increase the size of its facility
by $350 million to $600 million. Under this program, wholly owned subsidiaries
of Valero sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible
receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions.
Valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays
certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. As of
December 31, 2003, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party
financial institutions was $600 million.

Guarantees

In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business, Valero guaranteed
certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which
totaled approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2003. This lease expires
in 2010.

Contingent Earn-Out Agreements

In connection with Valero’s acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003,
the Paulsboro Refinery in 1998 and Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997, the sellers
are entitled to receive payments in any of the seven, five and ten years,
respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins
during any of those years exceed a specified level. The following table

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Valero accounts for any payments under these arrangements as an additional cost
of the respective acquisition. As of December 31, 2003, $59.3 million of the
aggregate earn-out payments had been attributed to property, plant and
equipment and is being depreciated over the remaining lives of the assets to
which the additional cost was allocated and $80.5 million had been attributed
to goodwill and is not being amortized.

24. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of
these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other
studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities
are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using
currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as
Valero’s own internal environmental policies.

The balance of and changes in the accruals for environmental matters, which are
principally included in “other long-term liabilities” described in Note 13,
were as follows (in millions):

In connection with its various acquisitions, Valero assumed several
environmental liabilities including, but not limited to, certain remediation
obligations, site restoration costs and certain liabilities relating to soil
and groundwater contamination. The additional accrual related to the UDS
Acquisition in 2002 was primarily to conform the assessment of environmental
liabilities resulting from the UDS Acquisition by utilizing the same 20-year
time period over which environmental liabilities are determined under Valero’s
policy.

In 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued to a majority of
refiners operating in the United States a series of information requests
pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act as part of an enforcement
initiative. Valero received a Section 114 information request pertaining to
all of its refineries owned at that time. Valero has completed its response to
the request. Several other refiners have reached settlements with the EPA
regarding this enforcement initiative. Though Valero has not been named in any



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

proceeding, it also has been discussing the possibility of settlement with the
EPA regarding this initiative. Based in part upon announced settlements and
evaluation of its relative position, Valero expects to incur penalties and
related expenses in connection with a potential settlement of this enforcement
initiative. Valero believes that any potential settlement penalties will be
immaterial to its financial position. However, Valero believes that any
potential settlement with the EPA in this matter will require various capital
improvements or changes in operating parameters, or both, at some or all of its
refineries which could be material in the aggregate.

Valero believes that it has adequately provided for its environmental exposures
with the accruals referred to above. These liabilities have not been reduced
by potential future recoveries from third parties. Environmental liabilities
are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors such as the
magnitude of possible contamination, the timing and extent of remediation, the
determination of Valero’s liability in proportion to other parties,
improvements in cleanup technologies, and the extent to which environmental
laws and regulations may change in the future.

25. LITIGATION MATTERS

Unocal

In 2002, Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) sued Valero alleging patent
infringement. The complaint seeks a 5.75 cent per gallon royalty on all
reformulated gasoline infringing on Unocal’s '393 and '126 patents. These
patents cover certain compositions of cleaner-burning gasoline. The complaint
seeks treble damages for Valero’s alleged willful infringement of Unocal’s
patents and Valero’s alleged conduct to induce others to infringe the patents.
In a previous lawsuit involving its '393 patent, Unocal prevailed against five
other major refiners.

In 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began an antitrust investigation
concerning Unocal’s misconduct with a joint industry research group and
regulators during the time that Unocal was prosecuting its patents at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). In 2003, the FTC filed a complaint against
Unocal for antitrust violations. The FTC’s complaint seeks an injunction
against any future '393 or '126 patent enforcement activity by Unocal. In
November 2003, an administrative law judge dismissed the FTC’s case against
Unocal, which the FTC staff appealed to the full Commission. Oral argument for
that appeal occurred on March 10, 2004.

Each of the '393 and '126 patents is being reexamined by the PTO. The PTO has
issued notices of rejection of all claims of each of these patents. These
rejections are subject to additional proceedings, including administrative
appeal by Unocal, followed by an appeal in federal district court or the court
of appeals. Ultimate invalidation would preclude Unocal from pursuing claims
based on the '393 or '126 patents.

Unocal’s patent lawsuit against Valero is indefinitely stayed as a result of
the PTO reexamination proceedings. Notwithstanding the judgment against the
other refiners in the previous litigation, Valero believes that it has several
strong defenses to Unocal’s lawsuit, including those arising from Unocal’s
misconduct, and Valero believes it will prevail in the lawsuit. However, due
to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is reasonably possible that
Valero will not prevail in the lawsuit, and an adverse result could have a
material adverse effect on Valero’s results of operations and financial
position.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

MTBE Litigation

Valero is a defendant in more than 50 cases pending in at least 15 states
alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water
providers, governmental authorities and private well owners alleging that
refiners and suppliers of gasoline containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing
or distributing a defective product. Almost all of these cases have been filed
since September 30, 2003 in anticipation of a pending federal energy bill that
may contain provisions for MTBE liability protection. Valero is named in these
suits together with many other refining industry companies. Valero is being
sued primarily as a refiner, supplier and marketer of gasoline containing MTBE.
Valero does not own or operate physical facilities in most of the states where
the suits are filed. The suits generally seek individual, unquantified
compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. Valero believes that it
has several strong defenses to these claims and intends to vigorously defend
the lawsuits. Although an adverse result in one or more of these suits is
reasonably possible (as defined in FASB Statement No. 5), Valero believes that
such an outcome in any one of these suits would not have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position. However, Valero
believes that an adverse result in all or a substantial number of these cases
could have a material adverse effect on Valero’s results of operations and
financial position.

Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final
outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or
liquidity; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the range of
possible loss, if any, cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of
precision and there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular
claim or proceeding would not have an adverse effect on Valero’s results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.

Acquisition of Aruba Refinery

On February 4, 2004, Valero executed a purchase agreement to acquire El Paso
Corporation’s 315,000 barrel-per-day refinery located on the island of Aruba in
the Caribbean Sea (Aruba Refinery), and related marine, bunkering and marketing
operations. The total purchase price for the Aruba Refinery and related
operations is $465 million plus $162 million for working capital. The working
capital amount excludes certain inventories owned by a third-party marketing
firm under an existing agreement, which Valero plans to acquire upon
termination of such agreement (which will occur on or about May 4, 2004)
for an amount estimated to be approximately $40
million based on volumes and prices as of March 4, 2004. The acquisition,
which was approved by the boards of both companies, will be financed with $200
million in cash, approximately $21 million in borrowings under existing credit
facilities, and $406 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Valero common
stock through a public offering discussed in Note 15 under

“Common Stock
Offerings.”

The additional inventory to be purchased from the third-party
marketing firm described above will be funded through borrowings under Valero’s
existing credit facilities. Closing of the transaction occurred on March 5,
2004.
