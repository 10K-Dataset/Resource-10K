ITEMS 1., 1A. and 2. BUSINESS, RISK FACTORS AND PROPERTIES

Overview

. We are a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, Texas. Our corporate offices are at
One Valero Way, San Antonio, Texas, 78249, and our telephone number is (210) 345-2000. Our common
stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VLO.” We were incorporated in
Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero Refining and Marketing Company, and our name was changed to
Valero Energy Corporation on August 1, 1997. On January 31, 2010, we had 20,920 employees.

We own 15 refineries located in the United States, Canada, and Aruba. Our refineries can produce
conventional gasolines, distillates, jet fuel, asphalt, petrochemicals, lubricants, and other
refined products as well as a slate of premium products including CBOB and RBOB


,
gasoline meeting the specifications of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), CARB diesel fuel,
low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, and oxygenates (liquid hydrocarbon compounds
containing oxygen).

We market branded and unbranded refined products on a wholesale basis in the United States and
Canada through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network. We also sell refined products through
a network of about 5,800 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States, Canada, and
Aruba.

We also own ten ethanol plants located in the Midwest with a combined ethanol production capacity
of about 1.1 billion gallons per year. Three of these facilities were acquired after December 31,
2009.

CBOB

, or “conventional blendstock for
oxygenate blending,” is conventional gasoline blendstock intended for blending
with oxygenates downstream of the refinery where it was produced. CBOB becomes
conventional gasoline after blending with oxygenates.

RBOB

is a base
unfinished reformulated gasoline mixture known as “reformulated gasoline
blendstock for oxygenate blending.” It is a specially produced reformulated
gasoline blendstock intended for blending with oxygenates downstream of the
refinery where it was produced to produce finished gasoline that meets or
exceeds U.S. emissions performance requirements for federal reformulated
gasoline.



SEGMENTS

Our business is organized into three reportable segments: refining, ethanol, and retail. Prior to
the second quarter of 2009, we had two reportable segments: refining and retail. As a result of
our acquisition of several ethanol plants during the second quarter of 2009 (as discussed in Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), we now present ethanol as a third reportable
segment. The financial information about our segments in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.

Corpus Christi East and West Refineries

. Our Corpus Christi East and West Refineries are
located on the Texas Gulf Coast along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. The West Refinery
specializes in processing primarily sour crude oil and resid into premium products such as RBOB.
The East Refinery processes heavy, high-sulfur crude oil into conventional gasoline, diesel, jet
fuel, asphalt, aromatics, and other light products. The East and West Refineries are substantially
integrated allowing for the transfer of various feedstocks and blending components between the two
refineries and the sharing of resources. The refineries typically receive and deliver feedstocks
and products by tanker and barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship
Channel. Three truck racks with a total of 16 bays



service local markets for gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, liquefied petroleum gases, and asphalt.
Finished products are distributed across the refinery docks into ships or barges, and are
transported via third-party pipelines to the Colonial, Explorer, Valley, and other major pipelines.

Port Arthur Refinery

. Our Port Arthur Refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 90
miles east of Houston. The refinery processes primarily heavy sour crude oils and other feedstocks
into conventional and premium gasoline and RBOB, as well as diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals,
petroleum coke, and sulfur. The refinery receives crude oil over marine docks and through crude
oil pipelines, and has access to the Sunoco and Oiltanking terminals at Nederland, Texas. Finished
products are distributed into the Colonial, Explorer, and TEPPCO pipelines, across the refinery
docks into ships or barges, and through a local truck rack.

St. Charles Refinery

. Our St. Charles Refinery is located approximately 15 miles from New Orleans
along the Mississippi River. The refinery processes sour crude oils and other feedstocks into
gasoline, distillates, and other light products. The refinery receives crude oil over five marine
docks and has access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port where it can receive crude oil through a
24-inch pipeline. Finished products can be shipped over these docks or through the Colonial
pipeline network for distribution to the eastern United States.

Texas City Refinery

. Our Texas City Refinery is located southeast of Houston on the Texas City
Ship Channel. The refinery processes primarily heavy sour crude oils into a wide slate of
products. The refinery receives and delivers its feedstocks and products by tanker and barge via
deepwater docking facilities along the Texas City Ship Channel and uses the Colonial, Explorer, and
TEPPCO pipelines for distribution of its products.

Houston Refinery

. Our Houston Refinery is located on the Houston Ship Channel. It processes a mix
of crude oils and low-sulfur resid into reformulated gasoline and distillates. The refinery
receives its feedstocks via tanker at deepwater docking facilities along the Houston Ship Channel
and interconnecting pipelines with the Texas City Refinery. It delivers its products through major
refined-product pipelines, including the Colonial, Explorer, Orion, and TEPPCO pipelines.

Three Rivers Refinery

. Our Three Rivers Refinery is located in South Texas between Corpus Christi
and San Antonio. It processes primarily heavy sweet and medium sour crude oils into gasoline,
distillates, and aromatics. The refinery has access to crude oil from foreign sources delivered to
the Texas Gulf Coast at Corpus Christi as well as crude oil from domestic sources through
third-party pipelines. A 70-mile pipeline with capacity of 120,000 BPD transports crude oil via
connections to the Three Rivers Refinery from Corpus Christi. The refinery distributes its refined
products primarily through pipelines owned by NuStar Energy L.P.

Aruba Refinery

. Our Aruba Refinery is located on the island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea. The
refinery has been idle since July 2009. When in operation, it processes primarily heavy sour crude
oil and produces primarily intermediate feedstocks and finished distillate products. Significant
amounts of the refinery’s intermediate feedstock production are transported and further processed
in our other refineries in the Gulf Coast, West Coast, and Northeast regions. The refinery
receives crude oil by ship at its two deepwater marine docks, which can berth ultra-large crude
carriers. The refinery’s products are delivered by ship primarily into markets in the United
States, the Caribbean, Europe, and South America.



West Coast

The following table presents the percentages of principal charges and yields (on a combined basis)
for the two refineries in this region for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total throughput
volumes for the West Coast refining region averaged approximately 266,700 BPD for the 12 months

Straits of San Francisco Bay. It processes sour crude oils into premium products, primarily CARBOB
gasoline. (CARBOB is a reformulated gasoline mixture that meets the specifications of the
California Air Resources Board when blended with ethanol.) The refinery receives crude oil
supplies via a deepwater dock that can berth large crude oil carriers and a 20-inch crude oil
pipeline connected to a southern California crude oil delivery system. Most of the refinery’s
products are distributed via the Kinder Morgan pipeline system in California.

Wilmington Refinery

. Our Wilmington Refinery is located near Los Angeles, California. The
refinery processes a blend of lower-cost heavy and high-sulfur crude oils. The refinery can
produce all of its gasoline as CARBOB gasoline and produces both ultra-low-sulfur diesel and CARB
diesel. The refinery is connected by pipeline to marine terminals and associated dock facilities
that can move and store crude oil and other feedstocks. Refined products are distributed via the
Kinder Morgan pipeline system and various third-party terminals in southern California, Nevada, and
Arizona.

Lake McKellar. It processes primarily light sweet crude oils. Almost all of its production is
light products, including regular and premium gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, and petrochemicals.
Crude oil is supplied to the refinery via the Capline pipeline and can also be received, along with
other feedstocks, via barge. The refinery’s products are distributed via truck racks at our three
product terminals, barges, and a pipeline network, including one pipeline directly to the Memphis
airport.

McKee Refinery

. Our McKee Refinery is located in the Texas Panhandle. It processes primarily
sweet crude oils and produces conventional gasoline, RBOB, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, and
asphalt. The refinery has access to crude oil from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado through
third-party pipelines. The refinery also has access at Wichita Falls, Texas to third-party
pipelines that transport crude oil from the Texas Gulf Coast and West Texas to the Mid-Continent
region. The refinery distributes its products primarily via NuStar Energy L.P.’s pipelines to
markets in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Oklahoma.

Ardmore Refinery

. Our Ardmore Refinery is located in Ardmore, Oklahoma, approximately 100 miles
south of Oklahoma City. It processes medium sour and light sweet crude oils into conventional
gasoline, ultra-low-sulfur diesel, liquefied petroleum gas products, and asphalt. Local crude oil
is gathered by TEPPCO’s crude oil gathering/trunkline systems and trucking operations, and then
transported to the refinery through NuStar Energy L.P.’s crude oil pipeline systems. Foreign,
mid-continent, and other domestic crude oils are received via third-party pipelines. Refined
products are transported to market via railcars, trucks, and the Magellan pipeline system.

Quebec City Refinery

. Our Quebec City Refinery is located in Lévis, Canada (near Quebec
City). It processes sweet crude oils and lower-quality, sweet acidic crude oils into conventional
gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, heating oil, and propane. The refinery receives crude oil
by ship at its deepwater dock on the St. Lawrence River. We charter large ice-strengthened,
double-hulled crude oil tankers that can navigate the St. Lawrence River year-round. The refinery
transports its products to its primary terminals in Quebec and Ontario primarily by train, and also
uses ships and trucks extensively throughout eastern Canada.

Paulsboro Refinery

. Our Paulsboro Refinery is located in Paulsboro, New Jersey, approximately 15
miles south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River. The refinery processes primarily sour crude
oils into a wide slate of products including gasoline, distillates, lube oil basestocks, asphalt,
lube extracts, petroleum coke, sulfur, fuel oil, propane, and butane. Feedstocks and refined
products are typically transported by tanker and barge via refinery-owned dock facilities along the
Delaware River, Buckeye’s product distribution system (into western Pennsylvania and Ohio), a
local truck rack owned by NuStar Energy L.P., railcars, and the Colonial pipeline, which allows
products to be sold into the New York Harbor market.



Feedstock Supply

Approximately 55 percent of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term
contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market. Our term
supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at market-related prices directly or
indirectly from various foreign national oil companies (including feedstocks originating in the
Middle East, Africa, Asia, Mexico, and South America) as well as international and domestic oil
companies. The term contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate
them), effective as of the next scheduled renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice
within a prescribed period of time (

e.g

., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of the current term.
The majority of the crude oil purchased under Valero’s term contracts is purchased at the
producer’s official stated price (

i.e

., the “market” price established by the seller for all
purchasers) and not at a negotiated price specific to Valero. About 75 percent of our crude oil
feedstocks under term supply agreements are imported from foreign sources and about 25 percent are
domestic. In the event we become unable to purchase crude oil from any one of these sources, we
believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available.

The U.S. network of crude oil pipelines and terminals allows us to acquire crude oil from producing
leases, domestic crude oil trading centers, and ships delivering cargoes of foreign and domestic
crude oil. Our Quebec City and Aruba Refineries rely on foreign crude oil that is delivered to the
refineries’ dock facilities by ship. We use the futures market to manage a portion of the price
risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of the delivery date and holding inventories of
crude oils and refined products.

Refining Segment Sales

Our refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk
markets. These sales include refined products that are manufactured in our refining operations as
well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of our
refineries have access to deepwater transportation facilities and interconnect with common-carrier
pipeline systems, allowing us to sell products in most major geographic regions of the United
States and eastern Canada. No customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total operating
revenues in 2009.

Wholesale Marketing

We market branded and unbranded transportation fuels on a wholesale basis in 44 states through an
extensive rack marketing network. The principal purchasers of our transportation fuels from
terminal truck racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and truck-delivered end users
throughout the United States.

The majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold to
distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero-brand family that operate approximately
4,000 branded sites. These sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multi-year
contracts. For wholesale branded sites, we promote our Valero

®

brand throughout the
United States. In addition, we offer the Beacon

®

brand in California and the
Shamrock

®

brand elsewhere in the United States.

Bulk Sales and Trading

We sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels
in domestic and international markets. Our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and
traders as well as certain bulk end-users such as railroads, airlines, and utilities. Our bulk
sales are transported primarily by pipeline, barges, and tankers to major tank farms and trading
hubs.



We also enter into refined product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements help to
minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined product availability,
broaden geographic distribution, and provide access to markets not connected to our refined product
pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by us to
unaffiliated companies at our and third parties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar
amount of refined products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase
agreements involve our purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring at
specified locations.

Specialty Products

We also sell a variety of other products produced at our refineries, which we refer to collectively
as “Specialty Products.” Our Specialty Products include asphalt, lube oils, natural gas liquids
(NGLs), petroleum coke, petrochemicals, and sulfur.



ETHANOL

We own ten ethanol plants in the Midwest with a combined ethanol production capacity of about 1.1
billion gallons per year. Our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities


that process corn
to produce ethanol and distillers grains.


We source our corn supply from local farmers
and commercial elevators. Our facilities receive corn by rail and by truck. We publish a corn bid
on our website that local farmers and cooperative dealers can use to facilitate corn supply
transactions.

After processing, the ethanol is held in storage tanks at our plant sites pending loading to truck
and rail car transportation. We sell our ethanol (i) to large customers – primarily refiners and
gasoline blenders – under term and spot contracts, and (ii) in bulk markets such as New York,
Chicago, Dallas, and the West Coast. We also use our ethanol for our own needs in blending
gasoline. We ship our dry distillers grains (DDG) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed
customers in the U.S. and Mexico, with some sales into the Far East. We also sell modified
distillers grains locally at our plant sites.

The following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants, their approximate ethanol and dry
distillers grains production capacities, and their approximate corn processing capacities.

We acquired our Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota ethanol plants in the second
quarter of 2009. Ethanol production from these seven plants in the fourth quarter of 2009 averaged
2.2 million gallons per day. We acquired our Indiana and Ohio plants in January 2010. The Indiana
and Ohio plants were idle when acquired; however, we expect production at these plants to begin by
the end of the first quarter of 2010. We acquired our Wisconsin plant in early February 2010.
This plant was producing ethanol at the time of our acquisition, and ethanol production has
continued under our ownership.

For additional information regarding these acquisitions, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Ethanol is commercially produced using
either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the
grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior
to fermentation. Our ethanol plants utilize the dry mill process, in which the
entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted
to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and
distillers grains.


In the fermentation process, nearly all of
the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the
remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) undergo a
concentration to yield modified distillers grains, or, after further drying,
dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial
replacement for corn, soybean, and dicalcium phosphate in livestock, swine, and
poultry feeds.



RETAIL

Our retail segment operations include the following:

•

sales of transportation fuels at retail stores and unattended self-service
cardlocks,

•

sales of convenience store merchandise and services in retail stores, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

We are one of the largest independent retailers of refined products in the central and southwest
United States and eastern Canada. Our retail operations are segregated geographically into two
groups: Retail – U.S. and Retail – Canada.

Retail – U.S.

Sales in Retail – U.S. represent sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise
and services through our company-operated retail sites. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
total sales of refined products through Retail – U.S.’s retail sites averaged approximately
118,600 BPD. In addition to transportation fuels, our company-operated convenience stores sell
snacks, candy, beer, fast foods, cigarettes, and fountain drinks. Our stores also offer services
such as ATM access, car wash facilities, money orders, lottery tickets, and video rentals. On
December 31, 2009, we had 991 company-operated sites in Retail – U.S. (of which 79% were owned and
21% were leased). Our company-operated stores are operated primarily under the brand name Corner
Store

®

. Transportation fuels sold in our Retail – U.S. stores are sold primarily under
the Valero

®

brand.

Retail – Canada

Sales in Retail – Canada include the following:

•

sales of refined products and convenience store merchandise through our
company-operated retail sites and cardlocks,

•

sales of refined products through sites owned by independent dealers and jobbers,
and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

Retail – Canada includes retail operations in eastern Canada where we are a major supplier of
refined products serving Quebec, Ontario, and the Atlantic Provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. For the year ended December 31, 2009, total retail sales
of refined products through Retail – Canada averaged approximately 75,200 BPD. Transportation
fuels are sold under the Ultramar

®

brand through a network of 824 outlets throughout
eastern Canada. On December 31, 2009, we owned or leased 396 retail stores in Retail – Canada and
distributed gasoline to 428 dealers and independent jobbers. In addition, Retail – Canada
operates 83 cardlocks, which are card- or key-activated, self-service, unattended stations that
allow commercial, trucking, and governmental fleets to buy transportation fuel 24 hours a day.
Retail – Canada operations also include a large home heating oil business that provides home
heating oil to approximately 142,000 households in eastern Canada. Our home heating oil business
tends to be seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter.



RISK FACTORS

Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins and global economic activity.

Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined
product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Our cost to acquire feedstocks
and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond
our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel,
and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the
availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers,
levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and
global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of
governmental regulation. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they
will continue to be volatile in the future.

Continued economic turmoil and hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could
affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Lower levels of economic activity
during periods of recession could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in
the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins
to decline and limit our future growth prospects.

Refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through
the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. Worldwide refining
capacity expansions may result in refining production capability far exceeding refined product
demand, which would have a significant adverse effect on refining margins.

A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process
crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as West
Texas Intermediate crude oil. These crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending
on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and
refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our
earnings.

Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit
and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business
partners.

Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity
factors over which we exert no control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be
restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an
impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the
cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or
illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could
have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing
them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund
assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.

We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), Moody’s
Investors Service (Moody’s), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. (Ratings from
credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should
be evaluated independently of any other rating.) We cannot provide assurance that any of our
current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.
Specifically, if S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below
investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to
attract potential investors and our



funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms
from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms
of security which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade in our credit
ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position.

From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business
could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from
financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generation with
proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter
of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available
financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. Uncertainty and illiquidity continues to exist in the
financial markets that may materially impact the ability of the participating financial
institutions to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities. In light of
these uncertainties and the volatile current market environment, we can make no assurances that we
will be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our financing facilities to
satisfy our cash requirements. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our
operations and financial position.

Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and
regulations, could adversely affect our performance.

The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and
releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive
federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the
discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures,
greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. If we
violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise
sanctioned. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new
environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those
relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (

e.g.

, California’s AB-32 “Global Warming
Solutions Act,” the U.S. House of Representatives’ “American Clean Energy and Security Act of
2009,” the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ “Clean Energy Jobs and American
Power Act of 2009,” initiatives and rulemaking following the EPA’s 2009 “Endangerment and Cause or
Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act”), the level of
expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Future legislative
action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial
actions, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs,
increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed
with certainty at this time.

Some of the proposed federal “cap-and-trade” legislation would require businesses that emit greenhouse
gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process.
In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated with the
transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United States. As a
result of such a program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell. Although it is not
possible at this time to predict the final form of a cap-and-trade bill (or whether such a bill
will be passed by Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including
a cap-and-trade program – could result in material increased compliance costs, additional
operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and
liquidity.



Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations

.

A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the
political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in,
and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were
terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that
adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be
unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil
volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations
could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or
reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.

In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with foreign
countries. These restrictions, and those of foreign governments, could limit our ability to gain
access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and
foreign countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the
future.

Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or
have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage

.

The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and
refined product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and
other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil
feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks
from company-owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have.
Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name
recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from
producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed
refining margins or feedstock shortages.

Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have.
Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our
industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy
the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.

Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to
significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or
mechanical failure, encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, be damaged by
severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be
forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings
from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through
insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. A significant interruption in one or more
of our refineries could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and
refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it
more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.

We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses arising from operating hazards.
Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could
materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results, and financial condition

.

Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry,
including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. As
protection against these



hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and
liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire
at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our
insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances,
certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For
example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes
very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully
insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Disruptions in the U.S. financial
markets have resulted in the deterioration in the financial condition of many financial
institutions, including insurance companies. We are not currently aware of any information that
would indicate that any of our insurers is unlikely to perform in the event of a covered incident.
However, in light of this uncertainty and the volatile current market environment, we can make no
assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured
events.

Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including United States, state, and foreign income
taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad
valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax
liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the
respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits
may subject us to interest and penalties.

Environmental Enforcement Matters

While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any
one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on
our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are reporting these proceedings
to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings
arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will
result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

(Paulsboro Refinery). In September 2009, the
EPA issued a proposed penalty of $211,000 in connection with an alleged unit leak of chlorinated
fluorocarbons at our Paulsboro Refinery. The EPA recently agreed to reduce the proposed penalty to
an amount less than $100,000.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)

(Benicia Refinery). We have 78 violation notices
(VNs) issued by the BAAQMD from 2007 to 2009 for various alleged air regulation and air permit
violations at our Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant. No penalties have been specified in these
VNs. We are pursuing settlement of all VNs.

Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DDNREC)

(Delaware City
Refinery). Our Delaware City Refinery is subject to 20 outstanding notices of violation (NOVs)
issued by the DDNREC. Sixteen of the NOVs allege unauthorized air emission events at the refinery.
Three NOVs allege solid waste violations. One NOV alleges violation of a wastewater permit. We
are pursuing settlement of these NOVs.

DDNREC

(Delaware City Refinery). Our Delaware City Refinery received a stipulated penalty demand
from the DDNREC in August 2009 for $200,000, and another in October 2009 for $100,000, for our
alleged failure to complete construction of a coke storage and handling system on a timely basis.
We have filed dispute resolutions at the DDNREC in connection with each of these stipulated penalty
demands, and we are negotiating with the DDNREC to resolve these matters. The refinery received a
stipulated penalty demand in October 2009 for $250,000 for our alleged failure to timely complete
construction on certain FCCU NOx controls. This penalty was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009.
In January 2010, the DDNREC demanded a quarterly stipulated penalty of $250,000 for alleged excess
NOx emissions during the three months from August to October of 2009 and an additional stipulated
penalty demand of $250,000 for alleged excess NOx emissions from November 2009 to January 2010.
Settlement discussions with the DDNREC continue on these matters.



New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)

(Paulsboro Refinery). In 2008, the NJDEP
issued three air-related Administrative Order and Notice of Civil Administrative Penalty
Assessments (Notices) to our Paulsboro Refinery that we reasonably believe may result in monetary
sanctions of $100,000 or more. The Notices allege the refinery’s failure to comply with a number
of air permit and regulatory requirements. The Notices propose penalties of approximately $780,000
in the aggregate. We are pursuing settlement of these Notices with the NJDEP.

NJDEP

(Paulsboro Refinery). In the first quarter of 2009, the NJDEP issued two Notices to our
Paulsboro Refinery. The first alleges excess air emissions at the refinery for the third quarter
of 2008, and assesses a penalty of $338,800. The other assesses a penalty of $278,800 relating to
alleged Title V permit deviations. We are pursuing settlement of these Notices.

NJDEP

(Paulsboro Refinery). In March 2009 and August 2009, the NJDEP issued Notices to our
Paulsboro Refinery. The first Notice relates to an FCC stack test conducted in 2007. The second
Notice relates to an FCC stack test conducted in February 2009. The Notices assess penalties of
$40,000 and $285,000, respectively, and direct the refinery to either perform a new stack test or
submit an application to modify the permit limits. We have commenced discussions with the NJDEP to
resolve this matter, and we continue to work with the NJDEP on additional stack testing. Appeals
and requests for a stay on both Notices have been filed. The stay on the first Notice has been
granted, and the request for stay on the second Notice has yet to be ruled on.

People of the State of Illinois, ex rel. v. The Premcor Refining Group Inc., et al.

, Third Judicial
Circuit Court, Madison County (Case No. 03-CH-00459, filed May 29, 2003) (Hartford Refinery and
terminal). The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has issued several NOVs alleging
violations of air and waste regulations at Premcor’s Hartford, Illinois terminal and closed
refinery. We are negotiating the terms of a consent order for corrective action.

South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)

(Wilmington Refinery). We have 29 outstanding
NOVs issued by the SCAQMD from 2008 to 2009 for various alleged air regulation and air permit
violations at our Wilmington Refinery and asphalt plant. No penalties have been specified in these
NOVs. We are pursuing settlement of all NOVs.

State of Ohio, Office of the Attorney General, Environmental Enforcement

(The Premcor Refining
Group Inc. former Clark Retail Enterprises, Inc. retail sites). In June 2008, the Attorney
General’s office of the State of Ohio issued a penalty demand of $11,133,000 to our wholly owned
subsidiary, The Premcor Refining Group Inc., for alleged environmental violations arising from a
predecessor’s operation or ownership of underground storage tanks at several sites. We are in
settlement discussions with the Ohio Attorney General to resolve this matter. Negotiations
continue to finalize a consent order.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)

(Corpus Christi West Refinery). In the second
quarter of 2009, the TCEQ issued a notice of enforcement (NOE) to our Corpus Christi West Refinery.
The NOE alleges excess air emissions relating to two cooling tower leaks that occurred in 2008.
The penalty demanded in the TCEQ’s Preliminary Report and Petition was $1,100,424. On July 27,
2009, we filed a response and request for hearing on this matter. Settlement discussions continue
on this matter.

TCEQ

(Corpus Christi West Refinery). We are also negotiating with the TCEQ regarding a collection
of enforcement actions pertaining to our Corpus Christi West Refinery having a potential total
penalty of $337,809. These actions collectively allege excess air emissions, reporting errors,
unauthorized tank emissions, and waste violations. Settlement discussions continue for these
matters.



TCEQ

(McKee Refinery). In August 2009, our McKee Refinery received an agreed order from the TCEQ
with a proposed administrative penalty of $469,251 for a number of self-reported Title V permit
deviations that occurred in 2008 and several emission events that occurred in 2009. We have
commenced discussions with the TCEQ to resolve this matter.

TCEQ

(Port Arthur Refinery). In October 2009, our Port Arthur Refinery received a proposed Agreed
Order from the TCEQ for $155,825 relating to alleged multiple emissions events in 2008 and early

(a)

The information presented in this table for all years excludes the results of operations
related to the Delaware City Refinery, which have been reclassified as discontinued operations
due to the shutdown of that facility on November 20, 2009. In addition, the assets related to
the Delaware City Refinery have been reclassified as assets related to discontinued operations
for all years presented herein, and as a result, the property, plant and equipment and
goodwill amounts reflected herein have changed from the amounts presented in our annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.

(b)

The information presented for 2009 includes the operations related to certain ethanol plants
acquired from VeraSun Energy Corporation (VeraSun, with the acquisition referred to as the
VeraSun Acquisition) during 2009. On April 1, 2009, we closed on the acquisition of ethanol
plants located in Charles City, Fort Dodge, and Hartley, Iowa; Aurora, South Dakota; and
Welcome, Minnesota; and through subsequent closings on April 9, 2009 and May 8, 2009, we
acquired ethanol plants in Albert City, Iowa and Albion, Nebraska.

(c)

Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky Refining Company. The results of
operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 and therefore are
not included in the statement of income information presented in this table, and the property,
plant and equipment and goodwill amounts as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 do not include
amounts applicable to the Lima Refinery.

(d)

Includes the operations related to the acquisition of Premcor Inc. beginning September 1,
2005.

(e)

Operating revenues reported for 2005 include approximately $7.8 billion related to crude oil
buy/sell arrangements.



(f)

For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the loss per common share amounts were
calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding as the effect of including common
stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in
conjunction with Items 1, 1A and 2, “Business, Risk Factors and Properties,” and Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” included in this report. In the discussions that follow,
per-share amounts include the effect of common equivalent shares for periods reflecting income from continuing

continuing operations.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
REFORM ACT OF 1995

This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “

Results of
Operations – Outlook

,” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify
our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,”
“estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,”
“could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions.

These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding:

We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections
about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition,
we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove
to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future
performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences
between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements
could result from a variety of factors, including the following:

•

acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair
our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks;

•

political and economic conditions in nations that consume refined products, including
the United States, and in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South
America;



Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future
results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate.
Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and
future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements.
We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so.

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on
our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation
to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be
made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence
of unanticipated events.



OVERVIEW

In this overview, we describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of
operations during the year ended December 31, 2009. We reported a loss from continuing operations
of $352 million, or $0.65 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss from
continuing operations of $1.0 billion, or $1.93 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The results of continuing operations for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by asset impairment losses
of $230 million ($150 million after tax), which are discussed further below, as well as a $140
million loss contingency accrual (including interest) related to our dispute of a turnover tax on
export sales and other tax matters involving the Government of Aruba. The 2008 results included a
before-tax and after-tax loss of $4.0 billion resulting from the impairment of goodwill, which is
further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, 2008
results included $86 million of pre-tax asset impairment losses ($56 million after tax) and a $305
million pre-tax gain ($170 million after tax) on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery.

In November 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery due to
financial losses caused by poor economic conditions, significant capital spending requirements, and
high operating costs. As a result of the shutdown, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion,
which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of
operations of the Delaware City Refinery, which include this loss and other asset impairment
losses, are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all
periods presented.

Due to the impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals during
2009, we continued to assess our refining segment assets for potential impairment. This evaluation
included an assessment of our operating assets as well as an evaluation of our capital projects
classified as “construction in progress.” As a result of this analysis, certain capital projects
were permanently cancelled, resulting in pre-tax write-offs of $230 million of project costs
relating to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally during 2009,
we wrote off pre-tax project costs of $178 million related to our Delaware City Refinery,
which are reported in discontinued operations as discussed above.

Also due to these poor industry conditions, in June 2009, we announced our plan to shut
down the Aruba Refinery temporarily as narrow heavy sour crude oil differentials made the refinery uneconomical
to operate. The Aruba Refinery was shut down in July 2009 and is expected to continue to be shut
down until market conditions improve.

Our profitability from our operations is substantially determined by the spread between the price
of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the “refined product margin.” The
economic slowdown that existed throughout 2009 caused a continuing weakness in demand for refined
products, which put pressure on refined product margins during 2009. This reduced demand, combined
with increased inventory levels, caused a significant decline in diesel and jet fuel margins during
2009 compared to 2008. However, gasoline margins improved in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition,
lower costs of crude oil and other feedstocks significantly improved margins on certain secondary
products, such as asphalt, fuel oils, and petroleum coke, during 2009 compared to 2008.

Because more than 60% of our total crude oil throughput generally consists of sour crude oil and
acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet
crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil
and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the “sour crude oil differential.” Sour crude oil
differentials for the year ended December 31, 2009 were substantially lower than the 2008
differentials. We believe that this decline in sour crude oil differentials was partially caused
by a reduction in sour crude oil production by OPEC and



other producers, which reduced the supply of sour crude oil and increased the price of sour crude oils
relative to sweet crude oils. In addition, high prices of residual fuel oil relative to sweet
crude oil prices caused a significant reduction in discounts realized on residual fuel oil that we
processed during 2009. These higher residual fuel oil prices also contributed to the decrease in
sour crude oil differentials because sour crude oil competes with residual fuel oil as a refinery
feedstock.

In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 10-year notes and $250 million of 30-year notes. Proceeds
from these notes were used to make $209 million of scheduled debt payments in April 2009, fund our
acquisition of certain ethanol plants from VeraSun, and maintain our capital investment program.

In April and May of 2009, we acquired seven ethanol plants and a site under development from
VeraSun for $477 million, plus $79 million primarily for inventory and certain other working
capital. The new ethanol business reported $165 million of operating income for the year ended
December 31, 2009.

In June 2009, we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock at a price of
$18.00 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other
issuance costs, of $799 million.

The following notes relate to references on pages 30 through 34.

(a)

The information presented for 2009 includes the operations related to certain ethanol plants
acquired from VeraSun during 2009. On April 1, 2009, we closed on the acquisition of ethanol
plants located in Charles City, Fort Dodge, and Hartley, Iowa; Aurora, South Dakota; and
Welcome, Minnesota; and through subsequent closings on April 9, 2009 and May 8, 2009, we
acquired ethanol plants in Albert City, Iowa and Albion, Nebraska. The ethanol production
volumes reflected for the year ended December 31, 2009 are based on 365 calendar days rather
than the actual daily production, which varied by facility.

(b)

Due to the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery during the fourth quarter of
2009, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery, as well as costs associated
with the shutdown, are reported as discontinued operations for 2009 and 2008, and all refining
operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Northeast Region, exclude the Delaware
City Refinery for both years.

(c)

Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon). The nature and
significance of our post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a
continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as
such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented
as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for
the Gulf Coast region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the year ended December 31,
2008. The pre-tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included
in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from
the per-barrel operating highlights.

(d)

The asset impairment loss for 2009 relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain
capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable
impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. Losses
resulting from the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects in 2008 have been
reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for comparability with the 2009
presentation. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment
operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the
consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel, resulting in an adjustment to the
operating costs per barrel previously reported in 2008.

(e)

Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during
the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining
segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre-tax and



after-tax goodwill
impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment
loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the
consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31,
2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods.

(f)

Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by
throughput volumes.

(g)

Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.

(h)

The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region
includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers,
Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and
Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and
Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City and Paulsboro
Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.

(i)

A loss contingency accrual of $140 million, including interest, was recorded in the third
quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the Government of Aruba regarding a turnover tax
on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual
that relates to the turnover tax of $114 million was recorded in cost of sales for the year
ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has
been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel.

(j)

The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene
and lube oil differentials and the corn crush, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene
differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the
lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent
Commodity Information Services – London Oil Reports. The
corn crush represents the posted New  York Harbor ethanol price from Oil Price Information Services less the posted corn price from the Chicago Board of Trade and
assumes a yield of 2.75 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn.
The average market reference prices and
differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with
economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability.

(k)

The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab
Light posted prices.

General

Operating revenues decreased 40% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two
periods. Operating income declined $819 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to
the amount for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to an $890 million decrease in
refining segment operating income discussed below. Despite the decline in operating income, our
income from continuing operations increased from 2008 to 2009 due to a $1.6 billion reduction in
income tax expense, largely attributable to the nondeductibility of almost all of the goodwill
impairment loss that is included in the 2008 operating income, as discussed further below.

Refining

Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $995 million for the year ended December
31, 2008 to $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating income
was attributable primarily to a $305 million gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery in the
third quarter of 2008 (as further discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements), a $143 million increase in asset impairment losses (as further discussed in Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009
related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba (as further discussed in Note 23
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a 47% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, and
an 8% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.0 billion
goodwill impairment loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 (as further discussed in Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a 16% decrease in refining operating expenses
(including depreciation and amortization expense).

Total refining throughput margins for 2009 compared to 2008 were impacted by the following factors:

•

Distillate margins in 2009 decreased significantly in all of our refining regions from
the margins in 2008. The decrease in distillate margins was primarily due to increased
inventory levels and reduced demand attributable to the global slowdown in economic
activity.



Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 22% lower for
the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a
decrease in energy costs, lower maintenance expenses, a reduction in sales and use taxes, and $43
million of operating expenses related to the Krotz Springs Refinery prior to its sale effective
July 1, 2008. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 4% from the year ended
December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the completion of new
capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization.

Retail

Retail operating income was $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $369
million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This 21% decrease was primarily due to decreased
retail fuel margins, partially offset by lower selling expenses, in our U.S. retail operations.

Ethanol

Ethanol operating income was $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which represents
the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the VeraSun Acquisition subsequent to their
acquisition in the second quarter of 2009, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased $17
million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly
due to increases in litigation costs, severance expenses, and acquisition costs, partially offset
by reductions in environmental costs and professional fees.



Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2008
primarily due to a $128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the Alon
earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments (as discussed in Notes 2, 17, and 18 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), reduced interest income resulting from lower cash
balances and interest rates, and the nonrecurrence of a $14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the
redemption of our
9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These
decreases were partially offset by a $55 million increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified
benefit plan assets and $27 million of income in 2009 resulting from the reversal of an accrual for
potential payments related to the UDS Acquisition due to the expiration of the statute of
limitations.

Interest and debt expense increased mainly due to interest incurred on $1 billion of debt issued in
March 2009.

Income tax expense decreased $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion of expense in 2008 to a $97 million
benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of
almost all of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 results of operations,
as discussed above. Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss on the effective tax rate
for 2008, our 2009 effective tax rate was lower than 2008 primarily due to a higher percentage of
the pre-tax loss being attributable to the Aruba Refinery in 2009, the profits or losses of which
are not taxed through December 31, 2010.

“Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” increased $1.5 billion from the year ended
December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the after-tax effect of the following changes
in the results of operations related to the Delaware City Refinery: (i) a $1.9
billion loss related to the permanent shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter
of 2009, (ii) a $360 million increase in asset impairment losses, and (iii) a $260 million increase
in operating losses. The shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following notes relate to references on pages 38 through 41.

(a)

Due to the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery during the fourth quarter of
2009, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery are reported as discontinued
operations for 2008 and 2007, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for
the Northeast Region, exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years.

(b)

Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon. The nature and
significance of our post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a
continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as
such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented
as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for
the Gulf Coast region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007. The pre-tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is
included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is
excluded from the per-barrel operating highlights.

(c)

Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky Refining Company (Husky).
Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery for the six months of 2007 prior to
its sale, as well as the gain on the sale of the refinery, are reported as discontinued
operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent
region, exclude the Lima Refinery. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827 million ($426
million after tax), which is included in “Income from discontinued operations, net of income
taxes” for the year ended December 31, 2007.

(d)

Losses resulting from the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects in 2008 have
been reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for comparability with the
2009 presentation. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment
operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the
consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel, resulting in an adjustment to the
operating costs per barrel previously reported in 2008.

(e)

Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during
the fourth quarter of 2008, we
determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired,
which resulted in a pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to
continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment
operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per
barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008
in order to make that information comparable between periods.

(f)

Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by
throughput volumes.



(g)

Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.

(h)

The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region
includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers,
Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and
Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and
Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City and Paulsboro
Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.

(i)

The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene
and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene
differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the
lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent
Commodity Information Services – London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and
differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with
economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability.

(j)

The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab
Light posted prices.

General

Operating revenues increased 26% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices. Offsetting the
higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs.

Operating income decreased $5.9 billion, or 89%, and income from continuing operations decreased
$5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007
primarily due to a $6.1 billion decrease in refining segment operating income. The decrease was
primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations that
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating
income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and
regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 for comparability purposes.
The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended
December 31, 2007 exclude (i) the operations of the Lima Refinery and the gain on its sale
effective July 1, 2007 and (ii) the operations of the Delaware City Refinery due to its permanent
shutdown in November 2009, which are both classified as discontinued operations as discussed in
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refining

Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $7.1 billion for the year ended December
31, 2007 to $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting mainly from the $4.0
billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above, an 11% decrease in throughput margin per barrel,
a 10% increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense),
and a 5% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $305 million
gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery effective July 1, 2008, which is discussed in Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors:

•

Distillate margins in 2008 increased in all of our refining regions from the margins in
2007. The increase in distillate margins was primarily due to strong global demand.

•

Gasoline margins decreased significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared
to the margins in 2007. The decline in gasoline margins was primarily due to a decrease in
gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production.

•

Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, propylene, and
petroleum coke declined from 2007 to 2008 as prices for these products did not increase in
proportion to the large increase in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them.



•

Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil in 2008 remained favorable and
were wider than the differentials in 2007. These favorable differentials were attributable
to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the
world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from
increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for
gasoline and diesel.

•

Throughput volumes decreased 130,000 barrels per day during 2008 compared to 2007
primarily due to a fire in the vacuum unit at our Aruba Refinery in January of 2008,
downtime for maintenance at our Port Arthur Refinery, unplanned downtime at our Port
Arthur, Texas City, St. Charles, and Houston Refineries related to Hurricanes Ike and
Gustav, the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, and economic decisions to reduce
throughputs in certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market fundamentals,
partially offset by the 2007 shutdown of our McKee Refinery discussed in Note 23 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

Throughput margin in 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee
Refinery business interruption insurance settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.61 per
barrel, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.
Operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs. Refining depreciation and
amortization expense increased 10% from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new
capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization.

Retail

Retail operating income was $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $249
million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This 48% increase in operating income was primarily
attributable to a $0.055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased in-store sales in
our U.S. retail operations. The significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of
rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense,
decreased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31,
2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined
with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a $13 million
termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P.

Other income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31,
2007 primarily due to a $91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the
repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary, reduced interest income resulting from lower cash
balances and interest rates, and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan
assets. These decreases were partially offset by income related to the Alon earn-out agreement
discussed in Notes 2, 17, and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, lower costs
incurred under our accounts receivable sales program, an increase in earnings from our equity
investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, and a $14 million gain in 2008 on the
redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities, partially
offset by higher average debt balances.



Income tax expense decreased $520 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating
income, excluding the effect on operating income of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss
discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect. Excluding this goodwill impairment loss, our
effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate
for the year ended December 31, 2007.

“Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” for the year ended December 31, 2008
represents a $119 million net loss on the operations of the Delaware City Refinery, which was
reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the permanent shutdown of the refinery
effective November 20, 2009. “Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” for the
year ended December 31, 2007 represents a $426 million after-tax gain on the sale of the Lima
Refinery effective July 1, 2007, $243 million of net income from the Lima Refinery operations prior
to its sale, and $188 million of net income from the operations of the Delaware City Refinery.

OUTLOOK

High crude oil prices in 2008 and a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009 caused a large
reduction in demand for refined products over the past two years. This demand reduction plus the
addition of new refining capacity around the world have resulted in a significant amount of excess
global refining capacity, which led to an increase in global refined product inventories and lower
refined product margins. In addition, the decrease in demand for refined products contributed to
lower production of sour crude oil versus sweet crude oil, which narrowed the differentials between
sour and sweet crude oil prices.

As 2010 progresses, we expect the United States and worldwide economies to begin to recover, and we
expect refined product demand to begin to grow accordingly. The increase in anticipated refined
product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production, which we believe will
result in the production of more sour crude oils. These expected increases in refined product
demand and sour crude oil production should result in improved refined product margins and sour
crude oil differentials. However, improvements in refined product margins and sour crude oil
differentials are expected to be significantly constrained during 2010 by the start-up of new
worldwide refining capacity that will mitigate the reduction in spare capacity that would otherwise
result from the improved demand.

Until the economy recovers and demand improves, we expect that the current low refined product
margins and sour crude oil differentials will result in production constraints or refinery
shutdowns in the refining industry. In July, we temporarily shut down our Aruba Refinery due to
poor economics resulting from the current unfavorable industry
fundamentals. The Aruba Refinery continues
 to be shut down temporarily, and it is expected to remain shut down until industry
conditions improve. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our
Delaware City Refinery. We are currently monitoring, and will continue to monitor, all of our
other refineries to assess whether complete or partial shutdown of certain of those facilities is
appropriate until conditions improve. We expect that refinery production cutbacks and shutdowns of
less profitable refineries will occur throughout the refining industry during 2010 until industry
conditions improve.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2009

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.8 billion
compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash generated from
operating activities was due primarily to the $4.4 billion decrease in operating income discussed
above under “

Results of Operations

,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss, asset



impairment losses, and gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery, all of which had no effect
on cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 billion
favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net $1.4
billion favorable effect from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable in the two
years. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables
and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and
crude oil prices at December 31, 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008.

The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2009, combined
with $998 million of proceeds from the issuance of $1 billion of notes in March 2009 as discussed
in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $799 million of net proceeds from the
issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in June 2009 as discussed in Note 14 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, $100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of
receivables, and $115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to:

•

fund $2.7 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;

•

fund the VeraSun Acquisition for $556 million;

•

make long-term note repayments of $285 million; and

•

pay common stock dividends of $324 million.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2008

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.1 billion
compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash generated from
operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under
“

Results of Operations

,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the
2008 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working
capital during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to
a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at December 31, 2008 compared to
such prices at the end of 2007. Receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the
first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the Lima Refinery to Husky and
the timing of receivable collections at year-end 2007. The change in working capital for 2007
includes a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts
receivable sales facility.

The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2008, combined
with $1.5 billion of available cash on hand and $463 million of proceeds from the sale of our Krotz
Springs Refinery, were used mainly to:

Capital Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we expended $2.3 billion for capital expenditures and $415
million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended
December 31, 2009 included $390 million of costs related to environmental projects.

For 2010, we expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments, including
approximately $1.5 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $795 million of which is for
environmental projects) and approximately $510 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs.
The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic
acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.

In January 2010, we acquired two ethanol plants from ASA Ethanol Holdings, LLC for a total purchase
price of approximately $200 million. The plants are located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg,
Ohio. In February 2010, we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin
from Renew Energy LLC for $72 million plus certain receivables and inventories.

Debt and Capital Lease Obligations

Payments for debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and
minimum rental payments, respectively.

In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 9.375% notes due March 15, 2019 and $250 million of 10.5%
notes due March 15, 2039. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $998 million, before
deducting underwriting discounts and other issuance costs of $8 million.



On April 1, 2009, we made scheduled debt repayments of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes and
$9 million related to our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds.

On October 15, 2009, we redeemed $76 million of our $100 million of 6.75% senior notes with a
maturity date of October 15, 2037 as further discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial
institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. We
amended our agreement in June 2009 to extend the maturity date to June 2010. As of December 31,
2008, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial
institutions was $100 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold additional
eligible receivables under this program of $950 million and repaid $850 million. As of December
31, 2009, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial
institutions was $200 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we have reduced the net eligible
receivables sold under this program by $100 million, resulting in a current balance of $100 million
of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions. Proceeds from
the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance
sheets.

In February 2010, we issued $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015 and $850 million of
6.125% notes due in February 2020. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled approximately
$1.24 billion, before deducting underwriting discounts of $8 million, and will be used for general
corporate purposes, including the refinancing of debt.

Also in February 2010, we called for redemption our 7.50% senior notes with a maturity date of June
15, 2015 for $294 million, or 102.5% of stated value. The redemption date will be March 15, 2010.
These notes will have a carrying amount of $296 million as of the redemption date, resulting in a
small gain on the redemption.

Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post
additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to
below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services,
the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would
increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level
as follows:

Rating Agency

Rating

Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services

BBB (negative outlook)

Moody’s Investors Service

Baa2 (negative outlook)

Fitch Ratings

BBB (negative outlook)

We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time
or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency.
We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and
may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit
ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term
financing and the cost of such financings.

Operating Lease Obligations

Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail
facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and
equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and
refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be
received by us under subleases. The operating lease



obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included
in “other long-term liabilities.”

Purchase Obligations

A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services
that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii)
fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction.
We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements
(such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and
various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an
adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries.
Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on
market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts
included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a)
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on
current market conditions. As of December 31, 2009, our short-term and long-term purchase
obligations increased by $9.3 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2008. The
increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31,
2009 compared to December 31, 2008.

Other Long-term Liabilities

Our other long-term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above,
we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information
available as of December 31, 2009.

Other Commercial Commitments

As of December 31, 2009, our committed lines of credit were as follows:

Borrowing

Capacity

Expiration

Letter of credit facility

$300 million

June 2010

Revolving credit facility

$2.4 billion

November 2012

Canadian revolving credit facility

Cdn. $115 million

December 2012

In October 2009, Aurora Bank FSB (Aurora, formerly Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB), one of the
participating banks under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, failed to fund its loan
commitment related to our borrowing under this facility. Aurora’s aggregate commitment under the
revolving credit facility was $84 million. As a result, our borrowing capacity under that
revolving credit facility was effectively reduced to $2.4 billion.

In June 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which
we may obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million to support certain of our crude oil
purchases. In June 2009, we amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to June 2010. We
are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with this letter of credit facility.

As of December 31, 2009, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities.
However, we had $259 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short-term bank
credit facilities, $299 million of letters of credit outstanding under our two U.S. committed
revolving credit facilities, and Cdn. $22 million of letters of credit outstanding under our
Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2010 and 2011.



Common Stock Offering

On June 3, 2009, we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock, which included
6 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriters, at a price of
$18.00 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other
issuance costs, of $799 million.

Stock Purchase Programs

As of December 31, 2009, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved
by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock.

Pension Plan Funded Status

During 2009, we contributed $72 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.80% discount
rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of the assets in our
qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 97% of the projected benefit obligation under
those plans as of the end of 2009.

We have less than $1 million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during 2010
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately $50
million to our Qualified Plans during 2010, of which $30 million was contributed during February
2010.

Environmental Matters

As discussed in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive
federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the
discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures,
greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates.
Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new
environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future
expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any
major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply
with environmental laws and regulations.

Currently, some of the proposed federal “cap-and-trade” legislation would require businesses that emit
greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an
auction process. In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated
with the transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United
States. As a result of such a program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell.
Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final form of a cap-and-trade bill (or
whether such a bill will be passed by Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas
emissions – including a cap-and-trade program – could result in material increased compliance
costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the
products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations, and liquidity.

Tax Matters

As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive
tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax
liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the
respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits
may subject us to interest and penalties.



Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from
the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which initially was
3% for on-island sales and services (but has subsequently been reduced to 1.5%) and 1% on export
sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. We disputed the GOA’s
assessment of the turnover tax in arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration
Institute (NAI) pursuant to which we sought to enforce our rights under a tax holiday agreement
related to the refinery and other agreements. The arbitration hearing was held on February 3-4,
2009. We also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba.

In April 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with the GOA and Caribbean Mercantile Bank NV
(CMB), pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on
exports into an escrow account with CMB, pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in
Aruba. Under this escrow agreement, we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the
disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the Aruba proceedings.
On April 20, 2009, we were notified that the Aruban tax court overruled our protests with respect
to the turnover tax assessed in January and February 2007, totaling $8 million. Under the escrow
agreement, we expensed and paid $8 million, plus $1 million of interest, to the GOA in the second
quarter of 2009. Amounts deposited under the escrow agreement, which totaled $115 million and $102 million
as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, are reflected as restricted
cash in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the turnover tax described above, the GOA
has asserted other tax amounts including approximately $35 million related to various dividends. We also
challenged approximately $35 million in foreign exchange payments made to the Central Bank of Aruba
as payments exempted under our tax holiday, as well as other reasons. Both the dividend tax and
the foreign exchange payment matters were also addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed
above.

On November 3, 2009, we received an interim First Partial Award from the NAI arbitral panel. The
panel’s ruling validated our tax holiday agreement, but the panel also ruled in favor of the GOA on
our dispute of the $35 million in foreign exchange payments previously made to the Central Bank of
Aruba. The panel’s decision did not, however, fully resolve the remaining two items in the
arbitration, the applicable dividend tax rate and the turnover tax. With respect to the dividend
tax, the panel ruled that the dividend tax was not a profit tax covered by the tax holiday
agreement, but the panel did not address the fact that Aruban companies with tax holidays are
subject to a 0% dividend withholding rate rather than the 5% rate alleged by the GOA. With respect
to the turnover tax, the panel did reject our contractual claims but it decided that our
non-contractual claims against the turnover tax merited further discussion with and review by the
panel before a final decision could be rendered. Prior to this interim decision, no expense or
liability had been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to unfunded
amounts. In light of the uncertain timing of any final resolution of these claims as a result of
the First Partial Award from the panel, we recorded a loss contingency accrual of approximately
$140 million, including interest, with respect to both the dividend and turnover taxes.

Following the November ruling, we
entered into settlement discussions with the GOA. On February 24,
2010, we signed a settlement agreement that details the parties’
proposed terms for settlement of these disputes and provides a framework for taxation of our
operations in Aruba on a go-forward basis as our tax holiday was set to expire on December 31,
2010. Under the proposed settlement, we will make a payment to the GOA of $118 million in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to the effective
date of the settlement, including the turnover tax disputed in the Netherlands Arbitration. The
GOA will eliminate the turnover tax on exports as of the effective date of the settlement. In
addition, we will agree to exit the Tax Holiday regime following the effective date of the
settlement agreement and will enter into a new tax regime under which we will be subject to a net
profit tax of less than 10% on an overall basis. Beginning on the second anniversary of the
settlement agreement’s effective date, we will also begin to make an annual prepayment of taxes of $10 million,
with the ability to carry forward any



excess tax prepayments to
future tax years. The proposed settlement will not be effective until the settlement
agreement is approved by the Aruban Parliament and certain laws and
regulations are modified and/or established to provide for the terms of the settlement. The
parties anticipate that this will occur on or before June 1, 2010. If the settlement is not
effective as of June 1, 2010, we both have the right to terminate the settlement agreement and return to arbitration and the on-island proceedings to continue litigation.

Other

Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry
and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers
may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these
customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we
believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent
necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant
problems collecting our accounts receivable.

We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from
borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect
that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or
debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit
facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future
financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit
facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial
accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial
statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and
is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical
accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction
with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant
accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered
critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates
are reasonable.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method
investments, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds
its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested
for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover
the



carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity
that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a
temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the
estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.

In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related
to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or
disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to
maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make
certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market
conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that
could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. See Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment
evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations.

Due to the effect of the current unfavorable economic conditions on the refining industry, and our
expectations of a continuation of such conditions for the near term, we will continue to monitor
both our operating assets and our capital projects for additional potential asset impairments until
conditions improve. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for
recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions, as well as changes in
assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair values and changes in potential
asset sales proceeds, could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting
our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be
reasonable. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the
impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in
the estimates.

Environmental Liabilities

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local
authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management,
and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, such as
potential cap-and-trade legislation as discussed in “

Liquidity and Capital Resources –
Environmental Matters

,” could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial
actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with
certainty at this time.

Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future
costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well
as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to
assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the
timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties.
Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new
sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their
interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and
potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for
changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.

The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.



Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are
developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including
discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost
trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control.
For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term
bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as
of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return
calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified
pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our
consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the
discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to
the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects
on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 and net periodic benefit cost for the
year ending December 31, 2010 (in millions):

Tax Liabilities

Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign
income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use,
payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in
existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the
implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax
liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from
various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential
assessments of penalty and interest amounts.

We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A
contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and
estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates.
Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different
interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In
addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred
tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be
recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount
of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets.
If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable
income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the



sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in
determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws
involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible
outcomes. See Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of
our tax liabilities.

Legal Liabilities

A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related
to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both
probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the
results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing
interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability
and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if
other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number
of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in
terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. See Note 25 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, refined product, and grain
prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In
order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use commodity derivative instruments to
hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our
unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). From time to
time, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions
such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas
purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use commodity derivative instruments that do not receive
hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery
feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product
purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are
considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income.
Finally, we enter into commodity derivative instruments based on our fundamental and technical
analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See “

Derivatives and
Hedging

” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting
for the various types of derivative transactions.

The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps,
futures, and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed
on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management
policy that has been approved by our board of directors.

The following tables provide information about our commodity derivative instruments as of December
31, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as
described below), including:

Fair Value Hedges

–
Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories (which had a carrying amount
of $4.4 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, and a fair value of $8.9 billion
and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments (

i.e.,

binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated
and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period.



Cash Flow Hedges

– Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined
product sales, and natural gas purchases. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument
designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income
and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects
income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized
in income as incurred.

Economic Hedges

– Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to:

–

manage price volatility in refinery feedstock, refined product, and grain inventories; and

–

manage price volatility in forecasted refinery feedstock, product, and grain
purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases.

In addition, through August 2009, we used economic hedges to manage price volatility in the
referenced product margins associated with the three-year earn-out agreement with Alon that
was entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, but which was
settled in the third quarter of 2009 as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. The derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value
and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in
income.

Trading Activities

– These represent commodity derivative instruments held or issued for
trading purposes. The derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are
recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are
recognized currently in income.

The following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. Contract
volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products), in billions of
British thermal units (for natural gas), or in thousands of bushels (for grain). The
weighted-average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined
products), amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas), or amounts per bushel (for
grain). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts
due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either
the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value
amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the
derivative contract volume. The pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the
fair value of the derivative contract. The pre-tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of
the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and
options, the pre-tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the
contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value
amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted-average pay price
represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted-average receive price represents
the contract price for short positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average
receive price for options represents their strike price.

INTEREST RATE RISK

In general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt
obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of
fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements
to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate
debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair
value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that
is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative
instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative
instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair
value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related
weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

We enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange
rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of
these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of
translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge.

As of December 31, 2009, we had commitments to purchase $456 million of U.S. dollars and
commitments to sell $604 million of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before February
1, 2010, resulting in a $3 million loss in the first quarter of 2010.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over
financial reporting” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) for
Valero. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of Valero’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009. In its evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework. Management believes that as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which begins on page 62 of this
report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control
– Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 26, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company’s) internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by COSO.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the consolidated balance
sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive
income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated
February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

VALERO
ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

As used in this report, the terms “Valero,” “we,” “us,” or “our” may refer to Valero Energy
Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. We are
an independent petroleum refining and marketing company and own 15 refineries with a combined total
throughput capacity as of December 31, 2009 of approximately 2.8 million barrels per day. We
market our refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and approximately
5,800 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States and eastern Canada under various
brand names including Valero

®

, Diamond Shamrock

®

, Shamrock

®

, Ultramar

®

, and Beacon

®

. We also produce ethanol, and as of
December 31, 2009, we operated seven ethanol plants in the Midwest with a combined capacity of
approximately 780 million gallons per year. Our operations are affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance
turnarounds;

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving
season and heating oil during the winter season; and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the
effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of
refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance
turnarounds.

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which
Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in significant noncontrolled entities are accounted for using the
equity method.

As discussed in Note 2, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter
of 2009. As a result, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery have been presented
as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented.
Also see Note 2 for a discussion of the presentation in the consolidated statements of income of
the results of operations of the Krotz Springs Refinery and the Lima Refinery, which were sold
effective July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2007, respectively.

The term UDS Acquisition refers to the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation (UDS) into
Valero effective December 31, 2001. The term Premcor Acquisition refers to the merger of Premcor
Inc. (Premcor) into Valero effective September 1, 2005.

We have evaluated subsequent events that occurred after December 31, 2009 through the filing of
this Form 10-K. Any material subsequent events that occurred during this time have been properly
recognized or disclosed in our financial statements.

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) “Accounting Standards Codification™” (the Codification
or ASC)

The Codification is the single source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) recognized by the FASB, to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of
authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification became effective for interim and annual
periods ending after September 15, 2009 and superseded all previously existing non-SEC accounting
and reporting standards.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in
the Codification is nonauthoritative. All of our references to GAAP now use the specific
Codification Topic or Section rather than prior accounting and reporting standards. The
Codification did not change existing GAAP and, therefore, did not affect our financial position or
results of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis,
management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and
circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments

Our temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments that have a maturity of
three months or less when acquired. Cash and temporary cash investments exclude cash that is not
available to us due to restrictions related to its use. Such amounts are segregated in the
consolidated balance sheets in restricted cash as described in Note 4.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased
for processing, refined products, and grain and ethanol inventories are determined under the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO method, with any increments valued
based on average purchase prices during the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased
for resale and the cost of materials, supplies, and convenience store merchandise are determined
principally under the weighted-average cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Additions to property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and certain costs
allocable to construction and property purchases, are recorded at cost.

The costs of minor property units (or components of property units), net of salvage value, retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation under the composite method of
depreciation. Gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are
recorded in income and are reported in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated
statements of income, except gains or losses on dispositions of certain property, plant and
equipment that are reported on a separate line item due to materiality.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the refining and retail segments is recorded
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related facilities primarily using
the composite method of depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the
ethanol segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
individual asset. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of
the related asset.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets
acquired less liabilities assumed. Intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance
(excluding financial assets). Goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 1 to 40 years. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject
to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. See Note 9.

Deferred Charges and Other Assets

“Deferred charges and other assets, net” include the following:

•

refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance activities at our refineries and which are deferred when incurred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next
turnaround occurs;

•

fixed-bed catalyst costs, representing the cost of catalyst that is changed out at
periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed
function, which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the specific catalyst;

•

investments in entities that we do not control; and

•

other noncurrent assets such as long-term investments, convenience store dealer
incentive programs, nonqualified pension plan assets, debt issuance costs, and various other costs.

We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be
able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an
earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is
other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference
between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. We believe
that the carrying amounts of our equity method investments as of December 31, 2009 are recoverable.

In November 2008, the FASB modified ASC Topic 323, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures,”
to provide guidance regarding (i) initial measurement of an equity investment, (ii) recognition of
an other-than-temporary impairment of an equity method investment, including any impairment charge
taken by the investee, and (iii) accounting for a change in ownership level or degree of influence
on an investee. These provisions were effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. These provisions apply
prospectively to equity method investments acquired after the effective date. Because we did not
acquire any equity method investments during 2009, the adoption of these provisions effective
January 1, 2009 did not affect our financial position or results of operations.

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method
investments, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not
recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value,
with fair value determined based on discounted



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

estimated net cash flows or other appropriate
methods. We believe that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2009 are
recoverable. See Note 3.

Taxes Other than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes include primarily liabilities for ad valorem, excise, sales and use,
and payroll taxes.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.

We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to the underpayment of
income taxes in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record a liability, which is referred to as an asset retirement obligation, at fair value for
the estimated cost to retire a tangible long-lived asset at the time we incur that liability, which
is generally when the asset is purchased, constructed, or leased. We record the liability when we
have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire the asset and when a reasonable estimate of the
fair value of the liability can be made. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the
liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate
the liability’s fair value.

We have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refinery assets due to various
legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of various component parts of each refinery at the time
they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate
periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and
current intent to maintain our refinery assets and continue making improvements to those assets
based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our refineries have indeterminate
lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon
which we would retire refinery assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or
range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery,
we estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair
value of that cost using established present value techniques.

We also have asset retirement obligations for the removal of underground storage tanks (USTs) for
refined products at owned and leased retail locations. There is no legal obligation to remove USTs
while they remain in service. However, environmental laws require that unused USTs be removed
within certain periods of time after the USTs no longer remain in service, usually one to two years
depending on the jurisdiction in which the USTs are located. We have estimated that USTs at our
owned retail locations will not remain in service after 25 years of use and that we will have an
obligation to remove those USTs at that time. For our leased retail locations, our lease
agreements generally require that we remove certain improvements, primarily USTs and signage, upon
termination of the lease. While our lease agreements typically contain options for multiple
renewal periods, we have not assumed that such leases will be renewed for purposes of estimating
our obligation to remove USTs and signage.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of our Canadian and Aruban operations are the Canadian dollar and the
Aruban florin, respectively. The translation of the Canadian operations into U.S. dollars is
computed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and
for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year.
Adjustments resulting from this translation are reported in other comprehensive income. The value
of the Aruban florin is fixed to the U.S. dollar at 1.79 Aruban florins to one U.S. dollar. The
translation of the Aruban operations into U.S. dollars is computed based on this fixed exchange
rate for both balance sheet and income statement accounts. As a result, there are no adjustments
resulting from this translation reported in other comprehensive income.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues for products sold by the refining, retail, and ethanol segments are recorded upon delivery
of the products to our customers, which is the point at which title to the products is transferred,
and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. Revenues for
services are recorded when the services have been provided.

We present excise taxes on sales by our U.S. retail system on a gross basis with supplemental
information regarding the amount of such taxes included in revenues provided in a footnote on the
face of the income statement. All other excise taxes are presented on a net basis in the income
statement.

We enter into certain purchase and sale arrangements with the same counterparty that are deemed to
be made in contemplation of one another. We combine these transactions and, as a result, revenues
and cost of sales are not recognized in connection with these arrangements.

We also enter into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with our
customers by accessing refined products in markets where we do not operate our own refineries.
These refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no
revenues are recorded on these transactions.

Product Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales in the
consolidated statements of income.

Environmental Matters

Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time
period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own
internal environmental policies. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been
reduced by possible recoveries from third parties.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Derivatives and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
measured at their fair values. When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a
fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading activity. The gain or loss on
a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income
in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument
designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the
hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the
cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic
hedging relationships (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for derivative
instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair
value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in
income. Income effects of commodity derivative instruments, other than certain contracts related
to an earn-out agreement discussed in Notes 2 and 17, are recorded in cost of sales while income
effects of interest rate swaps (if applicable) are recorded in interest and debt expense.

In March 2008, ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” was modified to establish disclosure
requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. The required disclosures
include qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and
disclosures about contingent features related to credit risk in derivative agreements. These
disclosures were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of these provisions of Topic 815 effective January
1, 2009 did not affect our financial position or results of operations but did result in additional
disclosures, which are provided in Note 18.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, restricted cash,
receivables, payables, debt, capital lease obligations, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign
currency derivative contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments
approximate their carrying amounts as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, except for
certain debt as discussed in Note 12. The fair values of our debt, commodity derivative contracts,
and foreign currency derivative contracts were estimated primarily based on year-end quoted market
prices and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.

In April 2009, the provisions of ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” were modified to require a
publicly traded company to include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments
for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements. We adopted these
provisions effective in the first quarter of 2009, the adoption of which did not affect our
financial position or results of operations because only disclosures were affected by the new
requirements.

Fair Value Measurements

In February 2008, ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” was modified to delay
the effective date for applying fair value measurement disclosures for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 18, 2008. The implementation
of this provision of Topic 820 for these assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009 did not
affect our financial position or results of operations but did result in additional disclosures,
which are provided in Note 17.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In August 2009, the FASB modified Topic 820 to address the measurement of liabilities at fair value
in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not
available. In such circumstances, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one
or more of the following
techniques: (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when
traded as an asset, or the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded
as assets; or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with Topic 820. The FASB also
clarified that when estimating the fair value of the liability, a reporting entity is not required
to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a
restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability. This modification also clarified that
both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the
quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no
adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements.
This guidance is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning
after issuance, the adoption of which in the fourth quarter of 2009 did not affect our financial
position or results of operations.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Earnings per common share
assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution of our outstanding stock options and nonvested
shares granted to employees in connection with our stock compensation plans. In addition, see
Notes 14 and 15 for a discussion of an accelerated share repurchase program during 2007 and its
effect on earnings per common share assuming dilution for the year ended December 31, 2007. Common
equivalent shares were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 because the effect of including such shares would be antidilutive.

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted amendments to ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share,” which
require participating share-based payment awards to be included in the computation of basic
earnings per share using the two-class method and require the restatement of prior period earnings
per share. Shares of restricted stock granted under certain of our stock-based compensation plans
represent participating share-based payment awards covered by these provisions. The adoption of
these provisions did not have any effect on the calculation of the basic loss per common share from
continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, but did reduce basic earnings
per common share from continuing operations by $0.02 per common share from the amount originally
reported that was attributable to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
calculation is provided in Note 15.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income (loss) and other gains and losses affecting
stockholders’ equity that, under GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss), including foreign
currency translation adjustments, gains and losses related to certain derivative contracts, and
gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations associated
with pension or other postretirement benefits that have not been recognized as components of net
periodic benefit cost.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for our share-based compensation plans is based on the fair value of the
awards granted and is recognized in our consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of each award. For new grants that have retirement-eligibility
provisions, we use the non-substantive vesting period approach, under which compensation cost is
recognized immediately



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or over the period from
the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if that date is expected to occur
during the nominal vesting period. Our total stock-based compensation expense recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $44 million, net of tax benefits of $24 million,
$38 million, net of tax benefits of $21 million, and $65 million, net of tax benefits of
$35 million, respectively. If we had used the non-substantive vesting period approach for awards
granted prior to January 1, 2006 (the date of the adoption of the non-substantive vesting period approach), net income (loss) would have increased by $1 million, $2 million, and $4 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

We report the effect of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation cost as a
financing cash flow, which were $5 million, $9 million, and $311 million for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Business Combinations

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the new provisions of ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,”
which address the recognition and measurement of (i) identifiable assets acquired, liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and (ii) goodwill acquired or gain from a
bargain purchase. In addition, acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the
period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. These provisions were
applied to the acquisition of certain ethanol plants from VeraSun Energy Corporation (VeraSun, with
the acquisition referred to as the VeraSun Acquisition) in the second quarter of 2009, which is
discussed in Note 2.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

In December 2008, the FASB modified ASC Topic 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits,” to require
enhanced disclosures regarding (i) investment policies and strategies, (ii) categories of plan
assets, (iii) fair value measurements of plan assets, and (iv) significant concentrations of risk.
These disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, with earlier
application permitted. See Note 21 for the additional disclosures required by this accounting
pronouncement. Since only disclosures are affected by these requirements, the adoption of these
provisions effective December 31, 2009 did not affect our financial position or results of
operations.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” was modified to provide guidance for the
accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests, changes in controlling interests, and the
deconsolidation of subsidiaries. In addition, this modification provided that an entity shall
disclose pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share if an entity has one or more
noncontrolling interests. The adoption of these provisions of Topic 810 effective January 1, 2009
did not affect our financial position or results of operations.

Subsequent Events

In May 2009, ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events,” was issued, which established general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, guidance was
provided regarding (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a
reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements, (ii) the circumstances under which an entity should
recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial
statements, and (iii) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

transactions that
occur after the balance sheet date. The provisions of Topic 855 are to be applied prospectively
and are effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption
of the provisions of Topic 855 in the second quarter of 2009 did not affect our financial position
or results of operations but did result in additional disclosures, which are provided above under
“

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation.”

New Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Statement No. 166

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets – an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.” According to ASC Topic 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles,” Statement No. 166 shall continue to represent authoritative guidance until it is
integrated into the Codification. Statement No. 166 amends and clarifies provisions related to the
transfer of financial assets in order to address application and disclosure issues. In general,
Statement No. 166 clarifies the requirements for derecognizing transferred financial assets,
removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and related exceptions, and requires
additional disclosures related to transfers of financial assets. Statement No. 166 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009,
and earlier application is prohibited. The adoption of Statement No. 166 effective January 1, 2010
has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

FASB Statement No. 167

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).”
According to ASC Topic 105, Statement No. 167 shall continue to represent authoritative guidance
until it is integrated into the Codification. Statement No. 167 amends provisions related to
variable interest entities to include entities previously considered qualifying special-purpose
entities, as the concept of these entities was eliminated by Statement No. 166. This statement
also clarifies consolidation requirements and expands disclosure requirements related to variable
interest entities. Statement No. 167 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, and earlier application is prohibited. The
adoption of Statement No. 167 effective January 1, 2010 has not had a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

In January 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 820 were modified to require additional disclosures,
including transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the gross basis
presentation of the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures
related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2010 (including interim periods). Early adoption is permitted. We have adopted all
of these provisions of ASC Topic 820 effective December 31, 2009. Since only disclosures are
affected by these requirements, the adoption of these provisions did not affect our financial
position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts for 2008 and 2007 that were previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2008 have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation.
Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and our consolidated statements of income
for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 have been reclassified to present the assets,
liabilities, and operations of the Delaware City Refinery as discontinued operations. In addition,
asset impairment losses



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(discussed in Note 3) have been presented on a separate line in the 2009
consolidated statement of income due to the materiality of the amount in 2009. For comparability
with this presentation, asset impairment losses resulting from the cancellation of certain capital
projects classified as “construction in progress” for the year ended December 31, 2008 have been
reclassified from operating expenses and reflected on a separate line. The asset impairment losses
are also presented on a separate line in the consolidated statements of cash flows, which resulted
in an adjustment to capital expenditures previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2008.

2. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, AND PERMANENT PLANT CLOSURE

Shutdown of Delaware City Refinery

On November 20, 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery due to
financial losses caused by poor economic conditions, significant capital spending requirements, and
high operating costs. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion,
of which $1.4 billion represented the write-down of the book value of the refinery assets to net
realizable value (see discussion in Note 3 below). The remaining loss was comprised primarily of
$132 million related to the recognition of previously deferred losses on cash flow hedges that were
discontinued due to the shutdown (see Note 18), $95 million of asset retirement obligations,
$81 million of cancelled capital projects, $56 million of contract cancellation costs, and
$47 million of employee termination costs. In addition to the loss resulting from the permanent
shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery for
2009 also included $377 million of other pre-tax asset impairment losses, including both operating
assets and projects in progress as further discussed in Note 3, and $393 million of pre-tax losses
from operations. During 2008, the Delaware City Refinery incurred a pre-tax loss of $190 million,
comprised of $132 million of operating losses, $41 million of goodwill impairment loss, and
$17 million of asset impairment losses. The consolidated statements of income reflect the
operations related to the Delaware City Refinery in “income (loss) from discontinued operations,
net of income taxes” for all periods presented. The remaining carrying amount of the Delaware City
Refinery assets as of December 31, 2009 is immaterial.

Acquisition of VeraSun Assets

In the second quarter of 2009, we acquired seven ethanol plants and a site under development from
VeraSun. Because VeraSun was subject to bankruptcy proceedings and different lenders were involved
with various plants, three separate closings were required to consummate the acquisition of these
ethanol plants. On April 1, 2009, we closed on the acquisition of ethanol plants located in
Charles City, Fort Dodge, and Hartley, Iowa; Aurora, South Dakota; and Welcome, Minnesota, and a
site under development located in Reynolds, Indiana for consideration of $350 million. Through
subsequent closings on April 9, 2009 and May 8, 2009, we acquired VeraSun’s ethanol plant in Albert
City, Iowa, for consideration of $72 million and VeraSun’s ethanol plant in Albion, Nebraska, for
consideration of $55 million, respectively. In conjunction with the acquisition of the seven
ethanol plants, we also paid $79 million primarily for inventory and certain other working capital.
We have elected to use the LIFO method of accounting for the commodity inventories related to the
acquired ethanol business. We incurred approximately $10 million of acquisition-related costs that
were recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income for
the year ended December 31, 2009.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The acquired ethanol business involves the production and marketing of ethanol and its co-products,
including distillers grains. The ethanol operations are reflected as a reportable segment in
Note 20, the operations of which complement our existing clean motor fuels business. The
acquisition cost was
funded with part of the proceeds from a $1 billion issuance of notes in March 2009, which is
discussed in Note 12.

An independent appraisal of the assets acquired in the VeraSun Acquisition was completed, and the

Sale of Krotz Springs Refinery

Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana to Alon Refining Krotz
Springs, Inc. (Alon), a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy, Inc. The nature and significance of our
post-closing



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of
activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of
operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations
in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Under the
offtake agreement, we agreed to (i) purchase all refined products from the Krotz Springs Refinery
for three months after the effective date of the sale, (ii) purchase certain products for an
additional one to five years after the expiration of the initial three-month period of the
agreement, and (iii) provide certain refined products to Alon that are not
produced at the Krotz Springs Refinery for an initial term of 15 months and thereafter until
terminated by either party.

The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $305 million ($170 million after tax), which is presented as
a separate line item in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Cash proceeds, net of certain costs related to the sale, were $463 million, including approximately
$135 million from the sale of working capital to Alon primarily related to the sale of inventory by
our marketing and supply subsidiary.

In addition to the cash consideration received, we also received contingent consideration in the
form of a three-year earn-out agreement based on certain product margins. This earn-out agreement
qualified as a derivative contract and had a fair value of $171 million as of July 1, 2008. We
hedged the risk of a decline in the referenced product margins by entering into certain commodity
derivative contracts. On August 27, 2009, we settled the earn-out agreement with Alon for
$35 million, of which $18 million was received on the settlement date and the remaining amount will
be received in eight payments of $2.2 million each quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009.
In connection with the settlement of the earn-out agreement, we effectively closed our positions
in the related commodity derivative contracts during the third quarter of 2009, as a result of
which we locked in $175 million of cash proceeds on those contracts, approximately $105 million of
which was received as of December 31, 2009 with the remaining proceeds to be received in varying
monthly amounts through July 2011. As such, the total amount earned on the Alon earn-out
agreement, including the related commodity derivative contracts, was $210 million.

Proceeds from the sale were approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $550 million from
the sale of working capital to Husky primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing
and supply subsidiary. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after
tax, which is included as a part of the reported income from discontinued operations in the
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Minor Acquisitions

In June 2009, we purchased the Trans-Texas Pipeline, the Wynnewood Pipeline, and their related tank
and storage facilities from NuStar Logistics, L.P. for $29 million. These assets provide
transportation and storage services for moving refined products from our McKee Refinery to Mont
Belvieu, Texas, and from our Ardmore Refinery to the Magellan pipeline system in the Midwest.

In August 2008, we purchased 70 convenience stores and fueling kiosks from Albertson’s LLC for
$87 million, including $4 million for inventory. These retail sites, which are located in Texas,
Colorado, Arizona, and Louisiana, enhance our existing retail network and supply chain.

In February 2008, we purchased ConocoPhillips’ one-third undivided joint interest in a refined
product pipeline and terminal for $57 million. These assets provide transportation and storage
services for moving refined products from our McKee Refinery to markets in El Paso, Texas and
Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.

Subsequent Acquisition of Additional Ethanol Plants

In December 2009, we signed an agreement with ASA Ethanol Holdings, LLC (ASA) to buy two ethanol
plants that had been previously owned by VeraSun. The two plants are located in Linden, Indiana
and Bloomingburg, Ohio. In December 2009, we made a $20 million advance payment towards the
purchase of these facilities, and in January 2010, we completed the acquisition for a total
purchase price of approximately $200 million.

Also in December 2009, we received approval from a bankruptcy court to acquire an ethanol facility
located near Jefferson, Wisconsin from Renew Energy LLC for $72 million plus certain receivables
and inventories. In December 2009, we made a $1 million advance payment towards the purchase of
this facility. We completed this acquisition on February 4, 2010.

3. IMPAIRMENTS

Goodwill Impairment

As shown in Note 9, as of December 31, 2007, we had goodwill with a balance of $4.0 billion. All
of our goodwill was allocated among four reporting units that comprise the refining segment. These
reporting units are the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Northeast, and West Coast refining regions. Our
annual test for impairment of goodwill was historically performed as of October 1 of each year.
However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, there were severe disruptions in the capital and
commodities markets that contributed to a significant decline in our common stock price. As a
result, our equity market capitalization fell significantly below our net book value. Because this
situation is an indicator that goodwill may be impaired, we performed an additional analysis to
evaluate the potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2008. Based on this
additional analysis, we determined that all of the goodwill in our four reporting units was
impaired, which resulted in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss of $4.1 billion
($4.0 billion after tax), of which $41 million ($40 million after tax) was attributed to the
Delaware City Refinery and therefore reclassified to discontinued operations. For purposes of this
goodwill impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated based on the present
value of expected future cash flows, with the present value determined using discount rates that
reflected the risk inherent in the assets and risk premiums that reflected the volatility in the
industry and the financial markets.

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment, Excluding Capital Projects

Due to the adverse changes in market conditions during 2008 discussed under “

Goodwill Impairment

”
above, we also evaluated our significant operating assets for potential impairment as of
December 31, 2008, and we determined that the carrying amount of each of these assets was
recoverable. However, the economic slowdown that began in 2008 continued throughout 2009, thereby
impacting demand for refined products and putting significant pressure on refined product margins.
Due to these economic conditions, in June 2009, we announced our plan to shut down the
Aruba Refinery temporarily as narrow heavy sour crude oil differentials made the refinery uneconomical to
operate. The Aruba Refinery was shut down in July 2009 and is expected to continue to be shut down
until market conditions improve. We are continuing to evaluate potential alternatives for this
refinery, which may include the sale of the refinery. In addition, we
have negotiated a
settlement of various tax disputes with the Government of Aruba
(GOA), which will be presented to the Aruban Parliament for approval
and implementation. The outcome of this agreement could
have a significant impact on the future economics of this refinery (see Note 23). As of
December 31, 2009, the Aruba Refinery had a net book value of approximately $1.0 billion.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In September 2009, we announced the shutdown of our coker and gasification units at our Delaware
City Refinery also due to economic reasons. The coker unit was expected to remain shut down until
economics improved and the gasification unit was permanently shut down. As a result, we recorded a
pre-tax loss of approximately $280 million in the third quarter of 2009 related to the abandonment
of that unit. In November 2009, our board of directors approved a plan to permanently shut down
our Delaware City Refinery due to its financial losses caused by poor economic conditions,
significant capital spending requirements, and high operating costs. Due to the permanent shutdown
of the Delaware City Refinery, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.4 billion related to the write-down
of depreciable property, plant and equipment to its net realizable value and the write-off of the
remaining balance of deferred turnaround and catalyst costs (see discussion in Note 2 above).

As a result of the above factors, we readdressed the potential impairment of all of our facilities
(excluding the Delaware City Refinery assets) as of December 31, 2009 based on an assumption that
we would operate these facilities in the future, incorporating updated price assumptions into our
future estimated undiscounted cash flows. In addition, we considered the probability of any asset
sale proceeds related to
potential sales scenarios that existed as of December 31, 2009. Based on our analysis, we
determined that the carrying amount of each of our significant operating assets continued to be
recoverable as of December 31, 2009. Our analysis, as it relates to our Aruba and Paulsboro
Refineries, did not indicate impairment. However, the expected future cash flows from these
refineries did not exceed their respective net book values by a large amount. As such, future
unfavorable price assumption changes or an increase in the likelihood of a potential sale could
result in a significant write-down of these assets.

During 2010, management intends to evaluate strategic alternatives for our Paulsboro Refinery.
These alternatives could include a temporary shutdown, alternative processing configurations and
arrangements, or a possible sale. The net book value of the Paulsboro Refinery was approximately
$1.3 billion as of December 31, 2009.

Capital Project Write-offs

Due to the impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals, we further
evaluated all of our capital projects classified as “construction in progress” during 2009. This
was a continuation of an ongoing process that had commenced during the second half of 2008. As a
result of this assessment, certain additional capital projects were permanently cancelled,
resulting in write-offs of $408 million of project costs for the year ended December 31, 2009.
This amount includes $178 million of project costs related to our Delaware City Refinery
($81 million of which was included in the $1.9 billion shutdown loss discussed in Note 2), the
write-off of which is reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we wrote off $103 million of capital projects (including
$17 million related to the Delaware City Refinery that is reported as discontinued operations), the
amount of which has been reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for
comparability with the 2009 presentation.

In addition to capital projects that have been written off, we have also suspended construction
activity on various other projects. For example, our two hydrocracker projects on the Gulf Coast,
one at the St. Charles Refinery and the other at the Port Arthur Refinery, have been temporarily
suspended until market conditions and cash flows improve. As of December 31, 2009, approximately
$1.1 billion of costs had been incurred on these two projects. In addition, various other projects
with a total cost of approximately $600 million as of December 31, 2009 have also been temporarily

discussed above, and the  costs incurred to date have not been written off.
We believe that the overall market conditions and our cash flows will improve in the future such
that the completion and recoverability of these temporarily suspended projects is probable.

Effect of Impairment Assumptions

Due to the effect of the current unfavorable economic conditions on the refining industry, and our
expectations of a continuation of such conditions for the near term, we will continue to monitor
both our operating assets and our capital projects for additional potential asset impairments until
conditions improve. The determination of future cash flows requires us to make significant
estimates and assumptions about the future operations of our refineries, including overall
throughput volumes, types of crude oil processed, types of products produced, and prices for crude
oil and refined products. Prices for crude oil and refined products fluctuate significantly based
on market factors, as well as geopolitical matters. Prices, in turn, impact refinery throughput
assumptions. We believe that our estimates are reasonable; however, future cash flows will differ
from our estimates and such differences may be material.

The sensitivity of our estimates is most significant with respect to the Aruba Refinery and the
Paulsboro Refinery. As discussed above, we temporarily shut down the Aruba Refinery in July 2009.
Our cash flow estimates assume that this refinery will restart in 2011 due to our expectation of
improved prices
resulting from an expected improvement in the worldwide economy. We have also assumed a high
probability of a settlement with the GOA on our outstanding tax disputes. Should prices fail to
improve as expected or other factors occur that result in our decision not to restart the refinery
when expected, we may determine that the Aruba Refinery is impaired, and the resulting impairment
loss could be material to our results of operations. With respect to the Paulsboro Refinery, the
refinery’s expected future cash flows are primarily sensitive to differences between expected and
actual refined product prices. In addition, future developments from our evaluation of strategic
alternatives for the Paulsboro Refinery (including a potential sale) could significantly impact our
asset impairment assumptions. Should we determine that the Paulsboro Refinery is impaired, the
resulting impairment loss could be material to our results of operations.

Bank Credit Facilities

We have a revolving credit facility (the Revolver) that has a maturity date of November 2012. As
of December 31, 2008, the Revolver had a borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion. In October 2009,
Aurora Bank FSB (Aurora, formerly Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB), one of the participating banks under
the Revolver, failed to fund its loan commitment related to our borrowing under this facility.
Aurora’s aggregate commitment under the Revolver was $84 million. As a result, our borrowing
capacity under the Revolver has been effectively reduced to $2.4 billion. Borrowings under the
Revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, or an alternate base rate as defined under the
agreement. We are also being charged various fees and expenses in connection with the Revolver,
including facility fees and letter of credit fees. The interest rate and fees under the Revolver
are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to our non-bank debt. The
Revolver also includes certain restrictive covenants including a debt-to-capitalization ratio.

During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we borrowed and repaid $39 million and
$296 million, respectively, under the Revolver. There were no borrowings under the Revolver during
the year ended December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were no borrowings
outstanding under the Revolver and letters of credit outstanding under this committed facility
totaled $104 million and $199 million, respectively.

In addition to the Revolver, one of our Canadian subsidiaries has a committed revolving credit
facility under which it may borrow and obtain letters of credit up to Cdn. $115 million. In
December 2007, the Canadian credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date from December
2010 to December 2012. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under
our Canadian credit facility and letters of credit issued under this credit facility totaled
Cdn. $22 million and Cdn. $19 million, respectively.

In June 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which
we may obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million to support certain of our crude oil
purchases. In June 2009, we amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to June 2010. We
are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with this letter of credit facility.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $195 million and $150 million, respectively, of
outstanding letters of credit issued under this revolving credit facility.

In July 2008, we entered into a one-year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which
we could obtain letters of credit of up to $275 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had
$82 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under this credit facility. This credit
facility expired in July 2009.

We also have various uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009 and
2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities;
however, there were $259 million and $201 million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding
under such facilities for which we are charged letter of credit issuance fees. The uncommitted
credit facilities have no commitment fees or compensating balance requirements.

During April 2007, we borrowed $3 billion under a 364-day term credit agreement with a financial
institution to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed in Note 14. The term loan
bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin, or an alternate base rate as defined under the term credit
agreement. In May 2007, we repaid $500 million of the borrowings under the term credit agreement.
The remaining

balance of $2.5 billion was repaid in June 2007 using available cash and proceeds
from our issuance of long-term notes in June 2007 described below.

Non-Bank Debt

In February 2007, we redeemed our 9.25% senior notes for $183 million, or 104.625% of stated value.
These notes had a carrying amount of $187 million on the date of redemption, resulting in a gain
of $4 million that was included in “other income, net” in the consolidated statement of income. In
addition, we made scheduled debt repayments of $230 million in April 2007 related to our 6.125%
notes and $50 million in November 2007 related to our 6.311% CORE notes.

In June 2007, we issued $750 million of 6.125% notes due June 15, 2017 and $1.5 billion of 6.625%
notes due June 15, 2037. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $2.245 billion, before
deducting underwriting discounts of $18 million.

On February 1, 2008, we redeemed our 9.50% senior notes for $367 million, or 104.75% of stated
value. These notes had a carrying amount of $381 million on the date of redemption, resulting in a
gain of $14 million that was included in “other income, net” in the consolidated statement of
income. In addition, in March 2008, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $7 million related to
certain of our other debt.

In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 9.375% notes due March 15, 2019 and $250 million of 10.5%
notes due March 15, 2039. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $998 million, before
deducting underwriting discounts and other issuance costs of $8 million.

On April 1, 2009, we made scheduled debt repayments of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes and
$9 million related to our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds.

Under the indenture related to our $100 million of 6.75% senior notes with a maturity date of
October 15, 2037, on July 31, 2009, we notified the holders of such notes of our obligation to
purchase any of those notes for which a written notice of purchase (purchase notice) was received
from the holders prior to September 15, 2009. A purchase notice was received related to
$76 million of the outstanding notes, which resulted in a charge of $6 million in the third quarter
of 2009 to write off a pro rata portion of unamortized fair value adjustment. We redeemed the
$76 million of notes at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to
October 15, 2009, the date of the payment of the purchase price.

In February 2010, we issued $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015 and $850 million of
6.125% notes due in February 2020. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled approximately
$1.24 billion, before deducting underwriting discounts of $8 million, and will be used for general
corporate purposes, including the refinancing of debt.

Also in February 2010, we called for redemption our 7.50% senior notes with a maturity date of
June 15, 2015 for $294 million, or 102.5% of stated value. The redemption date will be March 15,
2010. These notes will have a carrying amount of $296 million as of the redemption date, resulting
in a small gain on the redemption.

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial
institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. In June
2009, we amended the agreement to extend the maturity date to June 2010. We use this program as a
source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our marketing subsidiaries (Valero
Marketing) sells eligible receivables, without recourse, to another of our subsidiaries (Valero
Capital), whereupon the receivables are no longer owned by Valero Marketing. Valero Capital, in
turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without
recourse, to the third-party entities and financial
institutions. To the extent that Valero Capital retains an ownership interest in the receivables
it has purchased from Valero Marketing, such interest is included in our consolidated financial
statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of Valero Capital
with those of Valero Energy Corporation; the receivables are not available to satisfy the claims of
the creditors of Valero Marketing or Valero Energy Corporation.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of our accounts
receivable composed the designated pool of accounts receivable included in the program. The amount
of eligible receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial institutions was
$200 million and $100 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Proceeds from the
sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheets
and is presented as “other debt” in the table of debt and capital leases at the beginning of this
Note 12. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold additional eligible receivables under
this program of $950 million and repaid $850 million.

We remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the third-party entities and financial
institutions and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. The costs
we incurred related to this facility were $8 million, $6 million, and $40 million for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from collections under this
facility of $5.5 billion, $3.3 billion, and $19.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008, and 2007, respectively, were reinvested in the program by the third-party entities and
financial institutions. However, the third-party entities’ and financial institutions’ interests
in our accounts receivable were never in excess of the sales facility limits at any time under this
program. No accounts receivable included in this program were written off during 2009, 2008, or
2007.

On April 25, 2007, our board of directors approved an amendment to our pre-existing $2 billion
common stock purchase program to increase the authorized purchases under the program to $6 billion.
Stock purchases under the program are made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by

factors. The program does not have a scheduled expiration date.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In conjunction with the increase in our common stock purchase program, we entered into an agreement
with a financial institution to purchase $3 billion of our shares under an accelerated share
repurchase program, and in late April 2007, 42.1 million shares were purchased under this
agreement. As described in Note 12 above, the purchase of these shares was initially funded with a
364-day term credit agreement, which we subsequently replaced with longer-term financing. The cost
of the shares purchased under this accelerated share repurchase program was to be adjusted at the
expiration of the program, with the final purchase cost based on a discount to the average trading
price of our common stock, weighted by the
daily volume of shares traded, during the program period. Any adjustment to the cost could be paid
in cash or stock, at our option.

The accelerated share repurchase program was completed on July 23, 2007, and we elected to pay in
cash an additional $94 million for the shares purchased. This cash payment was deducted from
reported income from continuing operations in calculating earnings per common share from continuing
operations assuming dilution for the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 15).

On February 28, 2008, our board of directors approved a $3 billion common stock purchase program,
which is in addition to the remaining amount under the $6 billion program previously authorized.
This additional $3 billion program has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2009, we had made no
purchases of our common stock under this $3 billion program. As of December 31, 2009, we have
approvals under these stock purchase programs to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common
stock.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we purchased 0.2 million, 23.0 million,
and 84.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at a cost of $4 million, $955 million,
and $5.8 billion, respectively. These purchases were made in connection with the administration of
our employee benefit plans and the $6 billion common stock purchase program authorized by our board
of directors, including the effect of the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above.
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we issued 2.7 million, 2.5 million, and
16.1 million shares from treasury, respectively, for our employee benefit plans.

Common Stock Dividends

On January 26, 2010, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common
share payable March 17, 2010 to holders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2010.

In addition to the change in earnings (loss) per common share from continuing
operations resulting from the reclassification of the results of operations of the Delaware
City Refinery as discontinued operations, the basic earnings per common share amount for the
year ended December 31, 2007 decreased by $0.02 per share from the amount originally reported
as a result of the adoption of certain modifications that require our restricted stock to be
treated as a participating security in calculating basic earnings per common share effective
January 1, 2009, as

effect on the basic loss per common share originally reported for the year ended December 31,
2008.

Common equivalent shares were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 because the effect of including such shares would
be antidilutive.

The following table reflects potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the
calculation of “earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations – assuming dilution” as
the effect of including such securities would have been antidilutive (in millions). For the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, common equivalent shares, which represent primarily stock
options, were excluded as a result of the net losses reported for 2009 and 2008. In addition, for
all years, certain stock option amounts presented below were excluded, representing outstanding
stock options for which the exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares during each respective reporting period.

•

amounts accrued for capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and
contingent earn-out payments are reflected in investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows when such amounts are paid;

•

amounts accrued for common stock purchases in the open market that are not settled as of
the balance sheet date are reflected in financing activities in the consolidated statements
of cash flows when the purchases are settled and paid;

•

changes in assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations of the Delaware
City Refinery prior to its shutdown are reflected in the line items to which the changes
relate in the table above;

•

changes in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale
pertaining to the operations of the Krotz Springs Refinery and the Lima Refinery prior to
their sales are reflected in the line items to which the changes relate in the table above;
and

•

certain differences between consolidated balance sheet changes and consolidated
statement of cash flow changes reflected above result from translating foreign currency
denominated amounts at different exchange rates.

There were no significant noncash investing or financing activities for the year ended December 31,
2009. Noncash investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 included the contingent
consideration received in the form of the earn-out agreement related to the sale of the Krotz
Springs Refinery discussed in Note 2. Noncash investing activities for the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 included adjustments to goodwill and certain noncurrent liabilities
resulting from adjustments to the purchase price allocations related to the Premcor and UDS
Acquisitions (as discussed in Note 9).

17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

A fair value hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3) is used to categorize fair value amounts
based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. Accordingly, fair values determined by
Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair
values determined by Level 2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include
situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. We use
appropriate valuation techniques based on the available inputs to measure the fair values of our
applicable assets and liabilities. When available, we measure fair value using Level 1 inputs
because they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.

The tables below present information (dollars in millions) about our financial assets and
liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value
hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of December 31, 2009 and
2008.

The valuation methods used to measure our financial instruments at fair value are as follows:

•

Commodity derivative contracts, consisting primarily of exchange-traded futures and
swaps, are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are
valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and
exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but
since they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures
instruments with a comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

The nonqualified benefit plan assets and certain nonqualified benefit plan liabilities categorized in Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from national security exchanges. The
nonqualified benefit plan assets categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair
values of which are provided by the insurer.

•

The Alon earn-out agreement, which we received as partial consideration for the sale of
our Krotz Springs Refinery in July 2008, was measured at fair value using a discounted cash
flow model and was categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy through July 2009.
Significant inputs to the model included expected payments and discount rates that
considered the effects of both credit risk and the time value of money. On August 27,
2009, we settled the Alon earn-out agreement as discussed in Note 2. We have elected not
to apply the fair value option to this settlement receivable.

Cash received from brokers of $64 million, resulting from the equity in broker accounts covered by
master netting arrangements exceeding the minimum margin requirements for such accounts, is netted
against the fair value of the commodity derivatives reflected in Level 1. Certain of our commodity
derivative contracts under master netting arrangements include both asset and liability positions.
We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative
instruments executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral asset or
obligation.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances (in millions) for fair value
measurements developed using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008.

income, net” of losses and gains on derivative instruments entered into to hedge the risk of
changes in the fair value of the Alon earn-out agreement. The derivative instruments used to hedge
the Alon earn-out agreement prior to the settlement are included in the “commodity derivative
contracts” amounts reflected in the fair value table as of December 31, 2008 above.

The $15 million fair value of the discontinued Delaware City Refinery represents our estimated net
realizable value for the combined cycle power plant, which was the only part of the refinery that
was deemed to have any salvage value as of December 31, 2009. The $1.9 billion loss, which is
reflected in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, relates to the
impairment loss recognized related to all long-lived assets of the Delaware City Refinery, as
discussed further in Notes 2 and 3. See Note 3 for a discussion of the loss resulting from the
cancellation of various capital projects in progress.

Asset retirement obligations in the table above are calculated based on the present value of
estimated removal and other closure costs using our internal risk-free rate of return or
appropriate equivalent. The $95 million loss relates to asset retirement costs associated with the
shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery, which is included in the loss from discontinued operations
in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2009.

18. PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

We enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate
risk, and foreign currency risk, and to hedge price risk on other contractual derivatives into
which we have entered. In addition, we use derivative instruments for trading purposes based on
our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. All derivative instruments are
recorded on our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. When
we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge,
an economic hedge, or a trading activity. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated
and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The
effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a
cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then
recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if
any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedging relationships (hedges not
designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for derivative instruments entered into by us for
trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value
of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The cash flow effects of all of
our derivative contracts are reflected in operating activities in the consolidated statements of
cash flows for all periods presented.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, refined product, and grain
prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. To
reduce the impact of this price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use
commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options, to manage our exposure to
commodity price risks. For such risk management purposes, we use fair value hedges, cash flow
hedges, and economic hedges.

In addition to the use of derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, we also enter into
certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objectives for entering into
each of these types of derivative instruments and the level of activity of each as of December 31,
2009 are described below.

Fair Value Hedges

Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase
inventories. The level of activity for our fair value hedges is based on the level of our
operating inventories, and normally represents the amount by which our inventories differ from our
previous year-end LIFO inventory levels.

As of December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that
were entered into to hedge crude oil and refined product inventories. The information presents the
volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of
barrels).

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Cash Flow Hedges

Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined
product sales, and natural gas purchases. The purpose of our cash flow hedges is to lock in the
price of forecasted feedstock, product, or natural gas purchases or refined product sales at
existing market prices that are deemed favorable by management.

As of December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that
were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases or sales of crude oil and refined products. The
information presents the volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity

Economic Hedges

Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to (i)
manage price volatility in certain refinery feedstock, refined product, and grain inventories, and
(ii) manage price volatility in certain forecasted refinery feedstock, product, and grain
purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. In addition, through August 2009, we
used economic hedges to manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with
the Alon earn-out agreement, which was a separate contractual derivative that we entered into with
the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery but which was settled in August 2009, as further discussed
in Note 2. Our objective in entering into economic hedges is consistent with the objectives
discussed above for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. However, the economic hedges are not
designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, usually due to the
difficulty of establishing the required documentation at the date that the derivative instrument is
entered into that would allow us to achieve “hedge deferral accounting.” As of December 31, 2009,
we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into as
economic hedges. The information presents the volume of outstanding contracts by type of
instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels, except those identified as grain
contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels).

Trading Activities

These represent commodity derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes. Our
objective in entering into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes is to take
advantage of existing market conditions related to crude oil and refined products that management
perceives as opportunities to benefit our results of operations and cash flows, but for which there
are no related physical transactions. As of December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding
commodity derivative instruments that were entered into for trading purposes. The information

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. We
manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and
floating-rate debt. In addition, we have at times used interest rate swap agreements to manage our
fixed to floating interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate
debt. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges.
However, we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements during the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008, and 2007.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations.
To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and
purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting
purposes, and therefore they are classified as economic hedges. As of December 31, 2009, we had
commitments to purchase $456 million of U.S. dollars and commitments to sell $604 million of U.S.
dollars. These commitments matured on or before February 1, 2010, resulting in a $3 million
loss in the first quarter of 2010.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of
December 31, 2009 (in millions) and the line items in the balance sheet in which the fair values
are reflected. See Note 17 for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative
instruments. As indicated in Note 17, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar
derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements. The
table below, however, is presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the
reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts. In
addition, in Note 17 we netted cash received from brokers attributable to excess margin against the
fair value of the commodity derivatives; this cash receipt is not reflected in the table below.

Market and Counterparty Risk

Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into
the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in market
conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to
market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors.
Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk
management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact our overall
exposure to counterparty risk, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic or other conditions. In addition, financial services companies are the counterparties in
certain of our price risk management activities, and such financial services companies may be
adversely affected by periods of uncertainty and illiquidity in the credit and capital markets.

As of December 31, 2009, we had net receivables related to derivative instruments of $19 million
from counterparties in the refining industry and $157 million from counterparties in the financial
services industry. These amounts represent the aggregate receivables from companies in those
industries, reduced by payables from us to those companies under master netting arrangements that
allow for the setoff of amounts receivable from and payable to the same party. We do not require
any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do
not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit
rating.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash flow hedges primarily related to forward sales of
distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil, with $117 million of cumulative
after-tax gains on cash flow hedges remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income as of
December 31, 2009. We expect that all of the deferred gains at December 31, 2009 will be
reclassified into cost of sales over the next 12 months as a result of hedged transactions
that are forecasted to occur. The amount ultimately realized in income, however, will differ
as commodity prices change. For the year ended December 31, 2009, there were $132 million of
pre-tax losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a
result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting. This amount, which is the amount
classified as a loss from discontinued operations in the table, relates to the forecasted
sales of distillates that will not occur due to the shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery.

We have recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, due to uncertainties
related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of
certain state net operating losses, state income tax credits, and foreign tax credits, before they
expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be
recoverable. The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2009 is
primarily dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in certain states and
foreign source income in the United States.

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
the respective tax bases of our foreign subsidiaries based on the determination that such
differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of these subsidiaries are
expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2009, the
cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately $4.1 billion. If those
earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been
recorded after consideration of foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to estimate the amount
of additional tax that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed.

The following is a reconciliation of the change in unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the effect
of related penalties and interest and the federal tax effect of state unrecognized tax benefits (in
millions):

Included in the balance as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are $155 million and $136 million,
respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. We
do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.

We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to income taxes within
income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income. During the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008, and 2007, we recognized approximately $22 million, $22 million, and $1 million in
interest and penalties. We had accrued approximately $90 million and $68 million for the payment
of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Our tax years through 2001 and UDS’s tax years through 2001 are closed to adjustment by the
Internal Revenue Service. Valero’s separate tax years 2000 and 2001 (prior to the UDS Acquisition)
were settled in 2009. During 2008, Valero settled Premcor’s 2002-2003 separate tax year audit.
Our tax years 2002 through 2005 are currently under examination and Premcor’s separate tax years
2004 and 2005 are also under examination. During 2007, the Internal Revenue Service proposed
adjustments to our 2002 and 2003 taxable income, including adjustments related to inventory and
depreciation methods. We are



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

protesting the proposed adjustments and do not expect that the ultimate disposition of these
findings will result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations. We
believe that adequate provisions for income taxes have been reflected in the consolidated financial
statements.

20. SEGMENT INFORMATION

Prior to the second quarter of 2009, we had two reportable segments, which were refining and
retail. As a result of the VeraSun Acquisition during the second quarter of 2009 (as discussed in
Note 2), ethanol is now being presented as a third reportable segment. Our refining segment
includes refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and
transportation operations. The retail segment includes company-operated convenience stores,
Canadian dealers/jobbers and truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities, and home heating oil
operations. Our ethanol segment includes sales of internally-produced ethanol and distillers grains. Operations that
are not included in any of the three reportable segments are included in the corporate category.

The reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.
They are managed separately as each business requires unique technology and marketing strategies.
Performance is evaluated based on operating income. Intersegment sales are generally derived from
transactions made at prevailing market rates.

The following table reflects activity related to continuing operations (in millions):

21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

We have several qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the
Qualified Plans), some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Qualified
Plans cover substantially all employees in the United States and generally provide eligible
employees with retirement income based on years of service and compensation during specific
periods.

We also have several nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans (Supplemental Plans),
which provide additional pension benefits to executive officers and certain other employees. The
Supplemental Plans and the Qualified Plans are collectively referred to as the Pension Plans.

We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees, referred to
as other postretirement benefits. Substantially all of our employees may become eligible for these
benefits if, while still working for us, they either reach normal retirement age or take early
retirement. We offer health care benefits through a self-insured plan and, for certain locations,
a health maintenance organization while life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance
company. We fund our postretirement benefits other than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Individuals who became our employees as a result of an acquisition became eligible for other
postretirement benefits under our plan as determined by the terms of the relevant acquisition
agreement.

As of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, the accumulated benefit obligation for our Pension Plans was
$1.2 billion. With the exception of our main Qualified Plan as of December 31, 2009, the
accumulated benefit obligation for each of our Pension Plans was in excess of the fair value of
plan assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Due to an increase in the fair value of the assets
of our main Qualified Plan during 2009, the fair value of plan assets for our main Qualified Plan
was in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation by $163 million as of December 31, 2009, thus

(b)

These funds invest in the common stock of U.S. companies in the following approximate
proportions: 70% large-cap; 20% mid-cap, and 10% small-cap.

Equity securities in the Qualified Plans include our common stock in the amount of approximately
$20 million (2% of total Qualified Plan assets) as of December 31, 2008.

The investment policies and strategies for the assets of our Qualified Plans incorporate a
diversified approach that is expected to earn long-term returns from capital appreciation and a
growing stream of current income. This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and the
market value of the Qualified Plans’ assets may fluctuate from year to year. Risk tolerance is
determined based on our financial ability to withstand risk within the investment program and the
willingness to accept return volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk
parameters, the Qualified Plans’ mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity and
fixed-income investments. As of December 31, 2009, the target allocations for plan assets are 70%
equity securities and 30% fixed income investments. Equity securities include investments in U.S.
and foreign companies, including Valero Energy Corporation common stock. Fixed income securities
include bonds and notes issued by the U.S. government and its



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

agencies, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. The aggregate asset
allocation is reviewed on an annual basis.

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Qualified Plans is estimated
using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the
assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient. Three methods are used to derive
the long-term expected returns for each asset class. Because each method has distinct advantages
and disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average of the methods’ results is used.

We have less than $1 million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during 2010
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately
$50 million to our Qualified Plans during 2010, of which $30 million was contributed during
February 2010.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension plan and other postretirement benefit
plan obligations as of December 31, 2009 were based on the Hewitt Above Median yield curve (HAM).
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2008
were based on the Hewitt Bond Universe yield curve (HBU). The HAM and the HBU were designed by
Hewitt Associates LLC to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Both the HAM and the HBU are hypothetical
double and triple A (or better) yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual
discount rates with maturities from one-half year to more than 30 years. Each bond issue
underlying these yield curves is required to have a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s Investors
Service or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. The HBU includes all of
the bonds from this process. The HAM includes only those bonds with yields to maturity in the top
half of each respective maturity.

Due to significant volatility in the bond market as of December 31, 2008, we based our discount
rates on the HBU at the end of 2008. Because the market stabilized by the end of 2009, we based
our discount rates on the HAM as of December 31, 2009, which is more representative of rates being
used by other companies and more representative of the types of bonds that we would use to settle
these liabilities. Prior to 2008, we selected the discount rate based on a review of long-term
bonds that received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of
December 31 of each year. The average



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

timing of benefit payments from our plans was compared to the average timing of cash flows from the
long-term bonds to assess potential timing adjustments. Based on this analysis, there were no
significant differences in the timing of the cash flows, and therefore no adjustments were
necessary.

Defined Contribution Plans

Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan

We are the sponsor of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan, which is a defined contribution
plan. Participation in the Thrift Plan is voluntary. Participants may participate in the plan as
soon as practicable following enrollment.

Through December 31, 2009, Thrift Plan participants could make basic contributions up to 8% of
their total annual salary, which included overtime and cash bonuses. In addition, participants who
made a basic contribution of 8% could also make a supplemental contribution of up to 22% of their
total eligible annual salary. We matched 75% of each participant’s total basic contributions up to
8% based on the participant’s total annual salary, excluding cash bonuses. Commencing January 1,
2010, we will match 100% of basic contributions up to 6% of each participant’s total annual salary,
excluding cash bonuses.

Our contributions to the Thrift Plan for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were
$37 million, $38 million, and $38 million, respectively.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Valero Savings Plan

The Valero Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan covering our retail store employees, certain
other employees supporting the retail organization, and employees at our ethanol plants. Under the
Valero Savings Plan, participants can contribute from 1% to 30% of their compensation. We
contribute $0.60 for every $1.00 of the participant’s contribution up to 6% of compensation.

Our contributions to the Valero Savings Plan were $5 million for each of the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Premcor
Retirement Savings Plan

The Premcor Retirement Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan covering former Premcor
employees who became employees of Valero effective September 1, 2005. Under this plan,
participants can contribute from 1% to 50% of their eligible compensation. We contribute 200% of
the first 3% of a participant’s pre-tax contribution. In addition, we contribute 100% of a
participant’s pre-tax contribution above 3% up to 6% for certain union participants who contribute
to the plan.

Our contributions to the Premcor Retirement Savings Plan for the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008, and 2007 were $6 million, $6 million, and $7 million, respectively.

22. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We have various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans under which awards have been
granted, which are summarized as follows:

•

The 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the OSIP) authorizes the grant of various stock
and stock-based awards to our employees and our non-employee directors. Awards available
under the OSIP include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that
vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock that vests
over a period determined by our compensation committee. As of December 31, 2009, a total
of 12,002,043 shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under the OSIP.

•

A non-employee director stock option plan provided our non-employee directors with
grants of stock options to purchase our common stock. Effective January 1, 2007, each
director was granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock upon initial
election to our board of directors. These options expire seven years from the date of
grant. Effective April 23, 2007, no further options may be granted under this plan;
subsequent option grants are made under the OSIP.

•

Effective January 1, 2007, each non-employee director received an annual grant of our
common stock valued at $80,000 that vested in three equal annual installments. Effective
January 1, 2008, each non-employee director receives an annual grant of our common stock
valued at $160,000. Vesting will occur based on the number of grants received as follows:
(i) initial grants will vest in three equal annual installments, (ii) second grants will
vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining two-thirds on
the second anniversary of the grant date, and (iii) all grants thereafter will vest 100% on
the first anniversary of the grant date. As of December 31, 2009, a total of
139,247 shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

•

The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of various stock and
stock-related awards to employees and prospective employees. Awards include options to
purchase shares of



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance
goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by
our compensation committee. As of December 31, 2009, a total of 148,229 shares of our
common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

In addition, we formerly maintained other stock option and incentive plans under which previously
granted equity awards remain outstanding. No additional grants may be awarded under these plans.

Each of our current stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed below. The tax benefit
realized for tax deductions resulting from exercises and vestings under all of our stock-based
compensation arrangements totaled $9 million, $22 million, and $336 million for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Stock Options

Under the terms of our various stock option plans, the exercise price of options granted is not
less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options become
exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually
in three or five equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with
unexercised options generally expiring seven or ten years from the date of grant.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The expected life of options granted is the period of time from the grant
date to the date of expected exercise or other expected settlement. The expected life for each of
the years in the table below was calculated using the safe harbor provisions of SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and No. 110 related to share-based payments. Because the vesting
period for almost all of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008 was three years rather than five years as in prior years, historical exercise patterns did not
provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected life. Expected volatility is based on
closing prices of our common stock for periods corresponding to the expected life of options
granted. Expected dividend yield is based on annualized dividends at the date of grant. The
risk-free interest rate used is the implied yield currently available from the U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options at the grant
date. A summary of the weighted-average assumptions used in our fair value measurements is
presented in the table below:

intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007
was $12 million, $47 million, and $881 million, respectively. Cash received from stock option
exercises for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $11 million, $16 million, and
$130 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $45 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
outstanding unvested stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately two years.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock is granted to employees and non-employee directors. Restricted stock granted to
employees vests in accordance with individual written agreements between the participants and us,
usually in equal annual installments over a period of five years beginning one year after the date
of grant. Restricted stock granted to our non-employee directors vests from one to three years
following the date of grant. A summary of the status of our restricted stock awards is presented

As of December 31, 2009, there was $40 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately three years. The total fair value of restricted stock
that vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $12 million, $12 million,
and $44 million, respectively.

Performance Awards

In 2007, we issued to certain key employees performance awards, which represent rights to receive
shares of Valero common stock only upon Valero’s achievement of an objective performance measure.
Performance awards are subject to vesting in three annual amounts beginning approximately one year
after the date of grant. The number of common shares earned each year is based on the vested award
adjusted by a factor determined by our total shareholder return over a rolling three-year period
compared to the total shareholder return of a defined peer group for the same time period.

During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, no performance awards were granted or forfeited.
The fair value of performance awards subject to vesting for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
based on an expected conversion to common shares at a rate of 100% and a weighted-average fair
value of $23.43 per share, representing the market price of our common stock on the grant date
reduced by expected dividends over the vesting period. No performance awards vested during the
year ended December 31, 2009. The total fair value of performance awards that vested during the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $4 million and $11 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

As of December 31, 2009, 64,020 unvested restricted stock units were outstanding. Restricted stock
units vest in equal annual amounts over a three-year or five-year period beginning one year after
the date of grant. These restricted stock units are payable in cash based on the price of our
common stock on the date of vesting, and therefore they are accounted for as liability-based
awards. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, cash payments of $1 million,
$1 million, and $8 million, respectively, were made for vested restricted stock units. During the
year ended December 31, 2009, 5,340 restricted stock units were granted, 35,708 units vested, and
4,300 units were forfeited. Based on the price of our common stock on December 31, 2009, there was
$1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding unvested restricted stock
units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately four
years.

23. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

We have long-term operating lease commitments for land, office facilities, retail facilities and
related equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal
vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation,
production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products.

Certain leases for processing equipment and feedstock and refined product storage facilities
provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in excess
of a base amount. Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which
vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on
usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage.
Leases for convenience



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on sales volumes. In most
cases, we expect that in the normal course of business, our leases will be renewed or replaced by
other leases.

As of December 31, 2009, our future minimum rentals and minimum rentals to be received under
subleases for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year
were as reflected in the following table (in millions):

Other Commitments

We have various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements
(such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and
various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an
adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries.
Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on
market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. None of these obligations are
associated with suppliers’ financing arrangements. These purchase obligations are not reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets.

Environmental Matters

Currently, some of the proposed federal “cap-and-trade” legislation would require businesses that emit
greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an
auction process. In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated
with the



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United States. As a result of such a
program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions resulting
from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell. Although it is not possible at this
time to predict the final form of a cap-and-trade bill (or whether such a bill will be passed by
Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including a cap-and-trade
program – could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions
for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Tax Matters

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and
transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem
taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax
liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the
respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits
may subject us to interest and penalties.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from
the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which initially was
3% for on-island sales and services (but has subsequently been reduced to 1.5%) and 1% on export
sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. We disputed the GOA’s
assessment of the turnover tax in arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration
Institute (NAI) pursuant to which we sought to enforce our rights under a tax holiday agreement
related to the refinery and other agreements. The arbitration hearing was held on February 3-4,
2009. We also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba.

In April 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with the GOA and Caribbean Mercantile Bank NV
(CMB), pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on
exports into an escrow account with CMB, pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in
Aruba. Under this escrow agreement, we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the
disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the Aruba proceedings.
On April 20, 2009, we were notified that the Aruban tax court overruled our protests with respect
to the turnover tax assessed in January and February 2007, totaling $8 million. Under the escrow
agreement, we expensed and paid $8 million, plus $1 million of interest, to the GOA in the second
quarter of 2009. Amounts deposited under the escrow agreement, which totaled $115 million and
$102 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, are reflected as
restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the turnover tax described
above, the GOA has asserted other tax amounts including approximately
$35 million related to
various dividends. We also challenged approximately $35 million in foreign exchange payments made to the
Central Bank of Aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday, as well as other reasons. Both
the dividend tax and the foreign exchange payment matters were also addressed in the arbitration
proceedings discussed above.

On November 3, 2009, we received an interim First Partial Award from the NAI arbitral panel. The
panel’s ruling validated our tax holiday agreement, but the panel also ruled in favor of the GOA on
our dispute of the $35 million in foreign exchange payments previously made to the Central Bank of
Aruba. The panel’s decision did not, however, fully resolve the remaining two items in the
arbitration, the applicable dividend tax rate and the turnover tax. With respect to the dividend
tax, the panel ruled that



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the dividend tax was not a profit tax covered by the tax holiday agreement, but the panel did not
address the fact that Aruban companies with tax holidays are subject to a 0% dividend withholding
rate rather than the 5% rate alleged by the GOA. With respect to the turnover tax, the panel did
reject our contractual claims but it decided that our non-contractual claims against the turnover
tax merited further discussion with and review by the panel before a final decision could be
rendered. Prior to this interim decision, no expense or liability had been recognized in our
consolidated financial statements with respect to unfunded amounts. In light of the uncertain
timing of any final resolution of these claims as a result of the First Partial Award from the
panel, we recorded a loss contingency accrual of approximately $140 million, including interest,
with respect to both the dividend and turnover taxes.

Following
the November ruling, we entered into settlement discussions with the
GOA. On February 24,
2010, we signed a settlement agreement that details the parties’
proposed terms for settlement of these disputes and provides a framework for taxation of our
operations in Aruba on a go-forward basis as our tax holiday was set to expire on December 31,
2010. Under the proposed settlement, we will make a payment to the
GOA of $118 million in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to the
effective date of the settlement, including the turnover tax disputed in the Netherlands
Arbitration. The GOA will eliminate the turnover tax on exports as of the effective date of the
settlement. In addition, we will agree to exit the Tax Holiday regime following the effective date
of the settlement agreement and will enter into a new tax regime under which we will be subject to
a net profit tax of less than 10% on an overall basis. Beginning on the second anniversary of the
settlement agreement’s effective date, we will also begin to make an annual prepayment of taxes of
$10 million, with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years. The
proposed settlement will not be effective until the settlement agreement is approved by the Aruban Parliament and certain laws and regulations are modified
and/or established to provide for the terms of the settlement. The parties anticipate that this
will occur on or before June 1, 2010. If the settlement is not effective as of June 1, 2010, we
both have the right to terminate the settlement agreement and return to arbitration and
the on-island proceedings to continue litigation.

Contingent Earn-Out Agreements

In connection with our acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the seller was entitled to
receive payments in any of the seven years following the acquisition if certain average refining
margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level. In connection with the Premcor
Acquisition in 2005, we assumed Premcor’s obligation under a contingent earn-out agreement related
to Premcor’s acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva). Under
this agreement, Motiva was entitled to receive two separate annual earn-out payments depending on
(a) the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through May
2007, and (b) the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through
May 2006. As described below, final payments under all of these agreements have been made, and,
consequently, our obligations have been fulfilled under the agreements. No payments were made
during the year ended December 31, 2009.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The following table summarizes the aggregate payments we had made through December 31, 2008 and
payment limitations related to the following acquisitions (in millions). The amounts reflected for
the Delaware City Refinery represent amounts applicable only to the throughput/margin earn-out
contingency because the earn-out contingency related to the refinery’s gasification facility
expired during the second quarter of 2006 with no payment required. The amounts reflected
represent only amounts for which we were liable subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition.

As part of the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, a
liability was accrued for the aggregate limit of potential earn-out payments totaling $175 million.
The offsetting amount was reflected in property, plant and equipment and is being depreciated over
the remaining lives of the assets to which the cost was allocated. In January 2008, we made a
final earn-out payment of $25 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery.

In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, a liability of $50 million was accrued as of
September 1, 2005 as we believed it was probable that the maximum payments would be made related to
the Delaware City Refinery margin contingency. The offsetting amount was recorded in goodwill. A
final payment under this agreement was made in June 2007.

As discussed in Note 2, in July 2008 we received contingent consideration from Alon in the form of
a three-year earn-out agreement based on certain product margins, as partial consideration for the
sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery. On August 27, 2009, we settled this earn-out agreement with
Alon for $35 million, of which $18 million was received on the settlement date and the remaining
amount will be received in eight payments of $2.2 million each quarter beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2009.

Keystone Pipeline

In July 2008, we entered into an agreement to participate as a prospective shipper on the 500,000
barrel-per-day expansion of the Keystone crude oil pipeline system, which is expected to be
completed in 2012 or 2013. Once completed, the pipeline will enable crude oil to be transported
from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast at Port Arthur, Texas. We have also secured commitments from several Canadian oil producers to
sell to us heavy sour crude oil for shipment through the pipeline.

Insurance Recoveries

During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its
propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we submitted claims
to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. We reached a settlement with the insurance
carriers on

our claims, resulting in pre-tax income of approximately $100 million in the first
quarter of 2008 that was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.

24. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Remediation Liabilities

Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using currently
available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental
policies.

The balance of and changes in the accruals for environmental matters (excluding asset retirement
obligations), which are principally included in other long-term liabilities described in Note 13,
were as follows (in millions):

In connection with our various acquisitions, we assumed certain environmental liabilities
including, but not limited to, certain remediation obligations, site restoration costs, and certain
liabilities relating to soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, we have indemnified NuStar
Energy L.P. for certain environmental liabilities related to assets we previously sold to NuStar
Energy L.P. that were known on the date the assets were sold or are discovered within a specified
number of years after the assets were sold and result from events occurring or conditions existing
prior to the date of sale.

We believe that we have adequately provided for our environmental exposures with the accruals
referred to above. These liabilities have not been reduced by potential future recoveries from
third parties. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
factors such as the timing and extent of remediation, the determination of our obligation in
proportion to other parties,
improvements in remediation technologies, and the extent to which environmental laws and
regulations may change in the future.

25. LITIGATION MATTERS

MTBE Litigation

As of February 26, 2010, we were named as a defendant in 34 active cases alleging liability
related to MTBE contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water providers,
governmental authorities, and private water companies alleging that refiners and marketers of MTBE
and gasoline containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. We
have been named in these lawsuits together with many other refining industry companies. We are
being sued primarily as a refiner and marketer of MTBE and gasoline containing MTBE. We do not own
or operate gasoline station facilities in most of the geographic locations in which damage is
alleged to have occurred. The lawsuits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and
punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. Many of the cases are pending in federal
court and are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York (Multi-District Litigation Docket No. 1358,

In re: Methyl-Tertiary Butyl Ether
Products Liability Litigation

). Sixteen cases are pending in state court. Discovery is open in
all cases. We believe that we have strong defenses to all claims and are vigorously defending the
lawsuits.

We have recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to our MTBE litigation portfolio.
However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we believe that it is reasonably possible
that we may suffer a loss with respect to one or more of the lawsuits in excess of the amount
accrued. We believe that such an outcome in any one of these lawsuits would not have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. An estimate of the possible
loss or range of loss from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these cases cannot
reasonably be made.

Retail Fuel Temperature Litigation

As of February 26, 2010, we were named in 21 consumer class action lawsuits relating to fuel
temperature. We have been named in these lawsuits together with several other defendants in the
retail and wholesale petroleum marketing business. The complaints, filed in federal courts in
several states, allege that because fuel volume increases with fuel temperature, the defendants
have violated state consumer protection laws by failing to adjust the volume or price of fuel when
the fuel temperature exceeded 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The complaints seek to certify classes of
retail consumers who purchased fuel in various locations. The complaints seek an order compelling
the installation of temperature correction devices as well as monetary relief. The federal
lawsuits are consolidated into a multi-district litigation case in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Kansas (Multi-District Litigation Docket No. 1840,

In re: Motor Fuel Temperature Sales
Practices Litigation

). Discovery has commenced. The court has indicated that it will rule on the
Kansas-based class certification motion only (possibly in the spring of 2010), and then make a
decision on how to further proceed with the rest of the docket. We believe that we have several
strong defenses to these lawsuits and intend to contest them. We have not recorded a loss
contingency liability with respect to this matter, but due to the inherent uncertainty of
litigation, we believe that it is reasonably possible that we may suffer a loss with respect to one
or more of the lawsuits. An estimate of the possible loss or range of loss from an adverse result
in all or substantially all of these cases cannot reasonably be made.

Rosolowski

Rosolowski v. Clark Refining & Marketing, Inc., et al

., Judicial Circuit Court, Cook County,
Illinois (Case No. 95-L 014703). We assumed this lawsuit in our acquisition of Premcor Inc. The
lawsuit relates in part to a 1994 release to the atmosphere of spent catalyst from the now-closed
Blue Island, Illinois refinery. The case was certified as a class action in 2000 with three
classes, two of which received nominal or no damages, and one of which received a sizeable jury
verdict. That class consisted of local residents who claimed property damage or loss of use and
enjoyment of their property over a period of several years. In 2005, the jury returned a verdict
for the plaintiffs of $80 million in compensatory damages and $40 million in punitive damages.
However, following our motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (citing,
among other things, misconduct by plaintiffs’ counsel and improper class certification), the trial
judge in 2006 vacated the jury’s award and decertified the class. Plaintiffs appealed, and in June
2008 the state appeals court reversed the trial judge’s decision to decertify the class and set
aside the judgment. Thereafter, the Illinois Supreme Court refused to hear the case and returned
it to the trial court. We have submitted renewed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict
or, alternatively, a new trial. We are pursuing several options for resolution of this matter,
including settlement. While we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will
have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations, we have recorded a loss
contingency liability with respect to this matter.

Other Litigation

We are also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. We believe that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related to known
contingent liabilities related to these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on
our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
