CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF
SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

This Form 10-K contains certain estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions
and  other  forward-looking  statements  (as  defined  in  Section  27A  of  the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934)
that  involve  various  risks and  uncertainties.  While  these  forward-looking
statements,  and any  assumptions  upon which  they are based,  are made in good
faith and reflect  Valero's  current  judgment  regarding  the  direction of its
business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any
estimates,  predictions,  projections,  assumptions, or other future performance
suggested in this report.  These  forward-looking  statements  generally  can be
identified by the words  "anticipate,"  "believe,"  "expect,"  "plan," "intend,"
"estimate,"  "project,"  "budget,"  "forecast," "will," "could," "should," "may"
and similar expressions.

Some  important  factors (but not  necessarily  all  factors)  that could affect
Valero's sales,  growth,  profitability and operating results, or that otherwise
could cause actual results to differ  materially from those forecasted by Valero
are discussed in (a) Part I of this report under the headings  "Competition" and
"Environmental  Matters," (b) Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Commission.  Valero  does not  intend  to update  these  statements  unless  the
securities  laws  require  Valero to do so, and  Valero  does not  undertake  to
release publicly the result of any revisions to any  forward-looking  statements
that may be made to reflect events or circumstances  after the date of this Form
10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Place,  San Antonio,  Texas,  78212, and its telephone number is (210) 370-2000.
When used in this  report,  the term  "Valero"  may  refer,  depending  upon the
context,  to  Valero  Energy  Corporation,  to one or more  of its  consolidated
subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole.

Valero's annual reports on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q,  current
reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished  pursuant
to the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on Valero's
internet  website at  http://www.valero.com  as soon as  reasonably  practicable
after Valero  electronically  files such material  with, or furnishes it to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Valero is one of the top three  U.S.  refining  companies  in terms of  refining
capacity,  and is the largest independent  refining and marketing company in the
United  States.  Valero owns and operates 12 refineries in the United States and
Canada with a combined  throughput capacity of approximately 1.9 million barrels
per day (BPD) and total crude oil  capacity of  approximately  1.5 million  BPD.
Valero's refining network extends from eastern Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast and
West Coast.  Valero  produces  premium,  environmentally  clean products such as
reformulated

- -------------------
(1) Valero was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero Refining
and Marketing Company.  On August 1, 1997, Valero's name was changed from Valero
Refining and Marketing Company to Valero Energy Corporation.



gasoline  (RFG),  gasoline  meeting the  specifications  of the  California  Air
Resources  Board  (CARB),   CARB  diesel  fuel,   low-sulfur   diesel  fuel  and
oxygenates.(2)   Valero  also  produces  a  substantial  slate  of  conventional
gasolines, distillates, jet fuel, asphalt and petrochemicals.

Valero is also a leading  marketer of refined  products.  Valero markets branded
and  unbranded  refined  products on a wholesale  basis in the United States and
Canada through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network. Valero also markets
refined  products  and  convenience  store  merchandise  through  a  network  of
approximately 4,100 retail outlets in the United States and Canada under various
brand names including Diamond Shamrock(R),  Shamrock(R), Ultramar(R), Valero(R),
Beacon(R),  Total(R) and Exxon(R). Valero's business tends to be seasonal to the
extent of increased demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and, in
the northeast  regions,  increased demand for home heating oil during the winter
months.

Through  agreements  with  Valero  L.P.,  Valero  also has access to a logistics
system that complements  Valero's refining and marketing assets in the U.S. Gulf
Coast and Mid-Continent regions. Valero owns approximately 49 percent (including
the general partner interest) of Valero L.P., a master limited  partnership that
owns and operates  crude oil  pipelines,  crude oil and  intermediate  feedstock
storage  facilities,  and refined product  pipelines and terminals  primarily in
Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado. Units of Valero L.P. are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VLI."

                               RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Valero L.P.  Common Units and Debt Offering.  Effective  March 18, 2003,  Valero
L.P.  issued  5,750,000  common  units to the public for  aggregate  proceeds of
approximately  $211 million and completed a private placement of $250 million of
debt.  The net proceeds from those  offerings,  combined with  borrowings  under
Valero  L.P.'s credit  facility,  were used to fund a redemption of common units
from Valero and the  acquisition of certain  storage tanks and a pipeline system
from Valero discussed below.

Redemption of Common Units and Amendment to Partnership Agreement. Following the
equity and debt offerings  discussed above,  Valero L.P. redeemed  approximately
3.8  million  of its  common  units from  subsidiaries  of  Valero,  effectively
reducing  Valero's  ownership of Valero L.P.  from  approximately  73 percent to
approximately  49  percent.  At the same time,  Valero  L.P.  also  amended  its
partnership  agreement  to state that the general  partner of Valero L.P. may be
removed  by the vote of the  holders  of at least 58  percent  of Valero  L.P.'s
common and  subordinated  units,  excluding  the units held by affiliates of its
general  partner.  As a result  of the  partnership  agreement  changes  and the
issuance  and  redemption  of  Valero  L.P.  common  units,  Valero  will  cease
consolidation of Valero L.P.

Contribution of Storage Tanks and Pipeline System. Following the equity and debt
offerings and the common unit redemption  discussed above, Valero contributed to
Valero L.P. 58 crude oil and  intermediate  feedstock  storage  tanks located at
Valero's Corpus  Christi,  Texas City and Benicia  refineries for  approximately
$200  million in cash.  The storage  tanks have a capacity of  approximately  11
million  barrels.  Valero also  contributed  to Valero  L.P. a refined  products
pipeline  system for  approximately  $150  million in cash.  The  three-pipeline
system connects  Valero's Corpus Christi and Three Rivers  refineries to markets
in Houston,  San Antonio and the Texas Rio Grande Valley. In connection with the
contribution of these assets, Valero entered into certain throughput,  handling,
terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P.

(2) "Oxygenates" are liquid hydrocarbon  compounds  containing oxygen.  Gasoline
that  contains  oxygenates  ususally has lower carbon  monoxide  emissions  than
conventional gasoline. MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl either) is an oxygenate-rich,
high-octane  gasoline  blendstock produced by reacting methanol and isobutylene,
and is used to manufacture oxygenated and reformulated gasolines.



Acquisition of Ultramar Diamond  Shamrock  Corporation.  Effective  December 31,
2001, Valero completed the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation (UDS)
into Valero Energy Corporation, with Valero being the surviving corporation. The
transaction is referred to in this report as the UDS Acquisition. In the merger,
each  outstanding  share of UDS common stock,  other than treasury shares (which
were  cancelled)  and shares in employee  benefit  plans  (which were  converted
directly into Valero common stock), was converted into the right to receive,  at
the  shareholder's  election but subject to proration,  either (i) cash,  (ii) a
number of shares of Valero  common  stock,  or (iii) a  combination  of cash and
Valero common stock,  in each case having a value equal to the sum of $27.50 and
..614 shares of Valero common stock (valued at the average  closing Valero common
stock  price  over a ten  trading-day  period  ending  three  days  prior to the
merger).  Merger  consideration  paid by  Valero  to UDS  shareholders  included
approximately  $2.1  billion in cash and 45.9  million  shares of Valero  common
stock  (based on an  average  Valero  common  stock  price of $35.78  during the
measurement period).

UDS was an independent  refiner and retailer of refined products and convenience
store merchandise in the central,  southwest and northeast regions of the United
States and eastern Canada.  UDS owned and operated seven  refineries,  including
two in Texas,  two in California  and one each in Oklahoma,  Colorado and Quebec
with a combined throughput  capacity of approximately  850,000 BPD. UDS marketed
refined products and a broad range of convenience  store  merchandise  through a
wide  network of  convenience  stores in the United  States and eastern  Canada.
UDS's Northeast operations also included a retail home heating oil business.

As a condition to approval of the UDS Acquisition,  the Federal Trade Commission
required  Valero to sell UDS's 168,000 BPD Golden Eagle Refinery  located in the
San  Francisco  Bay Area,  its  related  wholesale  marketing  business,  and 70
associated  Beacon- and  Ultramar-branded  retail sites in Northern  California.
Valero  sold  these  assets on May 17, 2002 to Tesoro  Refining  and  Marketing
Company  for  $1.075  billion.  See Note 6 of Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

                                    SEGMENTS

Valero's primary reportable business segments are refining and retail.  Valero's
refining segment includes  refining  operations,  wholesale  marketing,  product
supply and distribution, and transportation operations. The refining segment is
segregated  geographically  into the Gulf Coast,  Mid-Continent,  West Coast and
Northeast regions. Valero's retail segment includes company-operated convenience
stores,  Canadian  dealers/jobbers,  truckstop  facilities,  cardlocks  and home
heating oil operations.  The retail segment is also  segregated  geographically.
Valero's retail operations in the northeastern  United States and eastern Canada
are  referred  to  as  the  Northeast  System,  and  Valero's  remaining  retail
operations in the United States are referred to as the U.S. System.  See Note 20
of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements for financial  information about
Valero's segments.

     (a)  Throughput  capacity  includes  crude  oil,  intermediates  and  other
          feedstocks. Total crude oil capacity is approximately 1,500,000 BPD.

Valero's  refineries produce gasolines,  distillates,  asphalt and other refined
products.  Gasolines  and  blendstocks  represent  about 55 percent of  Valero's
refined  product slate.  Distillates - such as home heating oil, diesel fuel and
jet fuel - represent about 30 percent, while asphalt, lubricants, petrochemicals
and other heavy products comprise the remaining 15 percent. Of the gasoline that
Valero  produces,  about 40 percent is reformulated  gasoline and CARB gasoline,
which sell at a premium over conventional  grades of gasoline.  About 75 percent
of Valero's  distillate  slate is low-sulfur  diesel,  CARB diesel and jet fuel,
which sell at a premium over high-sulfur heating oil.

Corpus Christi Refinery. The Corpus Christi Refinery is located along the Corpus
Christi  Ship  Channel on the Texas Gulf Coast.  The refinery is composed of two
plants,  Valero's  flagship West Plant and the recently acquired East Plant. The
West Plant is a highly complex refinery that specializes in processing primarily
lower-cost  sour crude oil and residual  fuel oil (resid) into premium  products
such  as  RFG  and  CARB  gasoline.  Valero  has  substantially  integrated  the
operations  of the West Plant and the East Plant,  allowing  for the transfer of
various feedstocks and blending components between the plants and the sharing of
resources.  The refinery  typically  receives and  delivers its  feedstocks  and
products by tanker and barge via deep-water  docking facilities along the Corpus
Christi Ship Channel. In addition,  the refinery has an eight-bay truck rack for
servicing local markets and ultimately uses the Colonial,  Explorer,  Valley and
other major pipelines - including  Valero L.P.'s pipelines - for distribution of
its products.

Texas City Refinery.  The Texas City Refinery is located  approximately 40 miles
southeast  of Houston on the Texas City Ship  Channel.  The Texas City  Refinery
processes primarily  lower-cost sour crude oils into a wide slate of products. A
45,000 BPD coking  unit and  related  facilities  are being  constructed  at the
refinery and are expected to be operational in late 2003. The refinery typically
receives  and  delivers  its  feedstocks  and  products  by tanker and barge via
deep-water  docking  facilities  along the Texas City Ship  Channel and also has
access to the Colonial,  Explorer and TEPPCO  pipelines for  distribution of its
products.

Houston  Refinery.  The Houston Refinery is located on the Houston Ship Channel.
The refinery  typically receives its feedstocks via tanker at deep-water docking
facilities along the Houston Ship Channel.  The refinery  primarily delivers its
products through major product pipelines,  including the Colonial,  Explorer and
TEPPCO pipelines.

Three  Rivers  Refinery.  The Three  Rivers  Refinery  is located in South Texas
between Corpus Christi and San Antonio.  The Three Rivers Refinery has access to
crude oil from  foreign  sources  delivered  to the Texas  Gulf  Coast at Corpus
Christi  as  well  as  crude  oil  from  domestic  sources  through  third-party
pipelines. A 70-mile pipeline that can deliver 120,000 BPD of crude oil connects
the Three Rivers Refinery to Corpus Christi. Valero distributes refined products
produced at this refinery primarily through pipelines owned by Valero L.P.


Krotz  Springs  Refinery.  The Krotz Springs  Refinery is located  between Baton
Rouge and Lafayette, Louisiana on the Atchafalaya River. The refinery's location
provides  access to upriver markets on the  Mississippi  River,  and its docking
facilities  along the  Atchafalaya  River are  sufficiently  deep to allow barge
access.  The facility also uses the Colonial  pipeline to transport  products to
markets in the Southeast and Northeast.

   WEST COAST

Valero's  West Coast  refining  region  includes  the Benicia  Refinery  and the
Wilmington  Refinery.  The following table presents the percentages of principal
feedstock  charges  and  product  yields  (on a  combined  basis)  for  the  two
refineries in this region for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Benicia Refinery.  The Benicia Refinery is located northeast of San Francisco on
the Carquinez Straits of San Francisco Bay. It is a highly complex refinery that
processes sour crude oils into a high percentage of premium products,  primarily
CARB gasoline. The refinery can receive crude oil supplies via a deep-water dock
that can  berth  large  crude oil  carriers  and a  20-inch  crude oil  pipeline
connected  to a  southern  California  crude oil  delivery  system.  Most of the
refinery's   products  are   distributed  via  the  Kinder  Morgan  pipeline  in
California.

Wilmington  Refinery.  The  Wilmington  Refinery  is located  near Los  Angeles,
California.  The refinery  processes a blend of lower-cost heavy and high-sulfur
crude oils. The refinery can produce all of its gasoline as CARB  gasoline.  The
refinery is  connected  by  pipeline to marine  terminals  and  associated  dock
facilities  that can move and  store  crude oil and  other  feedstocks.  Refined
products are  distributed  via a third-party  pipeline and terminals in southern
California, Nevada and Arizona.


     MID-CONTINENT

Valero's  Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee Refinery, the Ardmore
Refinery and the Denver Refinery. The following table presents the percentages
of principal  feedstock charges and product yields (on a combined basis) for the
three refineries in this region for the year ended December 31, 2002.

McKee Refinery. The McKee Refinery is located in the Texas Panhandle.  The McKee
Refinery  has access to crude oil from  Texas,  Oklahoma,  Kansas  and  Colorado
through Valero L.P.'s pipelines and third-party pipelines. The refinery also has
access at Wichita Falls, Texas to third-party pipelines that transport crude oil
from the  Texas  Gulf  Coast and West  Texas to the  Mid-Continent  region.  The
refinery  distributes  its products  primarily  via Valero  L.P.'s  pipelines to
markets in North Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma.

Ardmore  Refinery.  The  Ardmore  Refinery  is  located  in  Ardmore,  Oklahoma,
approximately  90 miles  from  Oklahoma  City.  Crude  oil is  delivered  to the
refinery  through  Valero  L.P.'s crude oil  gathering  and  trunkline  systems,
third-party pipelines and trucking operations.  Refined products are transported
via pipelines, rail cars and trucks.

Denver Refinery. The Denver Refinery is located outside Denver,  Colorado. Crude
oil for the refinery is supplied by a  third-party  pipeline  and by truck.  The
refinery  benefits  from a  refined  product  pipeline  that runs from the McKee
Refinery, which enhances flexibility of operations at both refineries.



   NORTHEAST

Valero's  Northeast refining region includes the Jean Gaulin Refinery in Quebec,
Canada and the Paulsboro  Refinery in New Jersey.  The following  table presents
the percentages of principal feedstock charges and product yields (on a combined
basis) for the two  refineries  in this region for the year ended  December  31,
2002.

Jean Gaulin Refinery.  Valero's Jean Gaulin Refinery is located in Levis, Canada
(near Quebec City).  The refinery  receives  crude oil by ship at its deep-water
dock  on  the  St.  Lawrence  River.  Valero  charters  large  ice-strengthened,
double-hulled  crude  oil  tankers  that can  navigate  the St.  Lawrence  River
year-round. The refinery's production is transported primarily by unit trains to
markets in Quebec  and New  Brunswick,  and by tankers  and trucks to markets in
Canada's Atlantic Provinces.

Paulsboro Refinery.  The Paulsboro Refinery is located in Paulsboro,  New Jersey
approximately 15 miles south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River. The refinery
processes  primarily  sour crude oils into a wide  slate of  products  including
gasoline,  distillates, a variety of lube oil basestocks,  asphalt and fuel oil.
Feedstocks  and refined  products are typically  transported by tanker and barge
via  refinery-owned  dock  facilities  along the  Delaware  River,  Exxon  Mobil
Corporation's product distribution system, an onsite truck rack and the Colonial
pipeline, which allows products to be sold into the New York Harbor market.

     WHOLESALE MARKETING

Valero  is a  leading  wholesale  marketer  of  unbranded  and  branded  refined
products. Valero markets on a wholesale basis in about 40 U.S. states and Canada
primarily  through an extensive bulk and rack marketing  network.  Approximately
90% of Valero's gasoline and distillate  production is distributed  through bulk
(60%) and rack (30%) channels.  Approximately 75% of Valero's  wholesale volumes
are sold through unbranded channels; the remainder is sold through approximately
1,800 branded  sites in the United  States under  several brand names  including
Diamond Shamrock(R),  Shamrock(R),  Ultramar(R),  Valero(R), Beacon(R), Total(R)
and Exxon(R).  Valero  expects to  consolidate  the number of brands used in its
various markets.  For the wholesale branded sites, Valero intends to move to the
Valero(R)  and  Beacon(R)  brands  in  California,  and  to  the  Valero(R)  and
Shamrock(R)  brands in the Northeast  United States.  In the  Mid-Continent  and
Southwest  regions,  Valero will use the  Diamond  Shamrock(R)  and  Shamrock(R)
brands.  Valero's  Canadian  wholesale  operations  will  continue  to  use  the
Ultramar(R) brand.


Valero's  bulk gasoline and  distillate  sales are made to various oil companies
and gasoline  distributors and are transported by pipeline,  barges and tankers.
The principal  purchasers of Valero's  transportation  fuels from terminal truck
racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers and end users (such as railroads,
airlines  and  utilities)   throughout  the  United  States.  Most  of  Valero's
refineries  have  access  to  deep-water  transportation   facilities,  and  all
interconnect  with  common-carrier  pipeline  systems,  allowing  Valero to sell
products  in most major  geographic  regions of the  United  States and  eastern
Canada.

Valero also enters into refined product exchange and purchase agreements.  These
agreements  enable Valero to minimize  transportation  costs,  optimize refinery
utilization,   balance  refined   product   availability,   broaden   geographic
distribution  and sell to markets  not  connected  to Valero's  refined  product
pipeline  system.  Exchange  agreements  provide  for the  delivery  of  refined
products to unaffiliated  companies at Valero's and third parties'  terminals in
exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to Valero by these
unaffiliated  companies  at specified  locations.  Purchase  agreements  involve
Valero's purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring
at specified locations. Most of these agreements are long-standing arrangements.
However, they generally can be terminated with 30 to 90 days notice. Valero does
not anticipate an  interruption  in its ability to exchange or purchase  refined
products in the near future.

Valero  also  sells a  variety  of other  products  produced  at its  refineries
including asphalt, lube base oils and commodity  petrochemicals.  These products
are transported via pipelines,  barges, trucks and railcars. Valero produces and
markets  approximately  60,000  BPD of asphalt  to  customers  in the paving and
roofing  industries.  Valero is the second  largest  producer  of asphalt in the
United States.  Valero  produces  asphalt at nine refineries and markets asphalt
from coast to coast in 20 states through 13 terminal facilities.

Lube base oils are  produced at Valero's  Paulsboro  Refinery  and are sold to a
variety  of  customers,   including  ExxonMobil  under  a  long-term  agreement.
ExxonMobil  purchases  about 50% of the refinery's  lube oil production with the
balance sold to independent motor oil and industrial lubricant customers.

Valero  produces  and markets a variety of  commodity  petrochemicals  including
aromatic solvents (benzene,  toluene, and xylene),  refinery- and chemical-grade
propylene and  anhydrous  ammonia.  Aromatic  solvents and propylene are sold to
customers in the chemical industry for further  processing into such products as
paints, plastics and adhesives. Ammonia, produced at Valero's McKee Refinery, is
sold to customers in the agriculture industry to be used as fertilizer.

No  customer  accounted  for more than 10 percent of  Valero's  total  operating
revenues in 2002.

     FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY

Valero  processes  a  wide  slate  of  feedstocks  including  sour  crude  oils,
intermediates and resid,  which can typically be purchased at a discount to West
Texas  Intermediate,  a benchmark crude oil. Sour crude oils and resid represent
approximately 60 percent of Valero's present  feedstock slate,  sweet crude oils
represent  approximately 30 percent, and the remaining 10 percent is composed of
blendstocks and other feedstocks.

About  two-thirds  of Valero's  crude oil feedstock  requirements  are purchased
through term contracts.  The remainder of Valero's  feedstock  requirements  are
generally purchased on the spot market.  Valero's term supply agreements include
arrangements to purchase  feedstocks directly or indirectly from various foreign
national  oil  companies  (including  feedstocks  originating  in Saudi  Arabia,
Mexico,  Iraq,  Kuwait,  Venezuela  and  Africa)  and  domestic  integrated  oil
companies at market-related prices. Valero uses the futures market to manage the
price risk inherent in purchasing  crude oil in advance of its delivery date and
in maintaining Valero's inventories.


Valero's U.S.  network of crude oil pipelines  and  terminals  (including  those
facilities  owned by  Valero  L.P.)  allows  Valero  to  acquire  crude oil from
producing  leases,  domestic  crude oil  trading  centers  and ships  delivering
cargoes of foreign and domestic  crude oil.  The network  also allows  Valero to
transport  crude oil supplies to many of its U.S.  refineries  at a  competitive
cost (compared to facilities that lack proprietary  supply  networks).  Valero's
Jean Gaulin  Refinery  relies on foreign  crude oil that is delivered to its St.
Lawrence River dock facility by ship.

Valero's cost to acquire  feedstocks,  and the price for which Valero ultimately
can sell  refined  products,  depend  on a number  of  factors  beyond  Valero's
control,  including  regional  and  global  supply of and  demand for crude oil,
gasoline,  diesel and other feedstocks and refined  products.  These in turn are
dependent upon, among other things, the availability of imports,  the production
levels of domestic and foreign suppliers,  competitive fuels, U.S. relationships
with  foreign  governments,  political  affairs  and the extent of  governmental
regulation.

VALERO L.P.

Through  agreements  with Valero L.P.,  Valero has access to a logistics  system
that complements its refining and marketing  business in the U.S. Gulf Coast and
Mid-Continent  regions.  Valero L.P. is a master limited  partnership  that owns
almost 800 miles of crude oil pipelines,  8 crude oil and intermediate feedstock
storage  facilities,  approximately 3,300 miles of refined product pipelines and
18 refined product  terminals.  Valero assumed its ownership  interest in Valero
L.P. (formerly known as "Shamrock  Logistics,  L.P.") upon completion of the UDS
Acquisition.  At December 31, 2002,  Valero  owned  approximately  73 percent of
Valero L.P. As discussed above under the caption "Recent Developments," on March
18,  2003,  Valero  reduced its  ownership  of Valero L.P. to  approximately  49
percent.  Valero's present ownership includes 100 percent of the general partner
interest in Valero L.P.  Valero L.P. is generally  referred to in this report as
the Partnership.


The  Partnership's  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2002,  were $118.5
million.  The  Partnership  generates  revenues from its pipeline  operations by
charging  tariffs for  transporting  crude oil and refined  products through its
pipelines.  The  Partnership  also  generates  revenues  from  its  terminalling
operations by charging a terminalling  fee to its customers.  Terminalling  fees
are earned when refined  products enter the  Partnership's  terminals;  the fees
include the cost of  transferring  the  refined  products  from the  terminal to
trucks.  An additional  fee is charged at the  terminals for blending  additives
into  various  refined  products.  The  Partnership's  primary  customer for its
pipeline  and   terminalling   operations  is  Valero.   Valero   accounted  for
approximately 99% of the Partnership's revenues in 2002.

The  Partnership's  refined  product  pipelines  transport  the  majority of all
refined  products  from  Valero's  McKee,  Three Rivers and Ardmore  refineries,
directly or indirectly,  to markets in Texas,  Oklahoma,  Colorado,  New Mexico,
Arizona and other Mid-Continent states. In addition, the Partnership's crude oil
pipelines deliver to these three refineries crude oil and other feedstocks, such
as gas oil and normal butane, from various points in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and
Colorado, and provide access to Texas, Gulf Coast and foreign crude oil sources.
The Partnership's  crude oil and intermediate  feedstock storage facilities have
an aggregate capacity of almost 14.5 million barrels. They are located in Texas,
Oklahoma and California and serve Valero's  Corpus Christi,  Texas City,  McKee,
Three Rivers, Ardmore and Benicia refineries.  The Partnership's refined product
terminals are located in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and California, and have an
aggregate capacity of almost 4 million barrels.


Retail

Valero is one of the largest  independent  retailers of refined  products in the
central and  southwest  United  States,  with strong brand  identification  in a
12-state retail area, including Texas, California, Colorado and Oklahoma, and in
eastern Canada. Approximately 10% of Valero's gasoline and distillate production
is  distributed   through  retail  channels.   Valero's  retail  operations  are
segregated  geographically  into two groups:  the U.S.  System and the Northeast
System.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,  total sales of refined  products  through
the U.S.  System's retail sites averaged  approximately  142,000 BPD. Valero has
about 1,265  company-operated  sites in its U.S. System;  of these sites,  about
one-half are owned and one-half are leased. Company-operated stores are operated
under a variety of brand names including Corner Store(R),  Ultramart(R) and Stop
N Go(R).  Stores in Valero's  U.S.  System sell  gasoline  and diesel fuel under
several  brand  names  including  Diamond  Shamrock(R),   Valero(R),  Beacon(R),
Ultramar(R)  and Total(R).  In California,  Valero intends to convert its retail
facilities from the Beacon(R) and Ultramar(R)  brands to the Valero(R) brand. In
the  Mid-Continent  and  Southwest  regions,   Valero  intends  to  convert  its
Total(R)-branded sites to the Diamond Shamrock(R) brand.

The company-operated convenience stores sell, in addition to gasoline and diesel
fuels, a wide variety of immediately  consumable products such as snacks, candy,
beer, fast foods,  cigarettes and fountain drinks. Valero has an ongoing program
to modernize and upgrade the convenience  stores it operates.  These efforts are
focused primarily on improving the uniformity and appearance of existing stores.
Improvements generally include new exterior signage,  lighting and canopies, and
pump and interior store  upgrades.  Under a plan adopted by Valero in connection
with the UDS  Acquisition,  Valero  conducted  a  detailed  review of its retail
network to identify  appropriate  markets for further investment and to identify
under-performing  stores where future investment was deemed to be non-strategic.
Stores identified in the  under-performing  group were to be closed or divested,
while the remaining stores were further  evaluated on a store-by-store  basis to
determine  the level of  investment  upgrade  each would  receive.  Through this
process, 76 stores were re-imaged and upgraded in 2002, approximately 160 stores
were closed or divested during the year and  approximately 150 additional stores
were identified for closure or divestiture.

Valero's Northeast System includes retail operations in the northeastern  United
States and eastern  Canada.  In eastern  Canada,  Valero is a major  supplier of
refined  products  serving  Quebec,   Ontario  and  the  Atlantic  Provinces  of
Newfoundland,  Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. For the year
ended  December 31, 2002,  total  retail sales of refined  products  through the
Northeast System averaged approximately 77,000 BPD. Gasoline and diesel fuel are
sold  under the  Ultramar(R)  brand  through a network  of  approximately  1,100
outlets  throughout  eastern  Canada.  Valero  plans  to  continue  to  use  the
Ultramar(R) brand in its Canadian markets. As of December 31, 2002, Valero owned
(or  controlled  under  long-term  leases)  nearly 500  stores  and  distributed
gasoline to approximately 600 dealers and independent jobbers. In addition,  the
Northeast  System  operates  85  cardlocks,  which are  card- or  key-activated,
self-service,   unattended   stations  that  allow   commercial,   trucking  and
governmental fleets to buy gasoline and diesel fuel 24 hours a day.

The Northeast System operations also include one of the largest home heating oil
businesses  in North  America.  In 2002,  Valero sold home heating oil under the
Ultramar(R) brand to approximately  250,000 households in eastern Canada and the
northeastern United States.

Valero's competitive retail position is supported by its proprietary credit card
program, which had about 900,000 active accounts as of December 31, 2002. Valero
uses electronic  point-of-sale (POS) credit card processing at substantially all
of its company- and dealer-operated stores. POS processing reduces transaction
time at the sales counter and lowers Valero's credit card program costs.


                                   COMPETITION

The refining and marketing industry continues to be highly competitive. Valero's
competitors  include fully integrated major oil companies (e.g.,  ExxonMobil and
ConocoPhillips)  and other  independent  refining and marketing  entities (e.g.,
Sunoco and  Premcor)  that  operate in all of  Valero's  market  areas.  Many of
Valero's  competitors are engaged on a national or  international  basis in many
segments  of  the  petroleum  business,   including   exploration,   production,
transportation,  refining and  marketing,  on scales much larger than  Valero's.
Such  competitors  may have greater  flexibility  in  responding to or absorbing
market changes occurring in one or more of such segments.  All of Valero's crude
oil and feedstock  supplies are purchased from third-party  sources,  while some
competitors  have  proprietary  sources  of crude  oil  available  for their own
refineries.

Financial  returns in the  refining and  marketing  industry  depend  largely on
refining margins and retail fuel margins, both of which fluctuate significantly.
Refining  margins are  frequently  impacted by sharp  changes in crude oil costs
which are not  immediately  - or  necessarily  -  reflected  in refined  product
prices.  Historically,  refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely
to  continue  to  be  volatile  in  the  future.  Valero's  ability  to  process
significant amounts of sour crude oils enhances Valero's competitive position in
the  industry as sour crude oils  typically  can be  purchased  at a discount to
sweet crude oils.

Valero's retail business faces fierce  competition  from fully  integrated major
oil companies that have  increased  their efforts to capture retail market share
in recent  years.  Valero  also  competes  with large  grocery  stores and other
merchandisers   (the  so-called   "hypermarts")  that  often  sell  gasoline  at
aggressively competitive prices in order to attract customers to their sites. In
Quebec,  Canada and in the adjacent  Atlantic  Provinces,  Valero is the largest
independent retailer of gasoline.

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The  principal  environmental  risks  associated  with Valero's  operations  are
emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water or groundwater.
Valero's  operations  are  subject  to  environmental  regulation  by  the  U.S.
Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA) and numerous  federal,  state and local
authorities  under extensive  federal,  state and local  environmental  laws and
regulations,  including  those  relating to the discharge of materials  into the
environment,  waste management,  pollution  prevention and  characteristics  and
compositions  of fuels.  The  significant  federal laws  applicable  to Valero's
operations  include the Clean Air Act,  the Clean Water Act,  the  Comprehensive
Environmental  Response,  Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and the Solid
Waste  Disposal  Act, as amended by the Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act
(RCRA). A discussion of significant environmental regulations affecting Valero's
operations follows.

EPA's "Tier II"  Gasoline  and Diesel  Standards.  The EPA's "Tier II"  gasoline
standard,  adopted  under the Clean Air Act,  requires  the  sulfur  content  in
gasoline  to be  reduced  in phases  from  approximately  300 parts per  million
(beginning in 2004) to 30 parts per million by 2006. In addition, the EPA's Tier
II diesel  standard  requires the sulfur  content of diesel fuel sold to highway
consumers  to be  reduced  from 500 parts per  million  to 15 parts per  million
beginning in 2006. Modifications will be required at most of Valero's refineries
as a result of the Tier II gasoline and diesel  standards.  Valero believes that
capital  expenditures of about $1 billion will be required  between now and 2006
for Valero to meet the new Tier II specifications.  This includes  approximately
$300 million for related  projects at two Valero  refineries to improve refinery
yield and octane  balance  and to  provide  hydrogen  as part of the  process of
removing  sulfur during the  production of gasoline and diesel.  Valero  expects
that such estimates will change as additional engineering analyses are completed
and progress is made toward construction of these various projects. Factors that
will affect the impact of these  regulations on Valero include Valero's ultimate
selection  of  specific   technologies   to  meet  the  Tier  II  standards  and
uncertainties related to timing,  permitting and construction of specific units.
Valero  expects  to meet all Tier II  gasoline  and  diesel  standards  by their
respective effective dates, both in the U.S. and Canada.



EPA's Section 114 Initiative.  In 2000, the EPA issued to a majority of refiners
operating  in the United  States a series of  information  requests  pursuant to
Section 114 of the Clean Air Act as part of an  enforcement  initiative.  Valero
received a Section 114 information  request  pertaining to all of its refineries
owned at that time.  Valero has completed  its response to the request.  Several
other refiners have reached  settlements with the EPA regarding this enforcement
initiative. Though Valero has not been named in any proceeding, it also has been
discussing the possibility of settlement with the EPA regarding this initiative.
Based  in  part  upon  announced  settlements  and  evaluation  of its  relative
position,  Valero expects to incur penalties and related  expenses in connection
with a potential settlement of this enforcement initiative. Valero believes that
any potential settlement penalties will be immaterial to its financial position.
However,  Valero  believes  that any potential  settlement  with the EPA in this
matter  will  require  various  capital  improvements  or changes  in  operating
parameters, or both, at some or all of its refineries which could be material in
the aggregate.

Houston/Galveston SIP. Valero's Houston and Texas City Refineries are located in
the  Houston/Galveston  area which is classified as "severe  nonattainment"  for
compliance  with EPA  air-quality  standards for ozone. In October 2001, the EPA
approved a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to bring the  Houston/Galveston  area
into compliance with the EPA's ozone  standards by 2007. The  EPA-approved  plan
was based on a requirement for industry  sources to reduce emissions of nitrogen
oxides (NOx) by 90 percent.  Certain industry and business groups challenged the
plan based on  technical  feasibility  of the 90  percent  NOx  control  and its
effectiveness  in  meeting  the ozone  standard.  In  December  2002,  the Texas
Commission on  Environmental  Quality (TCEQ) adopted a revised  approach for the
Houston/Galveston  SIP. This alternative requires an 80 percent reduction in NOx
emissions  and a 64 percent  reduction in  so-called  highly  reactive  volatile
organic compounds (HRVOC).  This alternative plan is subject to EPA scrutiny and
approval. Valero's Texas City and Houston Refineries will be required to install
NOx and HRVOC control and monitoring  equipment and practices by 2007, at a cost
estimated by Valero to be  approximately  $60 million based on the proposed TCEQ
approach.

MTBE Restrictions. The presence of MTBE in some water supplies in California and
other states,  resulting from gasoline  leaks  primarily  from  underground  and
aboveground  storage tanks, has led to public concern that MTBE poses a possible
health  risk.  As a result  of  heightened  public  concern,  California  passed
initiatives to ban the use of MTBE as a gasoline  component in California by the
end of 2003. The California Air Resources Board's  specifications for CARB Phase
III gasoline will become  effective at the beginning of 2004.  Valero  estimates
that the cost to permit and modify its California refineries to comply with CARB
Phase III gasoline  specifications and eliminate MTBE as a gasoline component is
approximately  $60 million.  In  addition,  other states and the EPA have either
passed or proposed or are  considering  proposals  to restrict or ban the use of
MTBE.  If MTBE were to be  restricted or banned  throughout  the United  States,
Valero believes that its major non-California MTBE-producing facilities could be
modified to produce other octane enhancing  products for a capital investment of
approximately $35 million.

Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental  Regulations.
In  2002,  Valero's  capital   expenditures   attributable  to  compliance  with
environmental  regulations were  approximately  $130 million,  and are currently
estimated  to be  approximately  $500  million for 2003 and  approximately  $570
million  for 2004.  These  estimates  for 2003 and 2004 do not  include  amounts
related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures relating
to compliance with environmental regulations is not determinable.

Governmental  regulations are complex, are subject to different  interpretations
and are becoming  increasingly  more stringent.  Therefore,  future  legislative
action and regulatory  initiatives could result in changes to operating permits,
additional  remedial  actions or increased  capital  expenditures  and operating



costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition,  because
certain air  emissions  at Valero's  refineries  have been  grandfathered  under
particular environmental laws, any major upgrades at any of its refineries could
require   potentially   material   additional   expenditures   to  comply   with
environmental laws and regulations.

                                    EMPLOYEES

As of February 28, 2003,  Valero had 19,947  employees,  including  salaried and
hourly  employees,  of which 16,451 were employed in the United States and 3,496
were employed in Canada.

                                   PROPERTIES

Valero's  principal  properties are described above under the caption  "Valero's
Operations."  In addition,  Valero owns  feedstock and refined  product  storage
facilities  in  various  locations.  Valero  believes  that its  properties  and
facilities are generally adequate for its operations and that its facilities are
maintained  in a good  state of repair.  Valero is the lessee  under a number of
cancelable  and  non-cancelable  leases for certain  properties,  including  the
Benicia  Refinery  dock  facility,   office   facilities,   retail   facilities,
transportation equipment and various assets used to store, transport and produce
refinery   feedstocks  and/or  refined  products.   See  Note  22  of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valero's patents relating to its refining  operations are not material to Valero
as a whole. The trademarks and tradenames under which Valero conducts its retail
and branded wholesale business - specifically Diamond Shamrock(R),  Shamrock(R),
Ultramar(R), Valero(R), Beacon(R), Total(R), Corner Store(R), Ultramart(R), Stop
N Go(R) and  ValPar(TM)  - and other  trademarks  employed in the  marketing  of
petroleum  products are  important to Valero's  wholesale  and retail  marketing
operations.

Valero currently has approximately 150  company-operated  convenience stores and
supplies  approximately  450  distributor-owned  sites  under  a  brand  license
agreement with  TotalFinaElf  for use of the Total(R) brand.  The  Total-branded
sites are located primarily in Arkansas,  Iowa, Kansas,  Missouri,  Nebraska and
Oklahoma. Under Valero's license agreement with TotalFinaElf, Valero's rights to
use the Total(R)  brand will expire in various  states from year to year through
2007. Valero believes that it can successfully convert, when necessary, from the
Total(R) brand to the Diamond Shamrock(R) or Shamrock(R) brand without adversely
impacting Valero's operations.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Unocal

Union Oil Company of  California  v. Valero  Energy  Corporation,  United States
District  Court,  Central  District of California  (filed January 22, 2002).  In
2002,  Union Oil Company of  California  (Unocal)  sued Valero  alleging  patent
infringement.  The  complaint  seeks  a 5.75  cent  per  gallon  royalty  on all
reformulated  gasoline  infringing  on  Unocal's  '393 and '126  patents.  These
patents cover certain  compositions of cleaner-burning  gasoline.  The complaint
seeks  treble  damages for Valero's  alleged  willful  infringement  of Unocal's
patents and Valero's  alleged  conduct to induce others to infringe the patents.
In a previous lawsuit  involving its '393 patent,  Unocal prevailed against five
other  major  refiners.  In  2001,  the FTC  began  an  antitrust  investigation
concerning Unocal's conduct with a joint industry research group during the time
that Unocal was prosecuting its patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark  Office
(PTO).  On March 4,  2003,  the FTC  announced  that it was  filing a  complaint
against Unocal for antitrust violations. The FTC's complaint seeks an injunction
against any future patent enforcement  activity by Unocal.  Each of the '393 and
'126  patents is being  reexamined  by the PTO.  The PTO has  issued  notices of
rejection of all claims of each of these patents.  These  rejections are subject
to additional proceedings,  including  administrative appeal by Unocal, followed
by an  appeal  in  federal  district  court or the  court of  appeals.  Ultimate
invalidation  would  preclude  Unocal from pursuing  claims based on the '393 or
'126 patents. Unocal's patent lawsuit against Valero is indefinitely stayed as a
result  of the  PTO  reexamination  proceedings.  Notwithstanding  the  judgment
against the other refiners in the previous  litigation,  Valero believes that it
has several strong  defenses to Unocal's  lawsuit,  including those arising from
Unocal's  misconduct,  and  Valero  believes  it will  prevail  in the  lawsuit.
However,  due  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  litigation,  there  can be no
assurance that Valero will prevail,  and an adverse result could have a material
adverse effect on Valero's results of operations and financial position.

     MTBE Litigation

Valero  is  a  defendant  in  various  cases  alleging  MTBE   contamination  in
groundwater in New York and  California.  The plaintiffs  generally  allege that
refiners  and   manufacturers  of  gasoline   containing  MTBE  are  liable  for
manufacturing a defective product.  In California,  the lawsuits have been filed
by local water providers, including the City of Santa Monica, the City of Dinuba
and Fruitridge Vista Water Company. In New York, a lawsuit has been filed by the
Suffolk  County Water  Authority.  These cases are primarily  based on a product
liability/product defect theory and seek individual,  unquantified  compensatory
and punitive  damages and attorneys'  fees.  Valero believes it is unlikely that
the final outcome of any one of these suits filed by local water providers would
have a  material  adverse  effect on its  results  of  operations  or  financial
position,  but that an adverse  result in a majority of these cases could have a
material  adverse  effect  on  Valero's  results  of  operations  and  financial
position.

     Environmental Proceedings

United States Environmental Protection Agency Region II, In the Matter of: Mobil
Oil Corporation,  Notice of Violation CAA-02-2001-1305 (May 15, 2001) (Paulsboro
Refinery).  The EPA issued  notices of  violation  (NOVs)  relating to Mobil Oil
Corporation's operation of the Paulsboro Refinery prior to Valero's ownership of
the refinery.  Valero purchased the refinery from Mobil in 1998. The NOVs allege
that Mobil performed certain actions on the refinery's fluid catalytic  cracking
unit (FCCU) without  satisfying  certain permitting and other requirements under
the New Source Review (NSR)  provisions of the Clean Air Act. Mobil tendered the
NOVs to Valero for indemnification under the refinery purchase agreement between
Mobil and Valero. In 2002, an arbitration panel determined that Valero must bear
responsibility  for the  NOVs.  EPA has  not  asserted  a  specific  demand  for
administrative  or civil  penalties  or  equitable  relief  under the NOVs,  but



potential  penalties  under the NOVs  could  exceed  $100,000.  Valero is in the
process of  assuming  the  defense of these NOVs.  Valero  believes  that it has
various legal and equitable defenses in support of its position that no material
liability should be borne by Valero with respect to these NOVs.

United States Environmental Protection Agency Region V v. Total Petroleum,  Inc.
(Alma  Refinery).   This  enforcement   action  began  in  September  1997.  The
allegations pertain to a refinery at Alma,  Michigan,  owned by Total Petroleum,
Inc. (TPI) and include  alleged Clean Air Act  violations  relating to emissions
monitoring,  reporting and inspection.  Other allegations  included alleged RCRA
violations  relating to  maintenance of wastewater  ponds,  storage of hazardous
waste, and disposal of wastes. UDS acquired TPI in 1997, and in 1999, UDS closed
the Alma Refinery.  In April 2000, TPI settled the EPA enforcement action, which
required  the funding of $9.9  million of specific  environmental  and  economic
development  projects  and the payment of $4.0 million in  penalties.  A Consent
Decree  reflecting the settlement was entered by the district court on March 27,
2001.  These  settlement  amounts were fully  accrued as of March 31,  2001.  In
January 2003, Valero finalized the terms of a RCRA  corrective-action  agreement
with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as required by the Consent
Decree.  No  additional  accruals  were  recorded by Valero in  connection  with
finalization of the corrective-action agreement.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Benicia Refinery).  Valero received 14
violation  notices  (VNs),  from April 11, 2002 through July 25, 2002,  from the
BAAQMD pertaining to Valero's Benicia Refinery. Six of the VNs relate to alleged
excess  emissions in connection  with certain power  failures at the refinery in
the second quarter of 2002. The remaining VNs allege excess  emissions  from, or
equipment failures at, various units at the refinery. No enforcement orders have
been issued. Initial penalties of $277,000 have been proposed by the BAAQMD with
respect to this set of VNs.  Valero received an additional 17 VNs between August
15, 2002 and February 20, 2003. These VNs also primarily allege excess emissions
from, or equipment  failure at, various  refinery  units. No penalties have been
assessed with respect to this second set of VNs. Valero is negotiating  with the
BAAQMD to resolve all of these matters.

Colorado  Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) (Denver Refinery).
An  initial  consent  order was  issued  jointly by the CDPHE and EPA in 1989 to
Colorado Refining Company (CRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero, and Conoco
to address  groundwater  contamination  under the two parties' adjacent refining
facilities  in  Colorado.  In 1992,  Conoco and CRC  received a joint  Notice of
Additional  Work  requiring  the companies to install  interim  measures to meet
state groundwater  standards at Sand Creek (down gradient from both refineries).
In 1998, Conoco and CRC received  duplicate orders from CDPHE and EPA to install
new  boundary  controls  at Sand  Creek,  to  evaluate  the need for  additional
boundary  controls  and to recover free product  under the  refineries.  CRC has
conducted  monitoring  and other  operations  to comply  with these  orders.  In
January  2003,  CRC  received  a  remedial   order  from  CDPHE   requiring  the
installation  of  interim  control  measures  to  contain  groundwater  at CRC's
property  boundary and to prevent  migration  of  hydrocarbons  offsite.  Valero
estimates the capital cost of the interim boundary  control system  (extraction,
treatment and  reinjection) to be  approximately  $4.4 million  (engineering and
construction  from 2003 to 2005),  with  additional  operational and maintenance
costs of  approximately  $2.5 million from 2004 to 2012. A final control measure
ultimately  will be  required  after the CDPHE  completes a study of the interim
measure's  effectiveness.  Valero expects the final measure to be  substantially
the same as the  interim  measure,  but the final  plan will be  subject  to the
results of CDPHE's study and assessment of any continued  contamination.  Valero
does not expect the CDPHE to issue any final  order for  closure of this  matter
until after 2012.

Communities for a Better Environment, a California non-profit organization,  and
Nicole McAdam,  on behalf of the general public v. Tosco  Corporation,  Ultramar
Inc., et al.,  Superior  Court of the State of California  for the County of San
Francisco,  Case No. 300595 (filed January 19, 1999).  Communities  for a Better
Environment  (CBE) is a non-profit  organization that brought this lawsuit under
California's  Safe Drinking Water and Toxic  Enforcement Act of 1986, also known
as California  Proposition 65. Any individual  acting in the public interest may



enforce  Proposition 65 by filing a lawsuit against a business  alleged to be in
violation  of this  law.  CBE  originally  filed  this  suit  against  13 energy
companies, including Ultramar Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero. CBE has
recently served additional defendants,  including two other Valero subsidiaries.
CBE alleges  violations of the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic  Enforcement Act of
1986 at several gasoline  stations in California,  including alleged releases of
benzene and toluene into groundwater. Approximately 30 Valero sites are named in
this proceeding.  (Valero was also included on the basis of its ownership of the
Golden Eagle  Refinery  following the UDS  Acquisition  and prior to the sale of
that refinery to Tesoro).  Plaintiffs  seek,  among other  things,  unquantified
property  damages,   remediation,   installation  of  monitoring  equipment  and
attorneys'  fees.  The judge in this matter  ordered a bifurcated  proceeding to
litigate  the  claims of CBE;  Valero  does not  expect to  litigate  the claims
pertaining  to the Valero sites until 2004.  Valero  believes  that it has valid
defenses with respect to several CBE claims but is unable to predict the outcome
of this litigation.

Michigan  Department of Environmental  Quality,  et al. v. Imlay City Gas & Oil,
Inc. and TPI Petroleum,  Inc., 30th State Judicial Circuit Court, Ingham County,
Michigan  (filed June 28, 2002).  This lawsuit is a civil action  brought by the
Attorney  General  of the  State of  Michigan  and the  Michigan  Department  of
Environmental  Quality  (MDEQ) to enforce an  Administrative  Order for Response
Activity issued by the MDEQ. The Administrative Order requires the defendants to
take  specific  actions  to abate  and  remedy  releases  of  alleged  hazardous
substances  from a commercial  petroleum  dispensing  station in Tuscola County,
Michigan.  The  defendants  are present  and prior  owners of the  station.  TPI
Petroleum,  Inc.  (TPI) is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of Valero.  TPI sold the
station in 1993 to Imlay  City Gas & Oil,  Inc.  (Imlay).  The  plaintiffs  seek
judicial  enforcement  of the  Administrative  Order  and  civil  fines of up to
$25,000 per day of noncompliance for alleged violations of the Order. Plaintiffs
also seek  reimbursement  for the state's response  activity costs and exemplary
damages equal to three times the amount of these costs. Valero believes that the
liability associated with this matter will be covered by Imlay's indemnity under
the agreement  between TPI and Imlay for the sale of the station.  In a separate
ruling,  Valero prevailed against Imlay and its owner for indemnification  under
the sales agreement.

New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP) (Paulsboro Refinery).
Valero received  several related and unrelated NJDEP  Administrative  Orders and
Notices of Civil Administrative  Penalty Assessments (Orders) from February 2002
to December 2002 for alleged  noncompliance  with certain NJDEP emission  limits
and NJDEP stack testing,  inspection,  nuisance and record-keeping requirements.
None of the Orders contains proposed penalties in excess of $100,000, but in the
aggregate,  the Orders'  potential  penalties could exceed $100,000.  Valero has
asserted certain defenses to the Orders. Valero is negotiating with the NJDEP to
resolve  these  issues  and  believes  that a  majority  of these  Orders can be
settled.

NJDEP (Paulsboro Refinery).  In 2002, Valero received four Administrative Orders
and Notices of Civil Administrative  Penalty Assessments in the aggregate amount
of $318,300 from the NJDEP.  The  penalties  are for alleged  failures to repair
certain  leak  detection  points in the  refinery  within the 15-day  regulatory
deadline for repairs,  and are based on multiple  inspections of the refinery by
NJDEP  during the fourth  quarter of 1999 and from the first  through  the third
quarter of 2002.  Valero has  asserted  certain  defenses  to the Orders and has
taken certain corrective actions with respect to these incidents.

     Other Litigation

Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary  course of  business.  Valero  believes it is  unlikely  that the final
outcome of any of the claims or  proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material  adverse  effect on its  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity;  however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the range of
any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable  degree of precision and
Valero cannot provide  assurance that the resolution of any particular  claim or
proceeding  would not have an  adverse  effect  on its  results  of  operations,
financial position or liquidity.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of 2002.


                                     PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Valero's  common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
"VLO."  In  connection   with  the  UDS   Acquisition   on  December  31,  2001,
approximately  45.9  million  shares of Valero  common  stock were issued to UDS
shareholders  in exchange  for shares of UDS common stock under the terms of the
merger agreement (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

As of February  28,  2003,  there were 7,174  holders of record and an estimated
52,000 additional beneficial owners of Valero's common stock.

The  following  table  shows  the high and low  sales  prices  of and  dividends
declared on Valero's common stock for each quarter of 2002 and 2001.

On January 23, 2003,  Valero's Board of Directors  declared a regular  quarterly
cash  dividend of $0.10 per common  share  payable  March 12, 2003 to holders of
record at the close of business on February 12, 2003.  Dividends are  considered
quarterly  by the Board of Directors  and may be paid only when  approved by the
Board.




ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The consolidated selected financial data for the five-year period ended December
31, 2002 was derived from Valero's audited  consolidated  financial  statements.
Certain  previously  reported  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the
2002  presentation.  The  following  table  should  be read  together  with  the
historical  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in
Item  8.  Financial   Statements  and  Supplementary   Data  and  with  Item  7.
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations.

The following summaries are in millions of dollars except for per share amounts:


(a)  Includes the operations of UDS beginning January 1, 2002.
(b)  Includes the  operations  of Huntway and the  operations  related to the El
     Paso Corpus Christi refinery and related refined product logistics business
     beginning June 1, 2001. Property, plant and equipment, net, goodwill, total
     assets,   long-term   debt  (less   current   portion)  and  capital  lease
     obligations,  company-obligated  preferred  securities of subsidiary trusts
     and stockholders' equity include amounts related to UDS, which was acquired
     by Valero on December 31, 2001.
(c)  Includes  the  operations  related to the Benicia  Refinery and the related
     distribution  assets  (Distribution  Assets) beginning May 16, 2000 and the
     operations  related to service stations included as part of the acquisition
     from ExxonMobil (Service Stations)  beginning June 16, 2000 (combined,  the
     Benicia Acquisition).
(d)  Includes   the   operations   of   the   Paulsboro    Refinery    beginning
     September 17, 1998.

     to market  value,  which  resulted  in a $111.1  million  reduction  in net
     income, or $1.98 per share.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

The  following  review of the results of operations  and financial  condition of
Valero  should be read in  conjunction  with Items 1. & 2. Business & Properties
and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this report.
In the discussions that follow, all per share amounts assume dilution.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Form 10-K,  including  without  limitation the  discussion  below under the
heading  "Results  of  Operations  -  Outlook,"   contains  certain   estimates,
predictions, projections, assumptions and other "forward-looking statements" (as
defined in Section  27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933 and  Section  21E of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and  uncertainties.
While these forward-looking  statements, and any assumptions upon which they are
based, are made in good faith and reflect  Valero's  current judgment  regarding
the direction of its business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes
materially, from any estimates, predictions,  projections,  assumptions or other
future performance  suggested in this report. These  forward-looking  statements
can  generally be  identified by the words  "anticipate,"  "believe,"  "expect,"
"plan," "intend," "estimate,"  "project," "budget," "forecast," "will," "could,"
"should,"  "may"  and  similar  expressions.  These  forward-looking  statements
include, among other things, statements regarding:

     o    the  effect  of  Valero's  acquisition  of UDS on  Valero's  business,
          results of operations and financial position;
     o    future refining margins, including gasoline and heating oil margins;
     o    future retail margins,  including  gasoline,  diesel, home heating oil
          and convenience store merchandise margins;
     o    expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil discounts
          and operating expenses;
     o    anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories;
     o    Valero's anticipated level of capital investments,  including deferred
          refinery  turnaround and catalyst costs and capital  expenditures  for
          environmental  and other  purposes,  and the  effect of those  capital
          investments on Valero's results of operations;
     o    anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other
          feedstocks  and  refined  products  in the United  States,  Canada and
          elsewhere;
     o    expectations regarding environmental and other regulatory initiatives;
          and
     o    the effect of general  economic and other  conditions  on refining and
          retail industry fundamentals.

Valero's  forward-looking  statements  are based on its beliefs and  assumptions
derived  from  information  available  at the  time  the  statements  are  made.
Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these
forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the
following:

     o    acts of  terrorism  aimed  at  either  Valero's  facilities  or  other
          facilities  that could  impair  Valero's  ability  to  produce  and/or
          transport refined products or receive foreign feedstocks;
     o    political  conditions  in crude oil producing  regions,  including the
          Middle East;
     o    the  domestic  and  foreign  supplies  of  refined  products  such  as
          gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil and petrochemicals;
     o    the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks;
     o    the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting
          Countries  (OPEC)  to agree on and to  maintain  crude  oil  price and
          production controls;
     o    the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations;
     o    refinery overcapacity or undercapacity;


     o    the  actions  taken by  competitors,  including  both  pricing and the
          expansion and  retirement  of refining  capacity in response to market
          conditions;
     o    environmental  and other  regulations  at both the  state and  federal
          levels and in foreign countries;
     o    the level of foreign imports of refined products;
     o    accidents   or  other   unscheduled   shutdowns   affecting   Valero's
          refineries,  machinery,  pipelines or equipment,  or those of Valero's
          suppliers or customers;
     o    changes in the cost or availability of  transportation  for feedstocks
          and refined products;
     o    the  price,  availability  and  acceptance  of  alternative  fuels and
          alternative-fuel vehicles;
     o    cancellation of or failure to implement  planned capital  projects and
          realize  the  various  assumptions  and  benefits  projected  for such
          projects  or  cost  overruns  in  constructing  such  planned  capital
          projects;
     o    earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes and irregular weather,  which can
          unforeseeably  affect the price or  availability of natural gas, crude
          oil and other feedstocks and refined products;
     o    rulings,  judgments or  settlements  in  litigation  or other legal or
          regulatory matters,  including  unexpected  environmental  remediation
          costs in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage;
     o    the  introduction or enactment of federal or state  legislation  which
          may adversely affect Valero's business or operations;
     o    changes in the credit ratings assigned to Valero's debt securities and
          trade credit;
     o    changes  in the  value of the  Canadian  dollar  relative  to the U.S.
          dollar; and
     o    overall economic conditions.

Any one of these factors,  or a combination of these factors,  could  materially
affect  Valero's  future results of operations  and whether any  forward-looking
statements ultimately prove to be accurate.  Valero's forward-looking statements
are not  guarantees  of  future  performance,  and  actual  results  and  future
performance may differ  materially  from those suggested in any  forward-looking
statements.  Valero  does not  intend to update  these  statements  unless it is
required by the securities laws to do so.

All  subsequent  written and oral  forward-looking  statements  attributable  to
Valero or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
by the foregoing. Valero undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result
of any  revisions  to any such  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect events or circumstances  after the date of this report or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events.

     Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials (dollars per barrel)



General

Valero's net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $91.5  million,  or
$0.83 per share,  compared to net income of $563.6 million,  or $8.83 per share,
for the year ended December 31, 2001.  For the fourth quarter of 2002,  Valero's
net income was $89.0 million, or $0.81 per share,  compared to $51.6 million, or
$0.82 per share,  for the fourth quarter of 2001.  Since the UDS Acquisition was
completed on December 31, 2001,  the  operations of UDS were not included in the
2001  results.  In  addition,  since the Huntway and El Paso  Acquisitions  were
completed on June 1, 2001, the  operations  related to those  acquisitions  were
included in 2001 results for only the last seven months of 2001.

Operating revenues increased 80% for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result
of the additional  throughput volumes from the refinery  operations  acquired in
the UDS, El Paso and Huntway  Acquisitions and the additional revenues generated
from the retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition,  partially offset by
a decline in refined product prices. However, operating income for 2002 declined
$530.5 million,  or 53%, from the $1.0 billion  reported in 2001 due mainly to a
$518.4  million  decrease in operating  income from the  refining  segment and a
$138.7  million  increase  in   administrative   expenses   (including   related
depreciation  and  amortization  expense),  partially  offset by an  increase of
$126.6 million in operating  income from the retail segment  attributable to the
retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition.

Operating income for 2002 benefited from synergies that were created as a result
of the merger  between  Valero and UDS. The combined  company  benefited in 2002
from  gross  margin   improvements   and  from   reductions   in  operating  and
administrative expenses. The improvement in gross margin resulted primarily from
a reduction in inventory levels, yield optimization and procurement initiatives.
Operating  and  administrative  expense  synergies  were  achieved  mainly  from
incorporating best practices between the two companies and eliminating  salaries
and benefits associated with former UDS executives and other employees.



Refining

Operating  income for Valero's  refining  segment declined from $1,160.8 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2001 to $642.4  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002.  The decrease in refining  segment  operating  income was due
principally to a 34% decline in the throughput margin per barrel attributable to
depressed sour crude oil discounts and lower refined  product  margins in all of
Valero's markets.

During  2002,  refining  operating  results  were  negatively  impacted  by  the
following factors:
     o    discounts on Valero's sour crude oil  feedstocks  during 2002 declined
          approximately  50% from 2001 levels  primarily due to OPEC's crude oil
          production cuts in 2002,  which limited the availability of sour crude
          oil on  the  world  market,  whereas  2001  benefited  from  increased
          supplies  of sour  crude  oil  while  demand  for  sweeter  crude  oil
          increased  to meet  lower  sulfur  requirements  for  certain  refined
          products;
     o    gasoline and distillate margins declined  significantly in all regions
          of the United  States from 2001 to 2002 due to high  inventory  levels
          for these  products as a result of an  increase  in gasoline  imports,
          increased  gasoline  production   (particularly  in  California),   an
          unusually  warm winter in the  northeastern  part of the United States
          and in Europe,  and lower jet fuel demand.  Although  gasoline  demand
          increased  during the year, high imports of gasoline kept  inventories
          at above-normal levels; and
     o    Valero's  refinery  utilization  rates  were  significantly  below its
          normal  operating  rates  during  2002 as  eight  of  Valero's  twelve
          refineries were affected by turnaround activities.  In addition to the
          scheduled  downtime,  Valero also  experienced  significant  unplanned
          maintenance at its  refineries  during 2002, and production at most of
          its  refineries  was reduced at various  times  during the year due to
          uneconomic operating conditions.
The above decreases in refining  operating  income were partially  offset by the
increased  throughput  volumes  resulting  from  the  UDS,  Huntway  and El Paso
Acquisitions,  an  approximate  net  $76  million  benefit  resulting  from  the
settlement in June and August 2002 of petroleum products purchase agreements and
related hedges, and a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of its
LIFO inventories.

Refining cash  operating  expenses and refining  depreciation  and  amortization
expense were 57% and 70% higher,  respectively,  for the year ended December 31,
2002 compared to the year ended  December 31, 2001 as a result of the additional
refinery  operations  from the UDS, El Paso and Huntway  Acquisitions.  However,
these operating costs on a per barrel basis remained stable from 2001 to 2002.

Retail

Retail  operating income was $128.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $1.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 2001.  The 2002 retail
operating income includes both the U.S. and Northeast retail operations acquired
in the UDS  Acquisition.  The 2001 retail  operations  included only 11 northern
California retail stores operated by Valero at that time.

During 2002, pursuant to a plan adopted in conjunction with the UDS Acquisition,
Valero  implemented  various  changes in its retail  operations  that  benefited
results in 2002 and are  expected  to further  benefit  future  results  for the
retail segment.  As part of these changes,  76 stores were reimaged and upgraded
in 2002. These changes also included the closure or divestiture of approximately
160 stores and the  identification  of an  additional  150 stores for closure or
divestiture.  Gains or losses on closed or divested stores will be recognized to
the extent of the  difference  between any net proceeds  received on disposition
and the net book value of each store.  Since the value  assigned to these stores
was  established  as part of the final  purchase  price  allocation  for the UDS
Acquisition, and due to the short period of time between the UDS Acquisition and
the  actual  or  planned  disposition,  any  gains or  losses  have been and are
expected to be insignificant.



Retail cash selling expenses and retail  depreciation  and amortization  expense
for the year ended December 31, 2002 were significantly  higher than 2001 due to
the additional retail stores acquired in the UDS Acquisition.

Corporate Expenses and Other

Administrative  expenses,   including  depreciation  and  amortization  expense,
increased  $138.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 2002 compared to the
year ended  December 31, 2001.  The  increase  was due  primarily to  additional
administrative  expenses  resulting  from the UDS  Acquisition  and increases in
employee  salaries and benefits and professional  services,  partially offset by
reduced  variable  compensation  expense  as a  result  of the  lower  level  of
operating  income  recognized  during  2002  and  the  nonrecurrence  in 2002 of
integration and early  retirement  costs incurred in 2001 in connection with the
UDS  Acquisition.  For the year ended  December  31, 2001,  cash  administrative
expenses  for  the  combined  operations  of UDS  and  Valero  would  have  been
approximately  $323 million compared to approximately  $282 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The reduction in cash  administrative  expenses was due
mainly to synergies resulting from the UDS Acquisition,  primarily  attributable
to  the  elimination  of  salaries  and  benefits  associated  with  former  UDS
executives and other employees.

Other income (expense), net increased $13.2 million from expense of $4.6 million
for the year ended  December  31,  2001 to income of $8.6  million  for the year
ended  December  31, 2002 due  primarily  to a $7.0  million  increase in equity
income from Valero's  investments in joint ventures and $5.9 million of interest
income related to the  amortization of the discount on the notes receivable from
Tesoro in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business.

Net  interest  and debt  expense  increased  $197.2  million  for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended  December 31, 2001 due primarily to
interest expense on borrowings  incurred to finance the UDS Acquisition  coupled
with interest expense  incurred on the debt assumed in the UDS  Acquisition,  as
well  as  the  full-year  effect  of  interest  expense  on  the  capital  lease
obligations associated with the June 1, 2001 El Paso Acquisition.

The minority interest in net income of consolidated partnership of $14.1 million
represents the minority unitholders' share of the net income of Valero L.P.

Distributions  on preferred  securities of subsidiary  trusts increased to $30.0
million for the year ended  December  31,  2002 from $13.4  million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 due to the distributions incurred on the $200 million of
8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities assumed in the UDS Acquisition.

Income tax expense decreased $273.1 million from 2001 to 2002 mainly as a result
of lower operating income and higher interest expense.  The effective income tax
rate was 39% for 2002 compared to 37% for 2001 due to the impact of the Canadian
operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition.


The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in millions):


Valero utilizes the financial measure of earnings before interest, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which is not defined under United States
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Management  presents EBITDA in its
filings  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 and its  press  releases.
Management uses this financial measure because it is a widely accepted financial
indicator used by some  investors and analysts to analyze and compare  companies
on the  basis of  operating  performance.  In  addition,  EBITDA  is used in the
computation of certain debt covenant  ratios  included in Valero's  various debt
agreements.  EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period,  nor
is it presented as an  alternative  to operating  income or income before income
taxes. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure
of  performance  prepared in accordance  with United States  generally  accepted
accounting  principles.  Valero's method of computation of EBITDA may or may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

         (millions of dollars, except per barrel and per gallon amounts)



                   Refining Operating Highlights by Region (e)



     Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials (dollars per barrel)


General

Valero's net income was $563.6 million,  or $8.83 per share,  for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to net income of $339.1 million,  or $5.60 per share,
for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Operating revenues increased $317.2 million, or 2%, to $15.0 billion during 2001
compared to 2000 due primarily to a 19% increase in average daily sales volumes,
offset to a large  extent  by a 14%  decrease  in the  average  sales  price per
barrel. The increase in average daily sales volumes was due primarily to (i) the
full-year  effect of volumes  attributable to the Benicia  Acquisition,  (ii) an
increase in the sale of feedstocks and products  purchased for resale, and (iii)
higher  throughput  volumes  resulting from the  contribution of the El Paso and
Huntway  refineries  acquired  in  the  second  quarter  of  2001  and  capacity
expansions at the Texas City and other  refineries  during 2001. The decrease in
average sales prices was due primarily to lower refined product prices resulting
from increased refined product inventories industry-wide and a decrease in crude
oil prices.  Operating income increased $390.4 million,  or 64%, to $1.0 billion
during 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to a $419.1 million, or 57%, increase
in  operating  income from the  refining  segment,  partially  offset by a $29.8
million increase in administrative  expenses (including related depreciation and
amortization expense).

Refining

Operating income for Valero's  refining segment increased to $1.2 billion during
the year ended  December 31, 2001 compared to $741.7  million for the year ended
December  31, 2000 due  primarily  to a 21%  increase in  throughput  margin per
barrel,  partially  offset by a $224.8  million  increase in refining  operating
expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense. During 2001, refining
operating results benefited from the following factors:

     o    the  full-year   contribution  from  the  Benicia   Acquisition  which
          increased operating income by approximately $66 million;


     o    increased  throughput  volumes  resulting from the Huntway and El Paso
          Acquisitions  completed  in June 2001 and capacity  expansions  of the
          crude oil units at the Texas City Refinery completed in February 2001;
     o    a significant  improvement in sour crude oil discounts  resulting from
          an increase in supplies of heavier  crude oil while demand for sweeter
          crude oil  increased  to meet lower  sulfur  requirements  for certain
          refined products;
     o    higher  lube  oil  margins   resulting  mainly  from  improved  market
          conditions;
     o    higher prices for No.6 fuel oil and other heavy  products  relative to
          crude oil prices; and
     o    recognition of an $8.8 million benefit attributable to the acquisition
          of UDS  inventories  on December  31, 2001 as  discussed  in Note 5 of
          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Partially  offsetting  the above  increases in  operating  income were (i) lower
distillate margins,  when compared to exceptionally high margins in 2000, due to
strong demand and extremely low industry inventory levels in 2000 resulting from
cold weather and high natural gas prices which caused power  producers to switch
to fuel oil to run their  plants,  (ii) a  significant  decrease  in margins for
propylene and other petrochemical feedstocks, to negative levels in 2001, due to
slowing economic activity throughout the world, and (iii) an increase in natural
gas, hydrogen and methanol feedstock costs relative to crude oil.

Refining  cash  operating  expenses were $162.8  million  higher during the year
ended  December  31,  2001  compared  to the year ended  December  31,  2000 due
primarily to the operations of the Corpus Christi  Refinery and related  refined
product  logistics  business  acquired  from El Paso in 2001  and  increases  in
employee salaries, benefits and variable compensation,  maintenance costs and ad
valorem  taxes,  partially  offset by reduced  refinery  energy costs.  Refining
depreciation  and amortization  expense  increased by $62.0 million from 2000 to
2001 due mainly to an increase  in  turnaround  and  catalyst  amortization  and
increased  depreciation  expense  resulting from the 2001  acquisition of the El
Paso facilities and capital expansion projects.

Corporate Expenses and Other

Administrative  expenses,   including  depreciation  and  amortization  expense,
increased  $29.8  million  as a result  of an  increase  in  employee  salaries,
benefits and variable  compensation,  and integration and early retirement costs
incurred in 2001 in connection with the UDS  Acquisition.  Partially  offsetting
these  increases in  administrative  expenses was the  nonrecurrence  in 2001 of
costs recorded in 2000 associated with certain litigation and other matters.

Other income  (expense),  net decreased $4.9 million from income of $0.3 million
during 2000 to expense of $4.6 million  during 2001 due to lower  equity  income
from Valero's 20% equity interest in the Javelina  off-gas  processing  plant in
Corpus Christi. The Javelina plant's results were impacted by higher natural gas
feedstock  costs and lower product prices  resulting  from a weak  petrochemical
market.  Partially  offsetting the reduced  results from the Javelina plant were
lower costs related to the agreement entered into by Valero in September 1999 to
sell a portion of its accounts receivable.

Net interest and debt expense increased $12.2 million from 2000 to 2001 due to a
full year of interest  expense  during 2001 on  borrowings  incurred to fund the
Benicia Acquisition, including interest on the senior notes issued in June 2000,
and interest expense recognized on the capital lease obligations associated with
the El Paso  Acquisition,  partially  offset by a  decrease  in bank  borrowings
resulting from Valero's earnings and cash flow during 2001.

Distributions  on preferred  securities of subsidiary  trust increased from $6.8
million in 2000 to $13.4 million in 2001 due to a full year of  distributions on
the PEPS  Units  issued in June 2000 in  connection  with  funding  the  Benicia
Acquisition.


Income tax expense  increased  from $189.1  million in 2000 to $331.3 million in
2001 due primarily to the significant  increase in pre-tax income. The effective
income tax rate was 37% for 2001  compared  to 36% for 2000 due to the impact of
higher state income taxes in 2001.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in millions):

OUTLOOK

During late January and early February of 2003,  domestic crude oil  inventories
declined to one of their lowest  levels since 1976.  This low level of crude oil
inventories,  combined with the impact that the national oil workers'  strike in
Venezuela had on crude oil and other feedstock supplies in the market,  resulted
in a  significant  narrowing of sour crude oil  discounts and resulted in higher
overall feedstock costs.  This, in turn, caused sweet crude oil and intermediate
feedstock  processing economics to be unfavorable and various refineries reduced
production.  Valero reduced its refinery operating rates by as much as 15% early
in the first quarter of 2003.  Since early February,  the crude oil fundamentals
have improved with higher OPEC production  levels and the partial  resumption of
Venezuelan  crude oil exports.  The increased  availability of sour crude oil on
world markets since early  February has also resulted in a significant  widening
in sour crude oil discounts.

In regard to refined  products,  the  industry  production  cuts  caused by poor
refining margins early in the first quarter of 2003,  combined with a very large
number of scheduled  turnarounds  throughout the refining industry,  resulted in
lower gasoline and distillate  production,  which contributed to a steep decline
in gasoline and distillate inventories. In addition, the extreme cold weather in
the  northeast  United States and eastern  Canada  further  impacted  distillate
inventories. In addition to the reduction of supply, the Venezuelan oil workers'
strike  resulted  in an  increased  demand for U.S.  refined  products  by Latin
American and Caribbean countries,  much of which is being supplied from the Gulf
Coast and the West Coast, including increased shipments from Valero.

Although  gasoline  margins in  California  remained  weak in early  2003,  CARB
gasoline margins  increased from  approximately $7 per barrel at the end of 2002
to over $20 per barrel by early March 2003. This strength in West Coast refining
margins is expected  to continue as the supply of CARB  gasoline is reduced as a
result of turnarounds,  the effect of lower RVP restrictions  effective March 1,
and a switch by several  West  Coast  refiners  to CARB  gasoline  blended  with
ethanol.

As the effects of low inventory levels,  the Venezuelan  strike,  continued cold
weather and turnaround activity have made their impact on the markets,  refining
economics have improved significantly.  In late February, Valero raised refinery
production  levels back to normal levels as a result of higher refining margins.
During  2003,   Valero  expects  refined   product   inventories  to  remain  at
below-average levels, which should support continued strong refining margins. In
addition, Valero anticipates that the current favorable supply and demand trends





should  support  continued  wide sour crude oil  discounts.  Unlike  much of the
refining  industry,  Valero has a light schedule of turnaround  activity  during
2003. Due to the anticipated  improvement in refining  fundamentals  and the low
number of scheduled  turnarounds,  as well as expected income contributions from
strategic projects completed during 2002 and additional  synergies expected from
the UDS  Acquisition,  Valero expects that 2003 net income will be significantly
higher than 2002.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2002
Net cash provided by operating  activities  for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $272.3  million  compared to $905.5  million for the year ended December 31,
2001, a decrease of $633.2  million.  The decrease in cash provided by operating
activities  was due primarily to the  unfavorable  change in income as described
above under "Results of Operations" and an $80.1 million  increase in the amount
of cash used to fund working capital and deferred  charges and credits.  Changes
in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2002 included:
     o    a significant  increase in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable
          resulting  from increased  commodity  prices from December 31, 2001 to
          December 31, 2002;
     o    an increase in  receivables  of  approximately  $200  million due to a
          reduction in the amount of receivables  sold under  Valero's  accounts
          receivable sales facility;
     o    the receipt of approximately  $141 million of income tax refunds,  net
          of payments; and
     o    a  decrease  in  accrued   expenses  as  a  result  of  payments   for
          change-in-control  benefits to former UDS  employees and a decrease in
          employee bonuses.

Valero's investing  activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 provided net
cash of $248.6 million.  Valero's investing  activities  included the receipt of
$300.9 million from the liquidation of its investment in the Diamond-Koch  joint
venture and $925.0 million from the sale of the Golden Eagle Business, partially
offset  by  payments  of  $803.4  million  for  capital  expenditures,  deferred
turnaround  and catalyst costs and earn-out  payments and net cash  requirements
related to the Golden Eagle Business of $183.5 million.

During 2002, operating and investing activities provided $520.9 million of cash,
which was used  primarily  to reduce  Valero's  debt by  $412.9  million  with a
resulting increase of $109.5 million in Valero's cash balance.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2001
Net cash provided by operating  activities  increased  $304.2  million to $905.5
million during 2001 compared to 2000 due mainly to the  significant  increase in
net income discussed above under "Results of Operations," partially offset by an
increase  in the  amount  of cash used to fund  working  capital.  During  2001,
approximately $1.1 billion of cash was generated from earnings,  of which $181.2
million  was used for other  operating  activities,  primarily  working  capital
requirements.  During  2001,  accounts  payable  decreased  $237.6  million  and
accounts  receivable  decreased  $122.1  million  primarily  due to a decline in
various  commodity prices from December 2000 to December 2001,  partially offset
by an increase in volumes purchased and sold. Accounts payable also declined due
to  Valero's  redelivery  to the U.S.  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  in 2001 of
approximately  one million barrels of crude oil in settlement of a time exchange
of crude oil entered into in 2000.

Valero's investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 used net cash
of $3.3 billion.  Valero's investing activities included the UDS, Huntway and El
Paso  Acquisitions  totaling  $2.7  billion and  payments of $591.0  million for
capital  expenditures,  deferred  turnaround  and  catalyst  costs and  earn-out
payments.


Capital Investments
During the year ended  December 31, 2002,  Valero  expended  $779.5  million for
capital  investments  of which $627.7  million  related to capital  expenditures
(including $130 million for  environmental  projects) and $151.8 million related
to deferred  turnaround and catalyst costs.  Capital  expenditures  for the year
ended December 31, 2002 included:
     o    $99.4 million for the expansion of the fluid  catalytic  cracking unit
          (FCCU)  and the  expansion  of the  alkylation  unit at the Texas City
          Refinery. Aggregate costs incurred for these projects through December
          31, 2002 totaled $162.0 million.
     o    $48.4 million to reconfigure  the Three Rivers Refinery in response to
          new low-sulfur regulations and to process a more sour crude oil slate.
          Aggregate  costs incurred for this project  through  December 31, 2002
          totaled $74.4 million.
     o    $25.0  million to  construct  a  cogeneration  facility at the Benicia
          Refinery to produce electric power and steam. Aggregate costs incurred
          for this project  totaled $64.9  million.  The  cogeneration  facility
          began operations in mid-October 2002.
     o    $69.4 million for retail projects including  remodeling and re-imaging
          numerous  convenience  stores and  installation  of  automatic  teller
          machines in various stores.

In connection with Valero's  acquisitions of the Paulsboro  Refinery in 1998 and
Basis  Petroleum,  Inc. in 1997, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in
any of the five years and ten years, respectively,  following these acquisitions
if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified
level.  Any payments due under these earn-out  arrangements are limited based on
annual and aggregate limits.  In May 2002,  Valero made an earn-out  contingency
payment of $23.9 million to Salomon Inc in connection with Valero's  acquisition
of Basis Petroleum,  Inc.  No earn-out amount was payable in 2002 related to the
Paulsboro Refinery acquisition. Based on estimated margin levels through May and
September 2003,  earn-out payments of approximately $35 million and $11 million,
respectively, would be due to the sellers during 2003.

In September 2002,  Valero  executed a nonbinding  letter of intent with El Paso
Energy  Partners L.P.  (EPN) to become a 50% partner in the Cameron  Highway Oil
Pipeline Project, a crude oil pipeline construction project. When completed, the
Cameron  Highway Oil  Pipeline is  expected to be a 390-mile  pipeline  that can
deliver up to 500,000  barrels per day of crude oil from major deepwater Gulf of
Mexico   fields   directly   to   major   refining   facilities   and   pipeline
interconnections  in Port Arthur and Texas City,  Texas.  Valero and EPN plan to
fund the project through permanent project debt financing, which would provide a
significant portion of the project's capital requirements and be non-recourse to
the partners.  Valero's participation is subject to negotiation and execution of
definitive  agreements.  Valero's equity investment in the project over the next
three  years  is  estimated  to  be   approximately   $140  million,   of  which
approximately  $110  million is expected to be spent during the second and third
quarters of 2003, subject to closing of certain financing agreements.

For  2003,  Valero  expects  to  incur  approximately  $1  billion  for  capital
investments,  including  approximately  $900  million for  capital  expenditures
(approximately  $500  million  of  which  is  for  environmental  projects)  and
approximately  $100 million for deferred  turnaround  and  catalyst  costs.  The
capital  expenditure  estimate  excludes  approximately  $170  million  and  $61
million,  respectively,  related to a coker  facility at the Texas City Refinery
and the planned expansion of the former UDS headquarters facility, which will be
Valero's new corporate  headquarters.  The coker and headquarters facilities are
being funded through structured lease arrangements (see the discussion below and
Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  The capital expenditure
estimate  also  excludes  anticipated   expenditures  related  to  the  earn-out
contingency  agreements  discussed  above,  the funding of the proposed  Cameron
Highway Oil Pipeline  Project,  and the purchase of an office  building  that is
currently under a structured lease arrangement.  Valero  continuously  evaluates
its capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant.



Contractual Obligations
Valero's  contractual  obligations as of December 31, 2002 are summarized  below
(in millions). Payments for long-term debt are at stated values and exclude debt
related to bank  facilities,  which are  included in a separate  table under the
caption "Other Commercial Commitments" below.



Each of the components in the table above is described separately below.

Long-Term Debt
In April 2002,  Valero issued $1.8 billion of notes under its $3.5 billion shelf
registration  statement as follows:
     o    $300 million of 6.125% notes due April 15, 2007,
     o    $750 million of 6.875% notes due April 15, 2012, and
     o    $750 million of 7.5% notes due April 15, 2032.
The notes are  unsecured  and are  redeemable,  in whole or in part, at Valero's
option.  Proceeds  from this offering  were used to repay all  borrowings  under
Valero's $1.5 billion bridge loan facility  associated  with the UDS Acquisition
and reduce borrowings under Valero's revolving bank credit facilities.

In June 2002,  Valero L.P. and Valero  Logistics  Operations,  L.P. filed a $500
million universal shelf registration  statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  (SEC). In July 2002, Valero Logistics  Operations,  L.P. issued $100
million of 6.875% senior notes due 2012 under the  registration  statement.  The
notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valero Logistics
Operations, L.P.'s option. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay
$91.0 million outstanding under the Valero Logistics Operations,  L.P. revolving
credit facility and for general partnership purposes.

In July 2002,  $275 million of 8.625%  guaranteed  notes matured and were repaid
with borrowings under Valero's revolving bank credit facilities.

In November  2002,  Valero  issued under its shelf  registration  statement  $50
million  of  6.311%  notes  due   November   30,   2007.   Interest  is  payable
semi-annually.  The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part,
at Valero's option.

In December  2002,  Valero issued under its shelf  registration  statement  $180
million of senior notes due January 15, 2013.  The senior notes bear interest at
6.7%,  payable  semi-annually.  The notes are unsecured and are  redeemable,  in
whole or in part, at Valero's  option.  Almost all of these notes were issued in
exchange for the $150  million of 6.75% notes issued to the Valero  Pass-Through
Asset Trust  1997-1 in 1997 and to  terminate an option held by a third party to
purchase the 6.75% notes on December 15, 2002.

None of Valero's  agreements  have rating  agency  triggers  that would  require
Valero to post additional  collateral.  However,  in the event of a downgrade by
the rating agencies,  borrowings under some of Valero's bank credit  facilities,
structured leases and other arrangements  would become more expensive.  On March
6, 2003,  Moody's  Investors'  Service  downgraded its rating of Valero's senior



unsecured debt to Baa3 with a stable outlook from Baa2 with a negative  outlook.
The reduction was  attributed  to high debt levels,  expectations  regarding the
sustainability of refining margins, and Valero's aggressive growth strategy.  On
March 10, 2003,  Standard & Poor's  Ratings  Services  reaffirmed  its rating on
Valero's senior unsecured debt at BBB with a negative outlook.

Operating Lease Obligations
Valero's operating lease obligations  include leases for land, office facilities
and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities,  transportation
equipment,   and  various   facilities   and  equipment  used  in  the  storage,
transportation,  production  and  sale  of  refined  products.  Operating  lease
obligations  include  all  operating  leases  that  have  initial  or  remaining
noncancelable  terms in excess of one year but  exclude  minimum  rentals  to be
received by Valero under  subleases.  Operating lease  obligations  also include
long-term  operating lease commitments that have been funded through  structured
lease arrangements with non-consolidated third-party entities as discussed below
under the caption  "Off-Balance  Sheet  Arrangements" and in Note 22 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Purchase Obligations
A purchase  obligation  is an  enforceable  and  legally  binding  agreement  to
purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed
or minimum  quantities to be purchased,  (ii) fixed,  minimum or variable  price
provisions,  and (iii) the  approximate  timing of the  transaction.  Valero has
various  purchase  obligations  including  industrial  gas and  chemical  supply
arrangements  (such  as  hydrogen  supply  arrangements),  crude  oil and  other
feedstock   supply   arrangements   and  various   throughput  and  terminalling
agreements.  Valero enters into these  contracts to ensure an adequate supply of
utilities,  feedstock  and storage to operate its  refineries.  Many of Valero's
purchase  obligations are based on market prices or adjustments  based on market
indices.  Certain of these purchase  obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements,  while  others  are  based on  Valero's  usage  requirements.  The
purchase  obligation amounts included in the table above include agreements that
have  remaining  noncancelable  terms in excess of one year as of  December  31,
2002,  and are based on expected  quantities  to be purchased  and/or  estimated
prices to be paid based on current market conditions. Valero has not made in the
past,  nor does it expect  to make in the  future,  payments  for  feedstock  or
services that it has not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess
of then prevailing market conditions.

Other Commercial Commitments
Valero's  other  commercial  commitments as of December 31, 2002 were as follows
(in millions):





As of  December  31,  2002,  Valero's  committed  lines of credit  included  (in
millions):


In September  2002,  Valero amended the interest  coverage ratio covenant in its
various bank credit facilities and structured lease arrangements.  The amendment
provides that Valero's trailing four-quarter interest coverage ratio must not be
less than:
     o    2.4 times for the  fourth  quarter  of 2002 and the first  quarter  of
          2003,
     o    2.5 times for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003, and
     o    2.75 times thereafter.

In November 2002,  Valero renewed its $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit
facility.

Under Valero's revolving bank credit facilities, Valero's debt-to-capitalization
ratio (net of cash) was 50.4% as of  December  31,  2002.  For  purposes of this
computation,  50% of the  $200  million  of  8.32%  Trust  Originated  Preferred
Securities  assumed  in the UDS  Acquisition  and 20% of the  $172.5  million of
aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities issued as part of the
PEPS Units were included as debt.

As of  December  31,  2002,  Valero  had  $147.1  million  of  letters of credit
outstanding  under its  uncommitted  short-term  bank credit  facilities,  $99.8
million of letters of credit  outstanding  under its  committed  facilities  and
Cdn.$6.4 million of letters of credit outstanding under its Canadian facility.

In March 2003,  the  revolving  credit  facility  for Valero L.P. was amended to
increase the borrowing capacity to $175 million.

Valero  believes  it has  sufficient  funds from  operations,  and to the extent
necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund
its  ongoing  operating  requirements.   Valero  expects  that,  to  the  extent
necessary,  it can raise  additional  funds from time to time through  equity or
debt financings.  However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability
of any future  financings or whether such  financings  can be made  available on
terms acceptable to Valero.

Valero's refining and marketing  operations have a concentration of customers in
the refining  industry and customers  who are refined  product  wholesalers  and
retailers.  These  concentrations  of  customers  may  impact  Valero's  overall
exposure  to  credit  risk,  either  positively  or  negatively,  in that  these
customers may be similarly  affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
However,   Valero  believes  that  its  portfolio  of  accounts   receivable  is
sufficiently  diversified to the extent  necessary to minimize  potential credit
risk.  Historically,  Valero has not had any significant problems collecting its
accounts receivable.

Valero L.P
Effective March 18, 2003, Valero received approximately $500 million of proceeds
from Valero L.P.  resulting  from the  contribution  by Valero to Valero L.P. of
certain storage tanks and a refined products  pipeline system and the redemption
by Valero L.P. of 3.8 million common units held by Valero,  as discussed in Note
26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Equity
Under common stock repurchase  programs approved by Valero's Board of Directors,
Valero  repurchases  shares  of its  common  stock  from time to time for use in
connection with its employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes.
During 2002, Valero  repurchased shares of its common stock under these programs
at a cost of  $45.5  million.  Through  February  2003,  Valero  has not had any
significant additional common share repurchases under these programs.

Environmental Matters
Valero is subject to extensive federal,  state and local  environmental laws and
regulations,  including  those  relating to the discharge of materials  into the
environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics
and  composition of gasoline and  distillates.  Because  environmental  laws and
regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new  environmental  laws
and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed,  the level of future
expenditures  required for environmental matters will increase in the future. In
addition,  any  major  upgrades  in any of  Valero's  refineries  could  require
material   additional   expenditures  to  comply  with  environmental  laws  and
regulations.   For  additional   information  regarding  Valero's  environmental
matters, including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental
regulations, see "Environmental Matters" in Items 1. & 2. Business & Properties.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility
In connection with the UDS Acquisition,  Valero assumed a $360 million revolving
accounts  receivable  sales  facility,  under which Valero  could sell  eligible
credit card and trade  accounts  receivable on an ongoing basis through a wholly
owned  subsidiary to a  third-party  financial  institution.  Valero also had an
existing  accounts  receivable  sales  facility  with  a  third-party  financial
institution  to sell on a revolving  basis up to $100 million of eligible  trade
accounts  receivable as of December 31, 2001, which was increased during 2002 to
$150 million.  On October 8, 2002,  Valero renewed and amended its agreement to,
among other things,  increase the size of its facility from $150 million to $250
million,  incorporate  credit card  receivables  into the program and extend the
maturity  date to October  2005.  The assumed UDS  facility  was  terminated  in
connection with the renewal and amendment of the Valero facility. Under Valero's
program,  a wholly owned  subsidiary  of Valero  sells an  undivided  percentage
ownership  interest  in  the  eligible  receivables,   without  recourse,  to  a
third-party financial institution.  Valero remains responsible for servicing the
transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables
under the program.  As of December 31, 2002, the amount of eligible  receivables
sold to the third-party financial institution was $250 million.



Structured Lease Arrangements
As  of  December  31,  2002,  Valero  had  various  long-term   operating  lease
commitments  that have been funded through  structured lease  arrangements  with
non-consolidated third-party entities, which are summarized below (in millions):


Valero  entered  into  these  structured  lease  arrangements  with  third-party
entities that  constructed  or purchased the related assets and then leased them
to Valero.  The assets held by these  third-party  entities were funded  through
borrowings by these  entities and equity  contributions  equal to at least 3% of
the asset cost.  Neither Valero, its affiliates nor any related parties hold any
interest in these  entities.  For each lease,  Valero has the option to purchase
the  leased  assets  at  any  time  during  the  lease  term  for a  price  that
approximates  fair  value.  After the  initial  lease  term,  the  leases may be
extended by agreement of the parties.  In the case of the headquarters  facility
lease,  if Valero  exercises its renewal  option at the end of the primary lease
term,  Valero will be required to provide cash  collateral in an amount equal to
the residual value guarantee,  which is currently  estimated to be approximately
$146 million.  The various  structured lease  arrangements also permit Valero to
sell the  leased  properties  to one or more  third  parties,  in which case the
leases provide for maximum residual value guarantees  ranging from 82% to 87% of
the  appraised  value of the leased  properties at the end of the lease term, as
determined at the inception of the lease.

Valero uses these structured lease arrangements to provide additional  liquidity
to fund its ongoing  operations.  Except for the proposed  purchase of an office
building that is subject to a lease that expires in April 2003,  Valero believes
that it is not  reasonably  likely that it will purchase  these leased assets at
any time during their lease terms and would likely renew,  to the extent that it
can, the leases for such assets under similar arrangements.  However,  there can
be  no  assurance   regarding  the  availability  of  future   structured  lease
arrangements  or  whether  such  arrangements  can be made  available  on  terms
acceptable to Valero. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements
for a  discussion  of FASB  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable
Interest Entities," and its potential effect on Valero's consolidated  financial
statements.

Guarantees
In  connection  with the sale of the Golden Eagle  Business,  Valero  guaranteed
certain lease payment  obligations  related to an MTBE facility lease assumed by
Tesoro, which totaled approximately $46 million as of December 31, 2002.

Valero's  structured  lease  arrangements  provide  for maximum  residual  value
guarantees  ranging  from  82%  to  87% of the  appraised  value  of the  leased
properties  at the end of the lease term,  as determined at the inception of the
lease. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum residual value guarantee on Valero's
structured lease arrangments was approximately $541 million.



NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  certain
new  financial  accounting  pronouncements  have been issued  which  either have
already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or
will become effective for Valero's financial  statements at various dates in the
future. The adoption of these  pronouncements has not had, or is not expected to
have, a material effect on Valero's consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with United  States
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.  The following  summary provides further  information  about Valero's
critical  accounting  policies and should be read in conjunction  with Note 1 of
Notes  to  Consolidated   Financial   Statements,   which  summarizes   Valero's
significant accounting policies.

Inventories
Inventories  are  stated at the lower of cost or  market.  The cost of  refinery
feedstocks  purchased for processing and produced  products are determined under
the  last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  method  of  inventory  pricing.  The  cost  of
feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies
and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted average cost
method.  Valero utilizes the dollar-value  LIFO method and uses average purchase
prices during the year to value any increments to its LIFO inventory.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Valero records depreciation  expense on its property,  plant and equipment using
the  composite   method  of   depreciation.   Under  the  composite   method  of
depreciation,  the costs of minor property units, net of salvage value,  retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated  depreciation while gains or
losses on sales or other  dispositions  of major  units are  recorded in income.
Accounting  for property,  plant and equipment  requires  various  judgments and
estimates,  including a determination of remaining useful lives,  salvage values
and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and
losses.

In June 2001, the American  Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  (AICPA)
issued an exposure  draft of a proposed  Statement  of Position  (SOP)  entitled
"Accounting  for Certain  Costs and  Activities  Related to Property,  Plant and
Equipment," in which  accounting for  depreciation  and replacement of property,
plant and equipment was addressed.  The exposure draft  concluded that component
accounting  for a replacement of property,  plant and equipment  should occur at
the time of  replacement.  If an entity  replaces part of a property,  plant and
equipment asset that has not previously  been accounted for as a component,  and
the  replacement  meets the  definition  of a component,  then the entity should
capitalize the cost of the replacement,  account for it as a separate component,
estimate the net book value of the replaced  item, and charge the net book value
of the  replaced  item to  depreciation  expense in the  period of  replacement.
Therefore, a consequence of not previously applying component accounting is that
the net book value of the replaced  item is charged to  depreciation  expense in
the period of the replacement, with net book value calculated using the expected
useful  life of the  total  property,  plant  and  equipment  asset to which the
component  relates.  In addition,  if the  provisions of the exposure  draft are
enacted and component rather than composite accounting is required,  significant
additional estimates and judgments will be required due to the additional volume
of assets to be accounted for  individually.  In February 2003, the FASB and the
AICPA met to deliberate  certain  aspects of the proposed SOP. The status of the
proposed  SOP remains  unchanged.  Valero is unable to  estimate  when or if the
proposed SOP will be enacted.


Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
In  connection  with the UDS  Acquisition,  Valero  recognized  goodwill of $2.6
billion and intangible assets of approximately $279 million.  FASB Statement No.
142,   "Goodwill   and  Other   Intangible   Assets,"   requires  that  goodwill
andintangible  assets that have indefinite useful lives are not to be amortized,
but instead must be tested for impairment  annually or more frequently if events
or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  asset  might  be  impaired.
Intangible  assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized
and  should  be  reviewed  for   impairment   whenever   events  or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of the  asset  may  not be
recoverable.

Impairment  testing  requires that an entity determine the fair value of each of
its reporting  units.  In order to determine  fair value,  management  must make
certain estimates and assumptions  including,  among other things, an assessment
of market conditions,  projected cash flows,  investment rates,  interest/equity
rates and growth rates,  that could  significantly  impact the reported value of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Due to the significant subjectivity of the
assumptions  used to determine  the fair value of a reporting  unit,  changes in
market conditions could result in significant  impairment charges in the future,
thus affecting Valero's earnings.

Refinery Turnaround Costs
Refinery  turnaround costs,  which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance  activities at Valero's  refineries,  are deferred when incurred and
amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the period of time  estimated to lapse
until the next turnaround occurs.  The frequency of refinery  turnarounds varies
with each refinery  operating  unit. As of December 31, 2002,  Valero had $185.0
million of refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet.

The AICPA's  exposure draft of a proposed SOP entitled  "Accounting  for Certain
Costs and Activities Related to Property,  Plant and Equipment," discussed above
under "Property,  Pland and Equipment," also addressed  accounting for the costs
of planned major maintenance  activities.  The exposure draft concluded that the
total cost of planned major maintenance  activities cannot be deferred, but that
the  individual  costs  incurred in such planned  major  maintenance  activities
should be evaluated to determine if they represent the acquisition of additional
components or the replacement of existing  components.  All other costs incurred
in a  planned  major  maintenance  activity  should be  charged  to  expense  as
incurred.  If the  provisions of the exposure  draft are enacted and  turnaround
costs are ultimately expensed as incurred, Valero's reported income would become
more  volatile.  In  February  2003,  the FASB and the AICPA  met to  deliberate
certain  aspects of the  proposed  SOP.  The status of the  proposed SOP remains
unchanged.  Valero is unable to  estimate  when or if the  proposed  SOP will be
enacted.  Management of Valero  estimates that if the provisions of the exposure
draft had been applicable  during 2002,  Valero's reported net income would have
been reduced by approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Income Taxes
As part of the process of preparing  consolidated  financial statements,  Valero
must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered
through future taxable  income.  To the extent Valero  believes that recovery is
not likely, a valuation  allowance must be established.  Significant  management
judgment is required in determining  any valuation  allowance  recorded  against
deferred  income tax assets.  Valero has  recorded a valuation  allowance  as of
December  31,  2002 and 2001,  due to  uncertainties  related to its  ability to
utilize some of its deferred income tax assets,  primarily consisting of certain
state net  operating  losses  carried  forward and  foreign tax credits  carried
forward,  before  they  expire.  The  valuation  allowance  is based on Valero's
estimates of taxable  income in the various  jurisdictions  in which it operates
and the period over which  deferred  income tax assets will be  recoverable.  If
actual  results  differ from the  estimates or Valero  adjusts the  estimates in
future  periods,  Valero may need to revise  the  valuation  allowance.  The net
deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2002 were $783.8 million, net of a
valuation allowance of $39.1 million.


Environmental Liabilities
Valero's  operations are subject to environmental  regulation by federal,  state
and local  authorities  relating  primarily to  discharge of materials  into the
environment,   waste  management  and  pollution  prevention  measures.   Future
legislative  action  and  regulatory  initiatives  could  result in  changes  to
required  operating  permits,  additional  remedial actions or increased capital
expenditures  and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this
time.  Accruals for  environmental  liabilities  are based on best  estimates of
probable  undiscounted  future costs using  currently  available  technology and
applying  current  regulations,  as well as Valero's own internal  environmental
policies.  Valero believes that it has adequately  accrued for its environmental
exposures.  However,  environmental  liabilities  are  difficult  to assess  and
estimate   due  to   uncertainties   related  to  the   magnitude   of  possible
contamination,  the timing  and  extent of  remediation,  the  determination  of
Valero's  liability in  proportion  to other  parties,  improvements  in cleanup
technologies,  and the extent to which  environmental  laws and  regulations may
change in the future.

Price Risk Management Activities
Valero's  financial  position and results of operations are affected by the type
of  derivative  instruments  and the  degree  of hedge  accounting  utilized  by
Valero's  management to  accommodate  Valero's risk  management  strategies  and
overall risk exposure levels.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
Valero has significant pension and postretirement  benefit liabilities and costs
that are developed from actuarial  valuations.  Inherent in these valuations are
key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future
compensation  increases  and  health  care cost  trend  rates.  Changes in these
assumptions are primarily  influenced by factors outside Valero's  control.  For
example, the discount rate assumption is based on Moody's published Aa corporate
bond rate as of the end of each year,  while the expected  return on plan assets
is based on a compounded return  calculated for Valero by an outside  consultant
using  historical  market  index  data  from  1926  through  2001  with an asset
allocation  of 65%  equities and 35% bonds,  representative  of the asset mix in
Valero's  pension plan. These  assumptions can have a significant  effect on the
amounts reported in Valero's consolidated  financial statements.  For example, a
0.25%  decrease  in the  assumptions  related to the  discount  rate or expected
return on plan  assets or a 0.25%  increase  in the  assumptions  related to the
health  care cost trend  rate or rate of  compensation  increase  would have the
following  effects on the projected  benefit  obligation as of December 31, 2002
and net  periodic  benefit  cost  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2003  (in
millions):

                                                                     Other
                                                  Pension       Postretirement

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

Valero is exposed to market  risks  related to the  volatility  of crude oil and
refined product  prices,  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used
in its  refining  operations.  In  order to  reduce  the  risks  of these  price
fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of
its refinery  feedstock  and refined  product  inventories  and a portion of its
unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges).
Valero also uses  derivative  commodity  instruments  to hedge the price risk of
forecasted  transactions such as forecasted  feedstock and natural gas purchases
and  refined  product  sales  (cash  flow  hedges).  In  addition,  Valero  uses
derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a
portion of its refined product  inventories and on certain forecasted  feedstock
and refined product  purchases that do not receive hedge  accounting  treatment.
These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in
their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales.  Finally,  Valero uses
derivative  commodity  instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental
and technical analysis of market conditions.

The  types of  instruments  used in  Valero's  hedging  and  trading  activities
described  above  include  swaps,  futures and  options.  Valero's  positions in
derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a
risk control group to ensure  compliance  with Valero's  stated risk  management
policy which has been  approved by Valero's  Board of  Directors.

The following tables provide  information  about Valero's  derivative  commodity
instruments  as of December 31, 2002 and 2001  (dollars in millions,  except for
the weighted-average pay and receive prices as described below), including:
     o    fair value hedges held to hedge refining  inventories and unrecognized
          firm commitments,
     o    cash  flow  hedges  held to  hedge  forecasted  feedstock  or  product
          purchases and refined product sales,
     o    economic hedges held to:
          o    manage price volatility in refined product inventories, and
          o    manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock,  natural gas and
               refined  product  purchases,  and
     o    trading activities held or issued for trading purposes.

Contract  volumes  are  presented  in  thousands  of barrels  (for crude oil and
refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The
weighted-average  pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude
oil and refined  products)  or amounts per million  British  thermal  units (for
natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used
to calculate amounts due under the agreements. The gain (loss) on swaps is equal
to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the
pay price times the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the gain
(loss)  represents  (i) the excess of the fair value  amount  over the  contract
amount for long  positions,  or (ii) the excess of the contract  amount over the
fair value amount for short  positions.  Additionally,  for futures and options,
the  weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions
and the  weighted-average  receive price represents the contract price for short
positions. The weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for
options  represents  their strike price.  All derivative  commodity  instruments
assumed in connection  with the UDS  Acquisition  were recorded at fair value on
December  31,  2001;  therefore  no gain  (loss) is shown as of that date in the
tables below.  Accordingly,  swaps assumed in the UDS Acquisition have zero fair
value as of December 31, 2001 as the  weighted-average pay price is equal to the
weighted-average receive price. Additionally, for futures and options assumed in
the UDS  Acquisition,  the  contract  amount  is equal to the fair  value of the
assumed contracts as of December 31, 2001.









In addition to the above,  as of December 31,  2001,  Valero was the fixed price
payor under  certain  swap  contracts  held to hedge  anticipated  purchases  of
refinery  feedstocks  and refined  products  that  matured in August  2002,  had
notional  volumes  totaling   approximately  7.5  million  barrels,  and  had  a
weighted-average  pay price of $20.11 per barrel. As of December 31, 2001, these
swaps had a  weighted-average  receive  price of  $20.53  per  barrel  and a net
after-tax  gain  recorded in other  comprehensive  income of  approximately  $17
million.  In connection  with the UDS  Acquisition,  Valero assumed certain swap
contracts under which it was the fixed price payor under contracts held to hedge
anticipated  purchases of refinery  feedstocks and refined products that matured
in June 2002, had notional volumes totaling  approximately  6.4 million barrels,
and had a  weighted  average  pay  price of  $22.20  per  barrel.  Since the UDS
contracts  were  acquired  on December  31,  2001 at fair  value,  no amount was
recorded in other comprehensive income.



INTEREST RATE RISK

Valero's  primary  market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to
its long-term debt obligations. Valero manages its exposure to changing interest
rates  through the use of a  combination  of fixed and  floating  rate debt.  In
addition,  Valero utilizes  interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of
the exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed-rate debt to
floating rate. In connection  with the UDS  Acquisition,  Valero assumed certain
interest  rate swap  agreements  entered into in order to manage  interest  rate
exposure on certain fixed-rate debt obligations.

The following  table  provides  information  about  Valero's  long-term debt and
interest rate derivative  instruments (in millions,  except interest rates), all
of which are  sensitive  to changes  in  interest  rates.  For  long-term  debt,
principal  cash flows and related  weighted-average  interest  rates by expected
maturity  dates are  presented.  For  interest  rate swaps,  the table  presents
notional amounts and weighted-average  interest rates by expected  (contractual)
maturity dates.  Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments
to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted-average floating rates are based on
implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.




FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

Valero enters into foreign  currency  exchange and purchase  contracts to manage
its  exposure to  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on  transactions  related to its
Canadian  operations.  During May 2002,  Valero  entered into  foreign  currency
exchange  contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange  rate  fluctuations  on an
investment in its Canadian operations.  Under these contracts,  Valero sold $400
million of Canadian  dollars and bought $253.4  million of U.S.  dollars.  As of
December 31, 2002,  these  contracts had a fair value of $6.1 million.  The gain
recognized  in income on these  contracts,  which was $6.1  million for the year
ended  December 31, 2002,  was offset by a loss of $2.4  million  recognized  in
income from the effect of the exchange rate fluctuation on the hedged investment
for the year. These contracts mature as follows (in millions):

                     Year Ending            Notional
                     December 31,            Amount
                     ------------            ------
                       2003.........        $ 50.9
                       2004.........          37.9
                       2005.........          31.7
                       2006.........          38.1
                       2007.........          94.8
                                              ----
                       Total........       $ 253.4
                                             =====

As of December 31, 2002,  Valero had  commitments  to purchase  $33.8 million of
U.S.  dollars.  Valero's  market  risk was  minimal on these  contracts  as they
matured on or before January 3, 2003.






ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA


                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet of Valero Energy
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  (the  Company) as of December 31, 2002,  and the
related consolidated statements of income,  stockholders' equity, cash flows and
comprehensive income for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion  on these  financial  statements  based on our audit.  The  consolidated
financial  statements of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the
two years in the period ended December 31, 2001,  were audited by other auditors
who have ceased  operations  and whose report  dated March 5, 2002  expressed an
unqualified opinion on those statements before the revisions described below and
in Notes 20 and 27.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position of Valero Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002, and the consolidated  results
of their  operations  and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed above, the consolidated  financial  statements of the Company as of
December  31, 2001,  and for each of the two years in the period ended  December
31,  2001,  were  audited  by other  auditors  who have  ceased  operations.  As
described in Notes 20 and 27, these consolidated  financial statements have been
revised. We audited (i) the  reclassification  adjustments applied to revise the
segment  disclosures  in Note  20,  and (ii)  the  reclassification  adjustments
discussed in Note 27, that were applied to revise the 2001 and 2000 consolidated
financial  statements.  In our opinion,  such  reclassification  adjustments are
appropriate  and have been  properly  applied.  However,  we were not engaged to
audit,  review,  or apply  any  procedures  to the  2001  and 2000  consolidated
financial   statements   of  the  Company   other  than  with  respect  to  such
reclassification  adjustments and, accordingly,  we do not express an opinion or
any  other  form of  assurance  on the  2001  and  2000  consolidated  financial
statements taken as a whole.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
As used in this report, the term Valero may refer to Valero Energy  Corporation,
one or more of its consolidated  subsidiaries,  or all of them taken as a whole.
Valero,  an  independent  refining and marketing  company,  owns and operates 12
refineries  (five  in  Texas,  two in  California  and  one  each  in  Colorado,
Louisiana,  New Jersey,  Oklahoma and Quebec, Canada) with a combined throughput
capacity of  approximately  1.9 million  barrels per day. Valero markets refined
products  through an extensive bulk and rack marketing  network and a network of
approximately 4,100 retail outlets in the United States and eastern Canada under
various brand names including  Diamond  Shamrock(R),  Shamrock(R),  Ultramar(R),
Valero(R),  Beacon(R),  Total(R) and Exxon(R).  Valero's operations are affected
by:
     o    company-specific  factors,  primarily  refinery  utilization rates and
          refinery maintenance turnarounds;
     o    seasonal  factors,  such as the demand for refined products during the
          summer driving season and heating oil during the winter season; and
     o    industry  factors,  such as  movements  in and the  level of crude oil
          prices, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply
          capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds.

These  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts of Valero and
subsidiaries  in which  Valero has a  controlling  interest.  As of December 31,
2002,  Valero owned 73.6% of Valero L.P.,  a limited  partnership  that owns and
operates crude oil and refined product pipeline, terminalling and storage assets
that support certain of Valero's  refineries.  Accordingly,  these  consolidated
financial  statements include the accounts of Valero L.P.  Investments in 50% or
less owned  entities are accounted  for using the equity  method of  accounting.
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with United  States
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.  On an ongoing  basis,  management  reviews  its  estimates  based on
currently available  information.  Changes in facts and circumstances may result
in revised estimates.

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments
Valero's temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments
which have a maturity of three months or less when acquired.  Cash and temporary
cash  investments   exclude  cash  that  is  not  available  to  Valero  due  to
restrictions related to its use. Such amounts are segregated in the consolidated
balance sheets in restricted cash.

Inventories
Inventories  are  carried at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of  refinery
feedstocks  purchased for processing and produced  products are determined under
the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method.  Valero uses the dollar-value LIFO method
with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year. The
cost of feedstocks and products  purchased for resale and the cost of materials,
supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined  principally under the
weighted-average cost method.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Property, Plant and Equipment
Additions to property,  plant and equipment,  including capitalized interest and
certain costs allocable to construction and property purchases,  are recorded at
cost.

The costs of minor  property  units (or  components of property  units),  net of
salvage  value,  retired or  abandoned  are charged or  credited to  accumulated
depreciation  under the  composite  method of  depreciation.  Gains or losses on
sales or other dispositions of major units of property are recorded in income.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment,  including amortization of assets
acquired under capital leases,  is recorded  primarily on a straight-line  basis
over  the  estimated   useful  lives  of  the  related   facilities.   Leasehold
improvements  are amortized using the  straight-line  method over the shorter of
the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of
the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Intangible
assets are assets that lack physical substance  (excluding financial assets). In
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 142,  "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets," issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB),  goodwill  acquired in a business  combination  completed after June 30,
2001 and intangible  assets with  indefinite  useful lives are not amortized and
intangible  assets with finite useful lives are amortized.  Effective January 1,
2002,  Valero  adopted the  provisions  of  Statement  No. 142  resulting  in no
significant impact to the consolidated  financial statements.  The provisions of
Statement  No. 142 require that  goodwill and  intangible  assets not subject to
amortization  be tested for impairment  annually or more frequently if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate the asset might be impaired.  Valero adopted
October 1st of each year as its annual valuation date for the impairment test.

Intangible  assets are recorded at their fair values on the date of  acquisition
and are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

Deferred Charges and Other Assets
Deferred charges and other assets include the following:
     o    refinery  turnaround  costs,  which are  incurred in  connection  with
          planned  major  maintenance  activities  at Valero's  refineries,  are
          deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
          period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs;
     o    fixed-bed catalyst costs, which represent the cost of catalyst that is
          changed out at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has
          deteriorated  beyond  its  prescribed  function,   are  deferred  when
          incurred and  amortized on a  straight-line  basis over the  estimated
          useful life of the specific catalyst;
     o    investments  in 50% or less owned  entities,  which are  accounted for
          using the equity method of accounting; and
     o    other noncurrent  assets such as notes  receivable,  prefunded benefit
          costs, debt issuance costs and various other costs.

Taxes Other than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income  taxes  includes  primarily  liabilities  for ad valorem
taxes, excise taxes and payroll taxes.



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Under this
method,  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized for the future tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases.  Deferred  amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable  income in the year those  temporary  differences  are expected to be
recovered or settled.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional  currency of Valero's Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar.
The translation  into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using
exchange  rates in effect  as of the  balance  sheet  date and for  revenue  and
expense  accounts  using the  weighted-average  exchange  rate  during the year.
Adjustments  resulting from this translation are reported in other comprehensive
income.

Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recorded when title to products sold has been  transferred  or when
services have been provided.

Product Shipping and Handling Costs
Costs  incurred  for  shipping  and handling of products are included in cost of
sales in the consolidated statements of income.

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Effective January 1, 2002, Valero adopted Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment  or  Disposal  of  Long-Lived   Assets,"  which  addresses  financial
accounting  and  reporting  for the  impairment  of  long-lived  assets  and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of. Statement No. 144 supersedes:
     o    Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
          and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and
     o    Accounting  Principles  Board  (APB)  Opinion No. 30,  "Reporting  the
          Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment
          of a Business,  and Extraordinary,  Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
          Events and Transactions" for segments of a business to be disposed of.

Long-lived assets  (excluding  goodwill,  intangible  assets with  indeterminate
lives, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events or
changes  in  circumstances   indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be
recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the
carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from  the  use  and  eventual  disposition  of the  asset.  If an  asset  is not
recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying
amount  of the  long-lived  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value,  with  fair  value
determined based on discounted  estimated net cash flows. There was no impact to
Valero's  consolidated  financial  statements  as a result of  adoption  of this
statement.

As of December 31, 2001,  Valero classified  certain  long-lived assets held for
disposal as assets held for sale (see Note 6). Since these assets were committed
to be disposed of under a plan  established  prior to the  adoption of Statement
No. 144,  they were  accounted  for in  accordance  with  Statement No. 121, APB
Opinion No. 30 and other  relevant  pronouncements  that preceded  Statement No.
144.



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Environmental Matters
Liabilities  for  future  remediation  costs  are  recorded  when  environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated.  Other  than for  assessments,  the  timing  and  magnitude  of these
accruals  are  generally  based on the  completion  of  investigations  or other
studies or a commitment  to a formal plan of action.  Environmental  liabilities
are  based  on best  estimates  of  probable  undiscounted  future  costs  using
currently  available  technology and applying  current  regulations,  as well as
Valero's own internal environmental policies. The environmental liabilities have
not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties of amounts payable by
Valero.

Price Risk Management Activities
Effective  January 1, 2001,  Valero adopted  Statement No. 133,  "Accounting for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities," as amended.  Statement No. 133
established  accounting and reporting  standards for derivative  instruments and
for hedging activities.  Under Statement No. 133, all derivative instruments are
recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities  measured at their
fair value.  Changes in a derivative's  fair value are  recognized  currently in
income unless  specific  hedge  accounting  criteria are met.  Statement No. 133
allows  special hedge  accounting  for  derivative  instruments  designated  and
qualifying  as a fair value  hedge or a cash flow  hedge.  The gain or loss on a
derivative  instrument  designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well
as the  offsetting  loss or gain on the hedged item  attributable  to the hedged
risk,  are  recognized  currently  in income in the same period.  The  effective
portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying
as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component  of other  comprehensive  income
and is  reclassified  into income in the same period or periods during which the
hedged forecasted  transaction affects income. The remaining ineffective portion
of the  gain  or loss  on the  derivative  instrument,  if  any,  is  recognized
currently  in income.  The  adoption of this  statement  has not resulted in any
significant  changes in Valero's business  practices,  including its hedging and
trading  activities as described below;  however,  various system  modifications
have been required.

When Valero enters into a derivative instrument, the derivative is designated as
a fair  value  hedge,  a  cash  flow  hedge,  an  economic  hedge  or a  trading
instrument.  For those derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges,
Valero formally documents,  at inception,  the hedging relationship and its risk
management  objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the hedge as required by
Statement No. 133.

Valero accounts for its hedging relationships  designated and qualifying as fair
value  hedges  or cash  flow  hedges  in  accordance  with the  requirements  of
Statement  No. 133.  For Valero's  economic  hedging  relationships  (hedges not
designated  as fair value or cash flow  hedges) and for  derivative  instruments
entered  into by Valero for  trading  purposes,  the  derivative  instrument  is
recorded  at fair  value and the gain or loss on the  derivative  instrument  is
recognized currently in income.

Valero discontinues hedge accounting  prospectively if (i) it is determined that
the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value
or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, (ii) the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated,  or exercised, or (iii) the derivative is no longer designated
as a hedging  instrument.  In any of these  circumstances,  Valero may designate
prospectively a new hedging  relationship  with a new hedging  instrument or, in
the case of (i) or (iii), a different hedged item or hedged transaction.

When a cash flow hedge is  discontinued,  Valero continues to report the related
net derivative gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive  income until the
hedged forecasted  transaction  affects income, at which time the net derivative


                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


gain or loss is reclassified  into income.  However,  if it is probable that the
forecasted  transaction  will  not  occur  either  by the end of the  originally
specified time period or within two months thereafter,  Valero  reclassifies the
related derivative gain or loss from accumulated other comprehensive income into
income immediately.

Financial Instruments
Valero's  financial  instruments  include cash and temporary  cash  investments,
restricted cash,  receivables,  payables,  debt, interest rate swaps,  commodity
contracts,  and foreign currency  contracts.  The estimated fair values of these
financial  instruments  approximate  their  carrying  values as reflected in the
consolidated  balance sheets,  except for certain long-term debt as discussed in
Note 11.  The fair  value of  Valero's  debt,  interest  rate  swaps,  commodity
contracts and foreign currency  contracts was estimated based on year-end quoted
market prices.

Stock-Based Compensation
Valero  accounts for its employee stock  compensation  plans using the intrinsic
value  method of  accounting  set forth in APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for
Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related  interpretations  as  permitted  by
Statement  No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation."  Accordingly,
compensation  cost for stock  options is measured as the excess,  if any, of the
quoted  market price of Valero's  common stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and  Disclosure,"  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method
of accounting  for  stock-based  employee  compensation.  Statement No. 148 also
amended the  disclosure  provisions to require  prominent  disclosure  about the
effects on reported net income of an entity's  accounting  policy decisions with
respect to  stock-based  employee  compensation  and amended APB Opinion No. 28,
"Interim  Financial  Reporting,"  to require  disclosure  about those effects in
interim  financial  reports.  Statement  No.  148 was  effective  for  financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Since Valero has not
changed to the fair value based method of accounting  for  stock-based  employee
compensation,  there was no impact on Valero's  financial position or results of
operations as a result of adopting this statement.

The weighted-average  fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 was $9.55,  $11.60 and $9.64 per stock option,
respectively.  The fair value of each stock  option  grant was  estimated on the
grant  date using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model  with the  following
assumptions:

                                                 Year Ended December 31,
                                                 -----------------------
                                             2002         2001          2000
                                             ----         ----          ----

       Risk-free interest rate............    2.4%         4.4%          6.7%
       Expected volatility................   44.5%        46.1%         42.8%
       Expected dividend yield............    1.1%         1.2%          1.1%
       Expected life (years)..............    3.1          3.1           3.1

Because  Valero  accounts for its employee  stock  compensation  plans using the
intrinsic  value  method,  no  compensation  cost  has  been  recognized  in the
statements  of income for  Valero's  fixed  stock  option  plans as all  options


                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant.  Had  compensation  cost for  Valero's  fixed  stock
option plans been  determined  based on the grant-date  fair value of awards for
the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 consistent with the method set
forth in  Statement  No. 123,  Valero's net income and earnings per common share
for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below (in millions, except per share amounts):


For stock-based  compensation  awards other than fixed stock option awards,  the
after-tax compensation cost reflected in net income for the years ended December
31,  2002,  2001 and 2000 was $9.0  million,  $11.9  million  and $8.8  million,
respectively.

Earnings per Common Share
Earnings   per  common   share  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  by  the
weighted-average  number of common shares outstanding for the year. Earnings per
common share - assuming  dilution  reflects the  potential  dilution of Valero's
outstanding  stock  options  and  performance  awards  granted to  employees  in
connection  with Valero's stock  compensation  plans,  as well as the PEPS Units
discussed in Note 13.

Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting
stockholders'  equity that,  under United States generally  accepted  accounting
principles,  are excluded from net income, such as foreign currency  translation
adjustments,  minimum pension liability adjustments and gains and losses related
to certain derivative instruments.

Business Combinations
Effective   July  1,  2001,   Valero  adopted   Statement  No.  141,   "Business
Combinations."  All business  combinations in the scope of Statement No. 141 are
accounted  for using the purchase  method.  The  provisions of Statement No. 141
apply to all business  combinations  initiated  after June 30, 2001 and apply to



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


all business combinations  accounted for using the purchase method for which the
date of acquisition is July 1, 2001 or later.

Guarantees
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,  Including  Indirect  Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 addresses the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations
under  guarantees.  These disclosure  requirements  were effective for financial
statements of interim and annual  periods ending after December 15, 2002 and are
included  in Note 22. FIN 45 also  clarifies  that a  guarantor  is  required to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
the  obligation  undertaken  in  issuing  the  guarantee.  The  recognition  and
measurement  provisions of this  interpretation  are applicable on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.

New Accounting Pronouncements
FASB Statement No. 143
In June  2001,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset
Retirement  Obligations." This statement  establishes  financial  accounting and
reporting  standards for obligations  associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived  assets and the associated asset retirement  costs. The provisions of
this  statement  apply to legal  obligations  associated  with the retirement of
long-lived  assets that result from the acquisition,  construction,  development
and/or  the  normal  operation  of  a  long-lived  asset,   except  for  certain
obligations of lessees.  Valero will adopt this statement  effective  January 1,
2003, and is continuing to evaluate the effect of the statement on its financial
position and results of operations. However, Valero currently estimates that the
adoption  will not result in a significant  effect on its financial  position or
results of operations.

FASB Statement No. 146
In June  2002,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  No.  146,  "Accounting  for  Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities,"  which  addresses  accounting for
restructuring  and similar costs. Such costs include lease termination costs and
certain  employee  severance  costs that are  associated  with a  restructuring,
discontinued  operations,  plant closings or other exit or disposal  activities.
Statement No. 146 supercedes previous accounting guidance,  principally Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3.  Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability
for an exit cost was  recognized  at the date of the entity's  commitment  to an
exit or disposal  plan.  Statement No. 146 requires that the liability for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized,  at fair value, when
the liability is incurred. Valero will adopt the provisions of Statement No. 146
for restructuring activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

FASB Interpretation No. 46
In January  2003,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest  Entities," which is an interpretation of Accounting  Research
Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial  Statements."  Interpretation  No. 46
addresses  consolidation of variable interest entities (VIE), which are entities
where control  through voting equity interest is not clear and control should be
evaluated  based on the investors'  exposure to the economic risks and potential
rewards from the VIE's assets and activities  (variable  interest).  A VIE is an
entity  with  either of the  following  characteristics:  (a) the  total  equity
investment  at risk is not  sufficient  to  permit  the  entity to  finance  its
activities without additional  subordinated financial support, or (b) the equity
investors lack any characteristic of a controlling financial interest, including




                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


direct or indirect  ability to make  decisions  that control the entity  through
voting or similar rights, the investors' investment is subordinated to all other
interests,  or return to equity  investors is  unlimited.  An  enterprise  shall
consolidate a VIE if it is the primary  beneficiary  of the entity.  The primary
beneficiary is the enterprise  that absorbs a majority of the entity's  expected
losses,  receives a majority of its expected  residual  returns,  or both,  as a
result of holding a variable interest, which are the ownership,  contractual, or
other pecuniary interests in an entity.  Assets,  liabilities and noncontrolling
interests of newly  consolidated  VIEs generally  will be initially  measured at
their fair value except for assets and  liabilities  transferred to a VIE by its
primary beneficiary, which will be measured at historical cost.

Interpretation  No. 46 applies  immediately  to VIEs created  after  January 31,
2003, and to VIEs in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003
to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable interest created before February
1, 2003.  Interpretation  No. 46 may be applied  prospectively with a cumulative
effect  adjustment  as of the date on which it is first  adopted or by restating
previously  issued financial  statements for one or more years with a cumulative
effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. As of December
31,  2002,  Valero  held an  interest  in several  potential  VIEs and is in the
process of determining the effect of adoption on July 1, 2003.

Reclassifications
Certain  previously  reported  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the
2002 presentation as described in Note 27.

2. ACQUISITIONS

Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation
On December 31, 2001,  Valero  completed  its  acquisition  of Ultramar  Diamond
Shamrock Corporation (UDS), referred to as the UDS Acquisition.  Under the terms
of the  merger  agreement,  each  outstanding  share of UDS common  stock,  with
limited exceptions,  was converted into the right to receive cash, Valero common
stock,  or a combination  of cash and Valero  common stock at the  shareholder's
election,  subject  to  proration.  Based  on  the  exchange  election  results,
shareholders electing Valero common stock received, for each share of UDS common
stock,  approximately  0.9265  shares of Valero common stock and $16.32 in cash.
Shareholders electing cash and non-electing shareholders received $49.47 in cash
for each UDS share.  The average  closing  price of Valero  common stock for the
10-day  measurement period specified in the merger agreement (the 10-day trading
period  ending three days prior to the merger) was $35.78.  As a result,  Valero
issued 45.9 million  shares of Valero common stock and paid $2.1 billion of cash
to UDS shareholders.

UDS was an independent  refiner and retailer of refined products and convenience
store merchandise in the central,  southwest and northeast regions of the United
States and eastern Canada.  UDS owned and operated seven  refineries,  including
two in Texas, two in California, and one each in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Quebec,
Canada, with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 850,000 barrels per
day.  UDS  marketed  refined  products  and a broad range of  convenience  store
merchandise  through a network of approximately  4,500 convenience  stores under
the Diamond Shamrock(R),  Ultramar(R), Beacon(R) and Total(R) brand names. UDS's
operations, primarily in Canada, also included the marketing of refined products
through 86 cardlocks, which are card- or key-activated, self-service, unattended
stations that allow commercial, trucking and governmental fleets to buy gasoline
and diesel fuel 24 hours a day,  and a retail home  heating  oil  business  that
sells  heating  oil to approximately  250,000 households. As a condition for the

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


regulatory  approval of the acquisition,  the Federal Trade  Commission's  (FTC)
consent decree required Valero to divest the 168,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle
Refinery located in the San Francisco Bay Area, the related wholesale  marketing
business,  and 70 associated  Beacon- and  Ultramar-branded  convenience  stores
located throughout Northern California (see Note 6).

Financing of UDS Acquisition
Valero  financed  the $2.1  billion  cash  portion of the UDS  Acquisition  with
proceeds from a $1.5 billion bridge loan facility and  borrowings  under two new
$750 million revolving bank credit facilities.  Valero finalized both the bridge
loan facility and the two revolving bank credit  facilities  prior to completing
the acquisition, with borrowings under these facilities made on January 7, 2002.
As of December 31, 2001, the cash  consideration  was recorded as payable to UDS
shareholders in the consolidated balance sheet.

On December 31, 2001,  prior to the closing of the UDS  Acquisition,  UDS ceased
borrowing  under its commercial  paper program that had previously  been used to
fund  certain of its  ongoing  operations.  As a result,  Valero  borrowed  $703
million under its revolving bank credit  facilities and  uncommitted  short-term
bank lines and loaned  that  amount to UDS for its use in  repaying  all amounts
outstanding under the commercial paper program.  Since the transaction  occurred
prior to the closing of the UDS Acquisition,  the funds borrowed are included in
financing  activities  and the loan to UDS is  reflected  as  advance  to UDS in
connection with the UDS Acquisition in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Huntway Refining Company
Effective June 1, 2001,  Valero  completed the  acquisition of Huntway  Refining
Company,  a leading  supplier of asphalt in  California  (Huntway  Acquisition).
Huntway owned and operated two California  refineries at Benicia and Wilmington,
which primarily  process  California crude oil to produce liquid asphalt for use
in road  construction  and  repair  and  smaller  amounts  of gas oil,  naphtha,
kerosene, distillate and bunker fuels. The purchase price, net of Huntway's cash
balance on the date of acquisition,  was  approximately $76 million and included
payment to Huntway's common  stockholders of $1.90 per share, as well as amounts
required to retire Huntway's  outstanding  debt and satisfy payment  obligations
under outstanding stock options.

El Paso Refinery and Related Refined Product Logistics Business
Effective  June  1,  2001,   Valero   completed  the   acquisition  of  El  Paso
Corporation's  Corpus  Christi,  Texas  refinery  and  related  refined  product
logistics  business (El Paso  Acquisition).  As part of the acquisition,  Valero
also purchased  inventories for  approximately  $109 million and assumed certain
environmental liabilities, which were included in other long-term liabilities in
the consolidated  balance sheets.  The inventories were purchased with available
cash and the property,  plant and equipment,  net of assumed  liabilities,  were
acquired  through capital lease  obligations of approximately  $286 million.  On
February  28,  2003,  Valero  exercised  an option  under the capital  leases to
purchase the leased facilities (see Notes 7, 22 and 26).

Purchase Price Allocations for Acquisitions in 2001
The UDS, Huntway and El Paso  Acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase
method. The purchase price for each acquisition was initially allocated based on
the estimated  fair values of the  individual  assets  acquired and  liabilities
assumed  at  the  date  of  acquisition   based  on  each  asset's   anticipated
contribution to the enterprise, pending the completion of independent appraisals
and other  evaluations.  During the second quarter of 2002, final allocations of
the  purchase  price for the Huntway and El Paso  Acquisitions  were  completed.


                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


During the fourth  quarter of 2002,  the final  allocation of the purchase price
for the UDS Acquisition  was completed,  with the exception of the effect on the
purchase price  allocation of certain  pre-acquisition  tax matters as discussed
below.  The excess of the purchase  price over the fair values of the net assets
acquired in the UDS Acquisition was recorded as goodwill.

Certain  pre-acquisition  tax matters have not been finalized because additional
information is required. When these tax matters are resolved, the effect of such
matters will be recorded as purchase  accounting  adjustments.  One of these tax
matters relates to the measurement of a pre-acquisition contingency related to a
UDS  franchise  tax  matter  covering  1984  through  1997  which  has not  been
finalized,  due  principally  to a change in  outside  counsel  that was  beyond
Valero's  control.  Valero has  received an  assessment  of  approximately  $105
million  with  respect  to  this  matter,   including  interest  and  penalties.
Management  believes the purchase price  allocation  with respect to this matter
will be finalized during the first half of 2003.

The  final  purchase  price  allocations  for  the  Huntway,  El  Paso  and  UDS
Acquisitions are summarized below (in millions):



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


There  were  no  significant  adjustments  to  the  preliminary  purchase  price
allocations for the Huntway and El Paso Acquisitions.  Various  adjustments were
made to the  preliminary  purchase  price  allocation  for the UDS  Acquisition,
including:
     o    the  balance  of assets  held for sale was  adjusted  to  reflect  the
          difference   between  the  net  cash   received  by  Valero  from  the
          liquidation of Valero's investment in Diamond-Koch and the disposition
          of the Golden  Eagle  Business and the amount  originally  recorded as
          assets held for sale as of December 31, 2001 (see Note 6); and
     o    other  long-term  liabilities  were  increased to reflect  unfavorable
          lease obligations and additional accruals to conform the assessment of
          environmental  liabilities  resulting  from  the  UDS  Acquisition  to
          Valero's policy on accounting for environmental liabilities.

The operating  results of the Huntway and El Paso  Acquisitions were included in
the  consolidated  statements of income  beginning  June 1, 2001.  The operating
results of the UDS Acquisition  were included in the  consolidated  statement of
income beginning January 1, 2002.

Benicia Acquisition
During the second quarter of 2000,  Valero  completed the acquisition of certain
assets from  ExxonMobil  in the State of  California.  The  acquired  assets and
related  operations are referred to as the Benicia  Acquisition and included:

     o    the  165,000  barrel-per-day  Benicia  refinery  located  in  the  San
          Francisco Bay area and all tangible  assets used in the  operations of
          the refinery (Benicia Refinery);
     o    80  Exxon-branded   California   retail  service   stations   (Service
          Stations); and
     o    branded supplier  relationships  with over 260  Exxon-branded  service
          stations (Distribution Assets).

The  purchase  price  for  the  Benicia  Acquisition  was  $895  million,   plus
approximately $150 million for refinery  inventories acquired in the transaction
(based on market  prices at the time of closing) and certain  costs  incurred in
connection with the  acquisition.  The Benicia  Acquisition was funded through a
$400 million senior notes offering,  a $172.5 million offering of premium equity
participating  security  units (PEPS Units),  a common stock  offering  totaling
approximately  $174.2 million and borrowings under Valero's existing bank credit
facilities. See Notes 11, 13 and 14 for details regarding the senior notes, PEPS
Units and common stock offerings, respectively. In addition, Valero entered into
a $155 million  structured  lease  arrangement for the Service  Stations and the
Benicia Refinery's dock facility (see Note 22).

The  Service  Stations  included  10   company-operated   service  stations  and
approximately 70 dealer-operated  service stations subleased from Valero, all of
which have been  rebranded to the Valero brand.  In July 2000,  the dealers were
offered an option to purchase at fair value the service  stations that they were
leasing and enter into a new fuels purchase  agreement with Valero for a term of
15 years.  In connection  with this option,  these dealers  purchased 49 service
stations.  As a result,  the value  attributable  to the  Service  Stations  was
reduced by $72 million.

The changes in allowance  for doubtful  accounts  consisted of the following (in
millions):


In connection with the UDS Acquisition,  Valero assumed a $360 million revolving
accounts  receivable  sales  facility,  under which Valero  could sell  eligible
credit card and trade  accounts  receivable on an ongoing basis through a wholly
owned  subsidiary to a  third-party  financial  institution.  Valero also had an
existing  accounts  receivable  sales  facility  with  a  third-party  financial
institution  to sell on a revolving  basis up to $100 million of eligible  trade
accounts  receivable as of December 31, 2001, which was increased during 2002 to
$150 million.  On October 8, 2002,  Valero renewed and amended its agreement to,
among other things,  increase the size of its facility from $150 million to $250
million,  incorporate  credit card  receivables  into the program and extend the
maturity  date to October  2005.  The assumed UDS  facility  was  terminated  in
connection with the renewal and amendment of the Valero facility.

Under Valero's  existing  program,  a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero sells an
undivided  percentage  ownership interest in the eligible  receivables,  without
recourse, to a third-party financial institution. Valero remains responsible for
servicing the transferred  receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale
of  receivables  under the  program.  Under the  facility,  Valero  retains  the
residual interest in the designated pool of receivables. This retained interest,
which is included in receivables,  net in the  consolidated  balance sheets,  is
recorded at fair value.  Due to (i) a short  average  collection  cycle for such
receivables,   (ii)  Valero's  collection  experience  history,  and  (iii)  the


                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


composition of the designated pool of trade and credit card accounts  receivable
that are part of this  program,  the fair value of  Valero's  retained  interest
approximates  the total  amount of the  designated  pool of accounts  receivable
reduced by the amount of accounts  receivable sold to the third-party  financial
institution under the program.

The costs incurred by Valero related to these  programs,  which were included in
other income (expense),  net in the consolidated statements of income, were $6.8
million,  $2.3 million and $6.8  million for the years ended  December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Proceeds from  collections  under these revolving
accounts  receivable  sales  facilities of $8.5  billion,  $1.8 billion and $2.9
billion  were   reinvested  in  the  programs  by  the   third-party   financial
institutions for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
However, the third-party financial  institutions' interests in Valero's accounts
receivable  were never in excess of the sales facility  limits at any time under
these programs. No accounts receivable included in this program were written off
during 2002, 2001 or 2000.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  $1.1 billion and $420 million,  respectively,
of Valero's  accounts  receivable  comprised the  designated  pools of trade and
credit card accounts  receivable  included in these programs.  Of these amounts,
$250 million and $373 million was sold to the third-party financial institutions
and the  remaining  amount was  retained by Valero as of  December  31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

5. INVENTORIES

Inventories consisted of the following (in millions):

                                                      December 31,

                                                 ----             ----
  Refinery feedstocks....................    $   488.3         $   513.4
  Refined products and blendstocks.......        731.8             727.8
  Convenience store merchandise..........         87.1              87.9
  Materials and supplies.................        128.9             124.0
                                               -------           -------
     Inventories.........................    $ 1,436.1         $ 1,453.1
                                               =======           =======

Refinery feedstock and refined product and blendstock  inventory volumes totaled
54.8 million  barrels and 57.0 million barrels as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  The  reduction of  inventory  volumes  during 2002  resulted in a
liquidation of LIFO inventory  layers carried at lower costs which  prevailed in
prior  years.  The effect of the  liquidation  was to decrease  cost of sales by
approximately $39 million. There were no liquidations of LIFO inventories during
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.

As of December 31, 2002, the replacement cost of LIFO inventories exceeded their
LIFO carrying values by approximately $586 million.

In  determining  the carrying  value of Valero's  inventories as of December 31,
2001,  Valero  recognized  a net  reduction  in cost of  sales  of $8.8  million
resulting  from the effect of the valuation of  inventories  acquired in the UDS
Acquisition. This reduction in cost of sales was attributable to:
     o    a $101.4  million  reduction in cost of sales due to the  valuation of
          the  2001  LIFO  inventory  increment,  resulting  primarily  from the
          December 31, 2001 UDS Acquisition,  under Valero's pricing methodology




                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

          of average  purchase prices during the year (which were  significantly
          in excess of the December 31, 2001 prices at which the UDS inventories
          were acquired), and
     o    a  $92.6  million  increase  in  cost  of  sales  resulting  from  the
          write-down  of LIFO  inventories  to market  value as of December  31,
          2001.
As  a  result  of  the  inventory  write-down,  the  replacement  cost  of  LIFO
inventories approximated their carrying values as of December 31, 2001.

6. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

Golden Eagle Business
In  conjunction  with the UDS  Acquisition,  the FTC  approved a consent  decree
requiring the divestiture of certain UDS assets.  Similar decrees were finalized
with the states of Oregon and California.  Pursuant to the consent decrees,  the
assets to be  divested  were  required  to be held  separate  from other  Valero
operations,  with the  operations  of those  assets  overseen by an  independent
trustee approved by the FTC.

Those assets and their related  operations  were referred to as the Golden Eagle
Business and included:
     o    the 168,000  barrel-per-day  Golden Eagle Refinery  located in the San
          Francisco  Bay area and all tangible  assets used in the  operation of
          the refinery including docks, tanks and pipelines;
     o    the wholesale marketing business generally  associated with the Golden
          Eagle Refinery production, which included sales primarily to unbranded
          customers located in the northern half of California and Reno, Nevada;
          and
     o    70 Beacon- and Ultramar-branded convenience stores located in Northern
          California,  including land,  buildings,  pump equipment,  underground
          storage tanks and various store equipment.

Assets held for sale as of December 31, 2001 included the amount  expected to be
realized from the disposition of the Golden Eagle Business.  The amount recorded
was based on an agreement  for the sale of the Golden  Eagle  Business to Tesoro
Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro)  discussed below and expected cash flows
from  operations  of the Golden Eagle  Business from January 1, 2002 through the
anticipated date of sale. Pursuant to the sale agreement,  Valero agreed to sell
the Golden  Eagle  Business  to Tesoro for $1.075  billion,  which  included  an
estimated $130 million for refinery feedstock and refined product inventories.

On May 17, 2002,  the sale of the Golden Eagle  Business was  completed.  Valero
received  cash  proceeds of $925  million and two ten-year  junior  subordinated
notes with face amounts totaling $150 million as follows:
     o    a $100 million note, due July 17, 2012, which is non-interest  bearing
          for the first  five  years and  carries a 7.5%  interest  rate for the
          remaining five-year period, and
     o    a $50 million note, due July 17, 2012,  which bears no interest during
          the first year and bears interest at approximately  7.5% for years two
          through ten.
The two notes were  recorded with an initial fair value of $58.9 million using a
discount rate of 16%, which represented Valero's best estimate of the fair value
of the notes at the closing date of the sale.  The  discount is being  amortized
over the life of the notes and is reported as  interest  income in other  income
(expense), net in the consolidated statement of income. The notes receivable are
included in Valero's  consolidated  balance sheet in deferred  charges and other
assets.

The sales price  included the assumption by Tesoro of various  employee  benefit

accounts  payable,  certain  accrued  liabilities  and income  tax  obligations.
Results of operations  for the Golden Eagle  Business are excluded from Valero's
results of operations.  The  difference  between the net cash received by Valero
related to the Golden Eagle Business and the amount  recorded as assets held for
sale as of December 31, 2001 was accounted for by reallocating Valero's purchase
price for UDS.  No gain or loss was  recorded  by  Valero  on this  transaction.
Valero  applied the  consensus  reached in Emerging  Issues Task Force Issue No.
87-11 in  accounting  for  this  transaction  as the  disposal  activities  were
initiated prior to January 1, 2002.

Diamond-Koch
During  2001,  Koch  Industries,   Inc.  and  UDS,  both  50%  partners  in  the
Diamond-Koch,  L.P.  joint  venture,  decided  to sell the  operating  assets of
Diamond-Koch and began soliciting bids from interested parties.  Assets held for
sale as of December 31, 2001  included the amount  expected to be realized  from
the disposition of the operating assets of Diamond-Koch, L.P. During the quarter
ended March 31, 2002,  Diamond-Koch  completed the sales of its operating assets
for total proceeds of approximately $576 million.  All cash in the joint venture
in  excess  of  amounts  necessary  to wind  up its  business  was  distributed,
resulting in proceeds  received by Valero from the liquidation of its investment
of $300.9 million.  Proceeds received by Valero in excess of the amount recorded
as of December 31, 2001 were  accounted for by  reallocating  Valero's  purchase
price for UDS. No gain or loss was recorded by Valero on this transaction.

7. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Major classes of property,  plant and equipment,  which  includes  capital lease
assets, consisted of the following (in millions):



As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, Valero had crude oil processing facilities and
pipeline and terminal  facilities  under capital leases  totaling $308.2 million
and $318.7  million,  net of accumulated  amortization of $16.3 million and $6.0
million,  respectively.  On February 28, 2003, Valero exercised its option under
the capital leases to purchase the leased facilities as described in Note 26.

Depreciation  expense for the years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 was
$316.3 million, $137.7 million and $112.1 million, respectively.

8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consisted of the following (in millions):


The gross cost as of December 31, 2001 for the customer  lists,  Canadian retail
operations,  air  emission  credits,  and  $18.6  million  of  the  U.S.  retail
operations,  related  to  assets  acquired  on  December  31,  2001  in the  UDS
Acquisition;   therefore,   no  amortization  expense  was  incurred  for  these
intangible  assets  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2001.  All of  Valero's
intangible assets are subject to amortization.

In connection with the Benicia Acquisition, Valero received the exclusive rights
to offer the Exxon brand throughout the state of California  (except for the San
Francisco Bay area) for a ten-year period.  The value assigned to this right was
$35  million  and is  being  amortized  over  the  ten-year  term of the  rights
agreement.

Amortization  expense for  intangible  assets was $25.1 million and $6.0 million
for the years ended  December  31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The  estimated
aggregate  amortization  expense for the years ending  December 31, 2003 through
2007 is approximately $26 million per year.

9. GOODWILL

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows (in millions):


Because the goodwill  resulted  from the UDS  Acquisition  on December 31, 2001,
subsequent to the effective date of FASB Statement No. 142, no  amortization  of
goodwill is reflected in Valero's consolidated financial statements for any year
presented. All of the goodwill was allocated to the refining segment.



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Valero  completed  its annual  test for  impairment  of  goodwill  in the fourth
quarter of 2002.  Based on the results of the test,  there was no  impairment of
goodwill.

10. ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accrued expenses consisted of the following (in millions):

                                                             December 31,

The  decrease  in accrued  employee  benefit  costs is due mainly to lower bonus
accruals  as of December  31,  2002 as a result of the lower level of  operating
income recognized during 2002. The decrease in change-in-control  benefits was a
result of  benefits  paid in early 2002 to UDS  officers  and key  employees  in
connection  with the UDS  Acquisition.  Included in other  accrued  expenses are
amounts primarily related to various accruals for refining, retail and corporate
expenses.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


As of  December  31,  2002,  Valero  also had $3  million  outstanding  under an
uncommitted  short-term  bank credit facility with an interest rate of 2.75%. In
addition,  Valero had $147.1  million  of  letters of credit  outstanding  under
uncommitted short-term  facilities.  Valero's uncommitted credit facilities have
no  commitment  or other fees,  no  compensating  balance  requirements  and are
unsecured and unrestricted as to use.

On January 7, 2002,  Valero  financed  the $2.1  billion cash portion of the UDS
Acquisition,  which was recorded as payable to UDS  shareholders  as of December
31, 2001,  with proceeds from a $1.5 billion bridge loan facility and borrowings
under two new $750 million  revolving  bank credit  facilities.  The bridge loan
facility was a single-draw  facility with a one-year maturity.  Borrowings under
this  facility  were repaid in April 2002 with proceeds from a $1.8 billion debt
offering  discussed below. The two revolving bank credit facilities  provide for
commitments  of $750 million for a five-year term and $750 million for a 364-day
term,  respectively,  and, subject to the commitment amounts and terms,  provide
for borrowings to be made at various amounts,  maturities and interest rates, at
the option of Valero.

Valero will also be charged  various fees and expenses in connection  with these
facilities,  including  facility  fees and various  letter of credit  fees.  The
interest rates and fees under these  facilities are subject to adjustment  based
upon the credit ratings  assigned to Valero's  long-term debt.  These facilities
include  certain  restrictive  covenants,  including  a  coverage  ratio  and  a
debt-to-capitalization  ratio. As of December 31, 2002,  borrowings  under these
committed  facilities were $750 million while letters of credit outstanding were
approximately $99.8 million.

A Canadian  subsidiary of Valero has a committed revolving credit facility under
which it may borrow and obtain letters of credit up to Cdn. $115 million.  As of
December 31, 2002, Valero had Cdn. $6.4 million of letters of credit outstanding
under the Canadian revolving credit facility. Valero L.P. has a revolving credit
facility  under which it could borrow up to $120 million as of December 31, 2002
(subsequently  amended in March 2003 to increase the facility to $175  million).
As of December 31, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under the Valero L.P.
revolving credit facility.

On April 15,  2002,  Valero  issued $1.8 billion of notes under its $3.5 billion
shelf  registration  statement  as follows:
     o    $300 million of 6.125% notes due April 15, 2007,
     o    $750 million of 6.875% notes due April 15, 2012, and
     o    $750 million of 7.5% notes due April 15, 2032.
The notes are  unsecured  and are  redeemable,  in whole or in part, at Valero's
option.  Proceeds  from this offering  were used to repay all  borrowings  under
Valero's $1.5 billion bridge loan facility  associated  with the UDS Acquisition
and reduce borrowings under Valero's revolving bank credit facilities.

In June 2002,  Valero  L.P.  and Valero  Logistics  Operations,  L.P.,  indirect
subsidiaries of Valero as of December 31, 2002,  filed a $500 million  universal
shelf registration  statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In July 2002,  Valero Logistics  Operations,  L.P. issued $100 million of 6.875%
senior notes due 2012 under the registration statement.  The notes are unsecured
and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valero Logistics Operations,  L.P.'s
option.  The net  proceeds  from the offering  were used to repay $91.0  million
outstanding  under  the  Valero  Logistics  Operations,  L.P.  revolving  credit
facility and for general partnership purposes.

In July 2002,  $275 million of 8.625%  guaranteed  notes matured and were repaid
with borrowings under Valero's revolving bank credit facilities.

In September  2002,  Valero amended the interest  coverage ratio covenant in its
various bank credit facilities and structured lease arrangements.  The amendment
provides that Valero's  trailing  four-quarter  coverage  ratio must not be less
than:
     o    2.4 times for the  fourth  quarter  of 2002 and the first  quarter  of
          2003,
     o    2.5 times for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2003, and

at Valero's  option.  Almost all of these notes were issued in exchange  for the
$150 million of 6.75% notes issued to the Valero Pass-Through Asset Trust 1997-1
in 1997 and to  terminate  an option held by a third party to purchase the 6.75%
notes on December 15, 2002.

In connection with the UDS Acquisition,  Valero assumed various debt obligations
including 8.625% guaranteed notes, medium-term notes, debentures,  senior notes,
and various  notes  payable which were recorded at a fair value of $1.3 billion.

13. COMPANY-OBLIGATED PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS

Company-obligated preferred securities of subsidiary trusts include:
     o    $172.5  million of Premium Equity  Participating  Security Units (PEPS
          Units) which are mandatorily redeemable, and
     o    $200 million of Trust Originated  Preferred  Securities  (TOPrS) which
          are redeemable at Valero's option.

Premium Equity Participating Security Units
On June 28, 2000,  Valero issued $172.5 million of 7 3/4% PEPS Units in a public
offering  (6,900,000  units at $25.00 per unit).  The net  proceeds  received by
Valero from this offering, which were used to fund the Benicia Acquisition, were
approximately  $167 million.  Each PEPS Unit consists of a purchase contract for
shares of Valero common stock and a trust preferred security.

Each  purchase  contract  obligates the holder to purchase from Valero on August
18, 2003, for a price of $25.00 per contract,  the following number of shares of
Valero common stock based on the average  closing price of Valero's common stock



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


over the 20-day  trading  period ending on the third trading day prior to August
18, 2003:
     o    0.71531 shares if the average closing price equals or exceeds $34.95;
     o    a number of  shares  having a value  equal to  $25.00  if the  average
          closing price is less than $34.95 but greater than $29.125; and
     o    0.85837  shares if the average  closing price is less than or equal to
          $29.125.
The holder has the  option to settle a  purchase  contract  early for a price of
$25.00 in exchange for 0.71531 shares of Valero common stock.

Each trust preferred security  represents an undivided interest in the assets of
VEC Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary trust of Valero, has a stated liquidation
amount of $25.00 and matures on August 18, 2005. The trust preferred security is
pledged as collateral  to secure the PEPS Unit  holder's  obligation to purchase
Valero common stock under the related purchase contract. VEC Trust I pays a cash
distribution on each trust preferred security at the annual rate of 7.75% of the
$25.00 stated  liquidation  amount prior to August 18, 2003, and from August 18,
2003 until August 18, 2005,  at a reset rate that may be less than,  equal to or
greater than this amount.  The cash distribution  payments are made quarterly on
February 18, May 18, August 18 and November 18 of each year.

The  assets of VEC Trust I consist  solely  of Valero  senior  deferrable  notes
maturing  on  August  18,  2005.   VEC  Trust  I's  sole  source  of  funds  for
distributions  on the trust  preferred  securities  is the interest  payments it
receives  from Valero on the senior  deferrable  notes.  Valero has the right to
defer  interest on the senior  deferrable  notes until August 18, 2003, in which
case distributions on the trust preferred securities would also be deferred. Any
deferred  distributions  will  accumulate and compound  quarterly at the rate of
7.75% per year.  Valero  guarantees  the payment of  distributions  on the trust
preferred  securities  to the extent  interest is paid on the senior  deferrable
notes.  Distributions  on  the  trust  preferred  securities,  whether  paid  or
accumulated,   are  reflected  in  distributions  on  preferred   securities  of
subsidiary trust in the consolidated statements of income.

In August  2003,  pursuant to the  purchase  contract  that is part of each PEPS
Unit,  the holders of PEPS Units will be obligated to purchase  shares of common
stock  from  Valero for $25 per  purchase  contract,  which  will  result in the
receipt of $172.5  million of cash by Valero in  exchange  for the  issuance  of
common  stock at a price based on the 20-day  trading  period  described  above.
Holders of PEPS Units may settle  their  purchase  contracts  by paying  cash to
Valero or by remarketing their pledged trust preferred  securities and using the
proceeds from the remarketing to settle the purchase contracts. The distribution
rate on the trust preferred securities will be reset on August 18, 2003 based on
the price for which the trust preferred securities are remarketed.

Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero  common stock upon  settlement  of the
purchase contracts, the PEPS Units are reflected in Valero's earnings per common
share  -  assuming  dilution  calculations  using  the  treasury  stock  method.
Consequently,  the PEPS Units will have a dilutive  effect on earnings per share
for reporting  periods during which the average market price per share of Valero
common stock  exceeds  $34.95.  For reporting  periods  during which the average
market price per share of Valero common stock is $34.95 or less,  the PEPS Units
will have a dilutive  effect on earnings  per common  share - assuming  dilution
only when that average market price per share is above the average closing price
for the 20-day  trading  period ending on the third trading day prior to the end
of the reporting period.

Trust Originated Preferred Securities
On June 25, 1997,  UDS Capital I (the Trust)  issued $200 million of 8.32% Trust
Originated  Preferred  Securities  (TOPrS) in an  underwritten  public  offering
(8,000,000  units at $25.00 per unit).  The TOPrS became  redeemable on June 30,
2002 at the option of the Trust,  in whole or in part, at a redemption  price of
$25.00 per  security.  Distributions  on the TOPrS are  cumulative  and  payable
quarterly in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, if and
when the Trust has funds available for distribution, at the annual rate of 8.32%
of the liquidation amount of $25.00 per TOPrS.

As a result of the UDS  Acquisition,  the Trust is a wholly owned  subsidiary of

16. STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

In order to determine net cash provided by operating  activities,  net income is
adjusted  by,  among  other  things,  changes  in  current  assets  and  current
liabilities as follows (in millions):


These  changes in current  assets and current  liabilities  differ from  changes
between amounts reflected in the applicable  consolidated balance sheets for the
respective  periods for the following  reasons.  The amounts shown above exclude
changes in cash and temporary cash  investments,  assets held for sale,  current
deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities,  and  short-term  debt and current
portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations.  Also excluded from the
table  above  are  the  current  assets  and  current  liabilities  acquired  in
connection  with  the  UDS,  Huntway  and El Paso  Acquisitions  in 2001 and the
Benicia Acquisition in 2000, which are reflected  separately in the consolidated
statements of cash flow, and the effect of certain noncash investing  activities
discussed below. In addition,  certain differences between  consolidated balance
sheet  changes and  statement of cash flow changes  reflected  above result from
translating foreign currency denominated amounts at different exchange rates.

Noncash investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 included:
     o    the  adjustment  to  goodwill  and assets held for sale to reflect the
          difference  between  estimated  and actual  proceeds  received  on the
          liquidation of the investment in  Diamond-Koch  and the disposition of
          the Golden Eagle Business;
     o    the receipt of $150  million of notes from  Tesoro  with an  estimated
          fair value of $58.9 million in connection  with the disposition of the
          Golden Eagle Business; and
     o    various  adjustments to property,  plant and  equipment,  goodwill and
          certain current and other noncurrent assets and liabilities  resulting
          from  adjustments  to the purchase  price  allocations  related to the
          Huntway, El Paso and UDS Acquisitions.

Noncash investing and financing activities for 2001 included:
     o    the  issuance  of $2.1  billion  of common  stock and $120  million of
          vested  employee  stock options as partial  consideration  for the UDS
          Acquisition,
     o    the  recognition of capital lease  obligations of  approximately  $286
          million related to the El Paso Acquisition, and
     o    various  adjustments  to  property,  plant and  equipment  and certain
          current assets and current and noncurrent  liabilities  resulting from
          the  final   purchase   price   allocation   related  to  the  Benicia
          Acquisition.

Noncash investing and financing  activities for the year ended December 31, 2000
included  various  adjustments  to  property,  plant and  equipment  and certain
current assets and current liabilities  resulting from the preliminary  purchase
price allocation related to the Benicia Acquisition.

Cash flows related to interest and income taxes were as follows (in millions):


17. PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

Commodity Price Risk
Valero is exposed to market  risks  related to the  volatility  of crude oil and
refined product  prices,  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used
in its  refining  operations.  To reduce the  impact of this  price  volatility,
Valero uses derivative  commodity  instruments  (swaps,  futures and options) to
manage its exposure to:
     o    changes in the fair value of a portion of its refinery  feedstock  and
          refined  product  inventories and a portion of its  unrecognized  firm
          commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges);
     o    changes  in cash  flows of  certain  forecasted  transactions  such as
          forecasted  feedstock  purchases,  natural gas  purchases  and refined
          product sales (cash flow hedges); and
     o    price  volatility on a portion of its refined product  inventories and
          on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that are
          not  designated  as either  fair value or cash flow  hedges  (economic
          hedges).
In addition,  Valero uses derivative commodity  instruments for trading purposes
based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions.

Interest Rate Risk
Valero is  exposed  to market  risk for  changes in  interest  rates  related to
certain of its long-term  debt  obligations.  Interest rate swap  agreements are
used to  manage  a  portion  of the  exposure  to  changing  interest  rates  by
converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate debt.



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Foreign Currency Risk
Valero is exposed to exchange rate  fluctuations on transactions  related to its
Canadian operations. To manage its exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations,
Valero uses foreign currency  exchange and purchase  contracts.  These contracts
are not designated as hedging instruments.

During May 2002,  Valero  entered into foreign  currency  exchange  contracts to
hedge its  exposure  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on an  investment  in its
Canadian operations. Under these contracts, Valero sold $400 million of Canadian
dollars  and bought  $253.4  million of U.S.  dollars.  These  contracts  mature
annually at various  amounts  from 2003 through  2007.  As of December 31, 2002,
these contracts had a fair value of $6.1 million,  which are included in prepaid
expenses and other current  assets and deferred  charges and other  assets.  The
gain  recognized  in income on these  contracts,  which was $6.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002, was substantially offset by a loss of $2.4 million
recognized  in income from the effect of the exchange  rate  fluctuation  on the
hedged investment for the year.

As of December 31, 2002,  Valero had  commitments  to purchase  $33.8 million of
U.S.  dollars.  Valero's  market  risk was  minimal on these  contracts  as they
matured on or before January 3, 2003.

Impact of Adoption
The impact of  adopting  Statement  No. 133 as of January 1, 2001 was as follows
(debit (credit) in millions):

   Inventories...................................................     $  3.2
   Deferred charges, deferred credits and other..................       42.8
   Accounts payable..............................................       (2.5)
   Deferred income tax liabilities...............................      (15.2)
   Other comprehensive income, net of income tax expense.........      (28.3)

Current Period Disclosures
The net gain  (loss)  recognized  in  income  representing  the  amount of hedge
ineffectiveness was as follows (in millions):

                                                   Year Ended December 31,
                                                   -----------------------
                                                    2002              2001
                                                    ----              ----

   Fair value hedges...........................   $ (1.2)           $ (3.4)
   Cash flow hedges............................     29.3             (20.8)

The above amounts were included in cost of sales in the consolidated  statements
of income.  No  component  of the  derivative  instruments'  gains or losses was
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  No amounts were recognized
in income  for  hedged  firm  commitments  that no longer  qualify as fair value
hedges.

For cash flow hedges,  gains and losses currently  reported in accumulated other
comprehensive   income  (loss)  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  will  be
reclassified  into income when the forecasted  transactions  affect income.  The
estimated   amount  of  existing  net  gain   included  in   accumulated   other
comprehensive  income  (loss) as of  December  31,  2002 that is  expected to be
reclassified  into income within the next 12 months is less than $50,000.  As of
December 31, 2002, the maximum  length of time over which Valero was hedging its


                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions was
two years, with the majority of the transactions maturing in less than one year.
For the  years  ended  December  31,  2002  and  2001,  there  were  no  amounts
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a
result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting.

Market and Credit Risk
Valero's  price risk  management  activities  involve  the receipt or payment of
fixed price commitments into the future.  These transactions give rise to market
risk, the risk that future  changes in market  conditions may make an instrument
less valuable.  Valero closely  monitors and manages its exposure to market risk
on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by its Board of Directors.
Market risks are  monitored by a risk control  group to ensure  compliance  with
Valero's  stated risk  management  policy.  Concentrations  of  customers in the
refining  industry may impact Valero's  overall exposure to credit risk, in that
these  customers  may be  similarly  affected  by changes in  economic  or other
conditions.  Valero  believes  that its  counterparties  will be able to satisfy
their obligations under their price risk management contracts with Valero.

18. PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

Each outstanding  share of Valero's common stock is accompanied by one preferred
share purchase right (Right).  With certain exceptions,  each Right entitles the
registered  holder to  purchase  from  Valero  one  one-hundredth  of a share of
Valero's Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock, Series I at a price of $100 per
one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment for certain recapitalization
events.

The Rights are transferable only with the common stock until the earlier of:
          (i). 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of
               affiliated or associated  persons (Acquiring Person) has acquired
               beneficial  ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
               Valero's common stock,
          (ii).10 business  days (or later date as may be determined by Valero's
               Board of Directors) following the initiation of a tender offer or
               exchange  offer that would result in an Acquiring  Person  having
               beneficial  ownership  of 15% or  more  of  Valero's  outstanding
               common stock (the earlier of the date of the occurrence of (i) or
               (ii) being called the Rights Separation Date), or
          (iii). the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights.

The Rights are not  exercisable  until the Rights  Separation  Date. At any time
prior to the acquisition by an Acquiring  Person of beneficial  ownership of 15%
or more of Valero's  outstanding  common stock,  Valero's Board of Directors may
redeem the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right.  The Rights will expire on June
30,  2007,  unless  extended or the Rights are earlier  redeemed or exchanged by
Valero.

If after the Rights  Separation  Date,  Valero is  acquired in a merger or other
business combination  transaction,  or if 50% or more of its consolidated assets
or earning power is sold, each holder of a Right will have the right to receive,
upon the exercise of the Right at its then current  exercise price,  that number
of shares  of common  stock of the  acquiring  company  which at the time of the
transaction  will have a market  value of two times  the  exercise  price of the
Right.  In the event that any Acquiring  Person becomes the beneficial  owner of
15% or more of Valero's  outstanding common stock, each holder of a Right, other
than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be
void),  will  thereafter  have the right to receive upon exercise that number of
shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise  price of
the Right.

                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


At any time after an Acquiring  Person acquires  beneficial  ownership of 15% or
more of Valero's  outstanding  common stock and prior to the  acquisition by the
Acquiring Person of 50% or more of Valero's  outstanding common stock,  Valero's
Board of  Directors  may  exchange  the Right  (other than  Rights  owned by the
Acquiring  Person which have become void),  at an exchange ratio of one share of
common stock, or one  one-hundredth  of a share of Junior  Preferred  Stock, per
Right (subject to adjustment).

Until a Right is exercised,  the holder will have no rights as a stockholder  of
Valero including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
The  Rights  may have  certain  anti-takeover  effects.  The  Rights  will cause
substantial  dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire Valero on
terms not approved by Valero's Board of Directors,  except  pursuant to an offer
conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired.  The Rights should
not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by Valero's
Board of Directors  since the Rights may be redeemed by Valero prior to the time
that an  Acquiring  Person has acquired  beneficial  ownership of 15% or more of
Valero's outstanding common stock.

As of December 31, 2002,  Valero had the following U.S. federal and state income
tax credit and loss carryforwards (in millions):


Approximately  $17  million of the AMT  credit,  $1 million of the U.S.  federal
income tax credits,  and $20 million of the U.S. federal NOL  carryforwards  are
subject to annual U.S. federal income tax limitations.

Valero has recorded a valuation  allowance as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, due
to  uncertainties  related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income
tax assets,  primarily  consisting of certain state net operating  losses carred
forward and  foreign  tax credits  carried  forward,  before  they  expire.  The
valuation  allowance  is based on Valero's  estimates  of taxable  income in the
various  jurisdictions  in which it operates and the period over which  deferred
income tax assets will be  recoverable.  The  realization of net deferred income
tax assets  recorded as of December 31, 2002 is dependent upon Valero's  ability
to  generate  future  taxable  income  in both the  U.S.  and  Canada.  Although
realization is not assured,  Valero believes it is more likely than not that the
net deferred income tax assets will be realized.

U.S. federal deferred income taxes or Canadian  withholding  taxes have not been
provided for on the  undistributed  earnings of Valero's  Canadian  subsidiaries
based on the determination that those earnings will be indefinitely  reinvested.
As of  December  31,  2002,  the  cumulative  undistributed  earnings  of  these
subsidiaries  were  approximately  $80  million.  If  those  earnings  were  not
considered  indefinitely  reinvested,  U.S.  federal  deferred  income taxes and
Canadian  withholding  taxes would have been  recorded  after  consideration  of
foreign tax credits.

Valero's  separate tax years  through 1998 and UDS's tax years  through 1994 and
for 1998 are  closed  to  adjustment  by the  Internal  Revenue  Service.  UDS's
separate tax years 1995 through 1997 are  currently  under  examination.  Valero
believes that adequate  provisions  for income taxes have been  reflected in the
consolidated financial statements.

20. SEGMENT INFORMATION

Prior to the UDS Acquisition,  Valero had one reportable  segment,  the refining
and marketing of refined  products.  Beginning  January 1, 2002,  Valero has two
reportable segments, refining and retail, because of Valero's acquisition of UDS
on December 31, 2001, and its significant retail  operations.  Valero's refining
segment includes refining operations,  wholesale  marketing,  product supply and
distribution,   and  transportation  operations.  The  retail  segment  includes
company-operated  convenience  stores,  Canadian  dealers/jobbers  and truckstop
facilities, cardlock facilities and home heating oil operations. Operations that
are not  included in either of the two  reportable  segments are included in the
corporate  category.  Segment  information for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000  have been  reclassified  to  conform  to the 2002  reportable  segment
presentation.

The  reportable  segments  are  strategic  business  units that offer  different
products and services.  They are managed  separately  as each business  requires
unique  technology and marketing  strategies.  Performance is evaluated based on
operating  income.  Intersegment  sales are generally  derived from transactions
made at prevailing market rates.

21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
Valero  has  several  qualified  non-contributory  defined  benefit  plans  (the
Qualified Plans)  including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition,  some of which
were subject to collective  bargaining  agreements.  The  Qualified  Plans cover
substantially  all employees in the United States and generally provide eligible
employees  with  retirement  income  based on years of service and  compensation
during specific periods. Effective March 1 and April 1, 2002, certain classes of
former UDS retail  employees ceased accruing  benefits under Valero's  qualified
pension plan.

Valero also has various  nonqualified  supplemental  executive  retirement plans
(Supplemental  Plans),  including  those assumed in the UDS  Acquisition,  which
provide  additional  pension  benefits to executive  officers and certain  other
employees.  The  Supplemental  Plans and the  Qualified  Plans are  collectively
referred to as the Pension Plans.

Approximately  $32 million and $19 million of the  Qualified  Plans' assets were
invested in Valero common stock as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.
The  balance  of the assets are  invested  in  domestic  and  foreign  equities,
corporate bonds, government securities and money market funds.

In connection with the UDS Acquisition,  Valero approved the  establishment of a
supplement  to the pension plan (the 2001  Voluntary  Early  Retirement  Window)
which permitted  certain  employees to retire from employment during 2002. There
were 100  employees  who accepted the 2001  Voluntary  Early  Retirement  Window
option.

Valero also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees,   referred  to  as  postretirement   benefits  other  than  pensions.
Substantially  all of Valero's  employees may become eligible for these benefits
if, while still working for Valero,  they either reach normal  retirement age or
take early retirement. Valero offers health care benefits through a self-insured
plan and a health  maintenance  organization  while life insurance  benefits are
provided through an insurance company.  Valero funds its postretirement benefits
other than  pensions on a  pay-as-you-go  basis.  Individuals  who became Valero
employees  as a result of an  acquisition  by Valero  became  eligible for other
postretirement  benefits  under  Valero's  plan as  determined  by  terms of the
acquisition agreement.

Amortization  of prior  service cost as shown in the above table is based on the
average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under
the plan.  The  weighted-average  assumptions  used in computing  the  actuarial
present  value  of  the  pension  benefit  and  other   postretirement   benefit
obligations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:


For the  December  31,  2002  measurement,  the health  care cost trend rate was
assumed to be 10% in 2002 and 2003,  then  decrease  1% per year to an  ultimate
rate of 5.25% in 2008 and beyond.  For the  December 31, 2001  measurement,  the
health  care cost trend rate was  assumed to  decrease 1% per year from the 2001
rate of 10% to an ultimate rate of 5.5% in 2006 and beyond.  Assumed health care
cost trend rates have a  significant  effect on the amounts  reported for health
care  plans.  A one  percentage-point  change in assumed  health care cost trend
rates would have the  following  effects on other  postretirement  benefits  (in
millions):



Profit-Sharing/Savings Plans
Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan
Valero is the sponsor of the Valero Energy  Corporation  Thrift Plan, which is a
qualified  employee  profit-sharing  plan.  Participation  in the Thrift Plan is
voluntary  and is open to Valero  employees who become  eligible to  participate
upon the completion of one month of continuous service. This service may include
prior employment with other companies acquired by Valero.

Through December 31, 2001,  participants could make basic  contributions from 2%
up to 8% of their total annual compensation. In addition,  participants who made
a basic contribution of 8% could also make a supplemental  contribution of up to
14% of their total annual compensation.  Valero made an employer contribution to
the Thrift Plan equal to 75% of the participant's  basic  contributions up to 8%
of the base  annual  compensation.  The Thrift  Plan  provided  that if Valero's
return  on  equity  for a given  year was equal to or  greater  than  10%,  then
Valero's employer  contribution would be equal to 100% of a participant's  basic
contributions  relating to the participant's base annual salary for the 12-month
period  beginning  February 1 for the calendar year  following the year in which
the 10% return was achieved.  In January  2001,  the  compensation  committee of
Valero's  Board  of  Directors   approved  an  increase  in  Valero's   employer
contribution  from 75% to 100% for the  12-month  period  beginning  February 1,
2001.

Effective  January  1,  2002,  the  Thrift  Plan was  amended  to  provide  that
participants  would be able to make a supplemental  contribution of up to 22% of
their total annual  compensation and the maximum match by Valero would be 75% of



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


each participant's basic contributions up to 8% based on the participant's total
annual  compensation,  including  overtime and cash bonuses.  However,  employer
contributions  were  equal to 100% of  employee  contributions  up to 8% between
January 1 and February 1, 2002.

Valero's contributions to the Thrift Plan for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 were $20.9 million, $13.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively.

Valero Savings Plan
In connection  with the UDS  Acquisition,  Valero became the plan sponsor of the
Valero  Savings Plan  (formerly the UDS 401(k)  Retirement  Savings  Plan).  The
Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that previously covered all eligible
employees of UDS. Under the Savings Plan, participants can contribute from 1% to
15% of their  compensation.  Effective  January 1, 2002,  the  company  matching
contributions for certain non-store employees of UDS was changed to 75% of up to
8% of  employee  contributions.  Effective  April  1,  2002,  certain  non-store
employees of UDS were no longer eligible to participate in the Savings Plan, but
became eligible to participate in the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan.

Valero's  contribution  to the Savings Plan for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $3.7 million.  There were no contributions to the Savings Plan for the years
ended  December  31,  2001 and 2000 as Valero  was not a sponsor of the plan for
those years.

Stock Compensation Plans
Valero has various fixed and  performance-based  stock compensation plans, which
are summarized as follows:
     o    The Executive  Stock  Incentive  Plan (ESIP)  authorizes  the grant of
          various stock and stock-related awards to executive officers and other
          key  employees.  Awards  available  under the ESIP include  options to
          purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the
          achievement of an objective  performance  goal,  and restricted  stock
          which  vests  over  a  period  determined  by  Valero's   compensation
          committee.  As of December 31,  2002,  a total of 1,968,267  shares of
          Valero common stock remain available to be awarded under the ESIP.
     o    A non-qualified stock option plan grants options to purchase shares of
          common stock to key officers,  employees and prospective employees. As
          of December 31, 2002, a total of 163,459 shares of Valero common stock
          remain available to be awarded under this plan.
     o    The Executive  Incentive Bonus Plan provides bonus compensation to key
          employees based on individual  contributions to company profitability.
          Bonuses are payable either in cash,  Valero common stock,  or both. As
          of December 31, 2002, a total of 200,000 shares of Valero common stock
          remain authorized to be issued under this plan.
     o    A  non-employee  director  stock  option  plan  provides  non-employee
          directors  of  Valero  automatic  annual  grants of stock  options  to
          purchase  Valero's  common stock.  As of December 31, 2002, a total of
          116,000  shares of Valero common stock remain  available to be awarded
          under this plan.
     o    A  restricted   stock  plan  for   non-employee   directors   provides
          non-employee  directors a grant of  Valero's  common  stock  valued at
          $45,000  that vests in three equal annual  installments,  with similar
          grants issued after full vesting of prior  grants.  As of December 31,
          2002, a total of 75,942 shares of Valero common stock remain available
          to be awarded under this plan.
     o    Valero GP, LLC's 2000  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan and 2002 Unit Option
          Plan provide for grants of restricted  common units of Valero L.P. and
          options  to  purchase  common  units  of  Valero  L.P.,  respectively.
          Generally,  these  restricted  common  unit and option  awards vest in
          three equal annual  installments.  As of December 31, 2002, a total of



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


          194,750  units and 23,800  units of Valero L.P.  common  units  remain
          available to be awarded under the 2000  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan and
          2002 Unit Option Plan, respectively.

The number and weighted-average grant-date fair value of shares of Valero common
stock granted under the  above-noted  plans (other than shares  related to stock
options  which are  presented in a separate  table below) during the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows:


Under the terms of the ESIP, the stock option plan and the non-employee director
stock option plan, the exercise  price of options  granted will not be less than
the fair  market  value of  Valero's  common  stock at the date of grant.  Stock
options become exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements between
Valero  and  the  participants,  usually  in  three  equal  annual  installments
beginning one year after the date of grant,  with unexercised  options generally
expiring  ten  years  from  the  date  of  grant.  Upon  completion  of the  UDS
Acquisition,  all UDS stock options held by employees and non-employee directors
of UDS became  vested and were  converted to Valero stock  options,  which had a
fair value of $120 million.

22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases
Valero has long-term  operating lease commitments for land,  office  facilities,
retail  facilities  and  related  equipment,   transportation   equipment,  dock
facilities   and  various   facilities   and  equipment  used  in  the  storage,
transportation, production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products.
In connection with the UDS Acquisition,  Valero assumed various operating leases
for convenience stores,  transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going
tankers and  coastal  vessels,  office  facilities  and other  assets with terms
expiring at various dates through 2053.

Certain  leases for  production  equipment  and  feedstock  and refined  product
storage facilities provide for various contingent payments based on, among other
things,  throughput  volumes  in excess of a base  amount.  Certain  leases  for
vessels contain renewal options and escalation  clauses,  which vary by charter,
and  provisions for the payment of chartering  fees,  which either vary based on
usage or provide for payments,  in addition to  established  minimums,  that are
contingent on usage.  Leases for convenience  stores may also include provisions
for contingent  rental  payments based on sales volumes.  In most cases,  Valero
expects  that in the normal  course of  business,  its leases will be renewed or
replaced by other leases.

The El Paso Acquisition was acquired,  in part, through capital lease agreements
entered into with certain wholly owned  subsidiaries  of El Paso. As of December
31, 2002, Valero had not yet exercised its option to purchase the assets subject
to the capital  leases.  Accordingly,  the table below  reflects a capital lease
obligation to El Paso. The lease agreements required Valero to make annual lease
payments of $18.5 million for each of the first two years. On February 28, 2003,
Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased facilities for $289.3 million
as further described in Note 26.

Valero's future minimum rental payments and minimum rentals to be received under
subleases for operating leases having initial or remaining  noncancelable  lease
terms in excess of one year and for the  capital  leases  related to the El Paso
Acquisition, as of December 31, 2002, were as follows (in millions):

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Included in the table above are long-term  operating lease commitments that have
been  funded  through  structured  lease   arrangements  with   non-consolidated
third-party  entities.   These  leases  are  for  land,  office  facilities  and
equipment,  retail  facilities and equipment,  dock  facilities,  transportation
equipment,  and various  facilities  and  equipment  used in the  production  of
refined  products.  The  non-consolidated  third-party  entities  constructed or
purchased the related assets and then leased them to Valero.  The assets held by
these third-party  entities were funded through borrowings by these entities and
equity contributions equal to at least 3% of the asset cost. Neither Valero, its
affiliates nor any related parties hold any interest in these entities. For each
lease,  Valero has the option to purchase  the leased  assets at any time during
the lease term for a price that approximates fair value. After the initial lease
term,  the leases may be extended by agreement  of the  parties.  Alternatively,
Valero may  arrange for the sale of the leased  properties  to one or more third
parties, in which case the leases provide for a maximum residual value guarantee
ranging from 82% to 87% of the appraised  value of the leased  properties at the
end of the lease  term,  as  determined  at the  inception  of the lease.  As of
December 31, 2002, the total amount drawn on these structured lease arrangements
was approximately $642 million.

In addition to the above-noted  structured lease  arrangements,  in August 2001,
Valero  entered into a $300 million  structured  lease  arrangement  to fund the
construction  of a new 45,000  barrel-per-day  coker  facility at its Texas City
Refinery. This structured lease has a lease term that expires in August 2006 and
will be accounted for as an operating  lease upon  completion of construction of
the coker facility.  Valero has an option to purchase the leased property at any
time during the lease term for a price that approximates  fair value.  After the
initial lease term, Valero may renew the lease for up to two additional one-year
periods followed by one additional  nine-month  period,  subject to the lessor's
approval,  or Valero may arrange for the sale of the leased  property to a third
party,  in which case the lease provides for a maximum  residual value guarantee
equal to approximately 82% of the property's  construction cost. The sale option
can also be exercised  at the end of any renewal  period.  If Valero  elects the
sale option, the lessor has the right to require Valero to extend the lease term
for up to one  additional  year,  in  which  case  the  maximum  residual  value
guarantee percentages will be reduced.

In  February  2002,  Valero  entered  into  a  $170  million   structured  lease
arrangement to combine a portion of an existing  structured lease assumed in the
UDS  Acquisition  related to the UDS  headquarters  facility with the funding of
planned  construction  to expand this  facility  for future use as Valero's  new
corporate  headquarters.  The  portion  of the new  arrangement  related  to the
existing UDS facility is being  accounted for as an operating lease beginning in
February  2002,  while the  portion  related  to  planned  construction  will be
accounted for as an operating  lease upon completion of the  construction.  This
structured lease has a lease term that expires in February 2007 and provides for
up to two one-year  renewal periods  exercisable at Valero's  option.  If Valero
elects to renew the lease,  Valero is required to provide cash  collateral in an
amount equal to the residual value guarantee, which is currently estimated to be
approximately $146 million.

agreements.  Valero enters into these  contracts to ensure an adequate supply of
utilities,  feedstock  and storage to operate its  refineries.  Many of Valero's
purchase  obligations are based on market prices or adjustments  based on market
indices.  Certain of these purchase  obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements,  while  others  are  based on  Valero's  usage  requirements.  The
purchase  obligations  reflected  below include  agreements  that have remaining
noncancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002, and are based
on expected  quantities to be purchased and/or estimated prices to be paid based
on current market  conditions.  These purchase  obligations are not reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated future annual purchase obligations as
of December 31, 2002 were as follows (in millions):

Guarantees
In  connection  with the sale of the Golden Eagle  Business,  Valero  guaranteed
certain lease payment  obligations  related to an MTBE facility lease assumed by
Tesoro, which totaled approximately $46 million as of December 31, 2002.

Valero's  structured  lease  arrangements  provide  for maximum  residual  value
guarantees  ranging  from  82%  to  87% of the  appraised  value  of the  leased
properties  at the end of the lease term,  as determined at the inception of the
lease. As of December 31, 2002, the maximum residual value guarantee on Valero's
structured lease arrangements was approximately $541 million.

Contingent Earn-Out Agreements
In connection with Valero's  acquisitions of the Paulsboro  Refinery in 1998 and
Basis  Petroleum,  Inc. in 1997, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in
any of the five years and ten years, respectively,  following these acquisitions
if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified
level.


                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Payments  due  under  the  earn-out  arrangement  for  the  Paulsboro  Refinery,
determined  in September of each year,  are limited to $20 million  annually and
$50 million in the aggregate.  No earn-out payments were due for the years ended
September  16, 2002 and 2000,  and an earn-out  amount of $20.0 million was paid
for the year ended September 16, 2001.

Payments  due under  the  earn-out  arrangement  for the  acquisition  of Basis,
determined  as of May 1 of each year,  are limited to $35 million  annually  and
$200 million in the aggregate.  No earn-out  amounts were due for the year ended
May 1, 2000, and earn-out payments for the years ended May 1, 2002 and 2001 were
$23.9  million and $35.0  million,  respectively.  Aggregate  earn-out  payments
through December 31, 2002 totaled $69.2 million.

Valero accounts for any payments under these  arrangements as an additional cost
of the  respective  acquisition,  of which $59.3 million has been  attributed to
property,  plant and equipment and is being depreciated over the remaining lives
of the assets to which the  additional  cost is allocated  and $29.9 million has
been attributed to goodwill and is not being amortized.

23. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Liabilities  for  future  remediation  costs  are  recorded  when  environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated.  Other  than for  assessments,  the  timing  and  magnitude  of these
accruals  are  generally  based on the  completion  of  investigations  or other
studies or a commitment  to a formal plan of action.  Environmental  liabilities
are  based  on best  estimates  of  probable  undiscounted  future  costs  using
currently  available  technology and applying  current  regulations,  as well as
Valero's own internal environmental policies.

The balance of and changes in the accruals for environmental  matters, which are
principally included in other long-term  liabilities  described in Note 12, were
as follows (in millions):


In  connection   with  its  various   acquisitions,   Valero   assumed   several
environmental  liabilities  including,  but not limited to, certain  remediation
obligations, site restoration costs and certain liabilities relating to soil and
groundwater contamination.

In 2000, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) issued to a majority of
refiners  operating  in the  United  States a  series  of  information  requests
pursuant  to  Section  114 of  the  Clean  Air  Act as  part  of an  enforcement
initiative.  Valero received a Section 114 information request pertaining to all
of its refineries  owned at that time.  Valero has completed its response to the
request.  Several other refiners have reached settlements with the EPA regarding
this enforcement initiative. Though Valero has not been named in any proceeding,



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


it also has been discussing the possibility of settlement with the EPA regarding
this initiative.  Based in part upon announced settlements and evaluation of its
relative  position,  Valero expects to incur  penalties and related  expenses in
connection with a potential  settlement of this enforcement  initiative.  Valero
believes  that any  potential  settlement  penalties  will be  immaterial to its
financial position.  However, Valero believes that any potential settlement with
the EPA in this matter will require various  capital  improvements or changes in
operating  parameters,  or both, at some or all of its refineries which could be
material in the aggregate.

Valero believes that it has adequately provided for its environmental  exposures
with the accruals referred to above.  These liabilities have not been reduced by
potential future  recoveries from third parties.  Environmental  liabilities are
difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors such as the magnitude of
possible contamination,  the timing and extent of remediation, the determination
of Valero's  liability in proportion to other parties,  improvements  in cleanup
technologies,  and the extent to which  environmental  laws and  regulations may
change in the future.

24. LITIGATION MATTERS

Unocal
In 2002,  Union Oil Company of California  (Unocal) sued Valero  alleging patent
infringement.  The  complaint  seeks  a 5.75  cent  per  gallon  royalty  on all
reformulated  gasoline  infringing  on  Unocal's  '393 and '126  patents.  These
patents cover certain  compositions of cleaner-burning  gasoline.  The complaint
seeks  treble  damages for Valero's  alleged  willful  infringement  of Unocal's
patents and Valero's  alleged  conduct to induce others to infringe the patents.
In a previous lawsuit  involving its '393 patent,  Unocal prevailed against five
other major refiners.  In 2001, the Federal Trade  Commission began an antitrust
investigation  concerning  Unocal's conduct with a joint industry research group
during the time that Unocal was  prosecuting  its patents at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (PTO). On March 4, 2003, the FTC announced that it was filing a
complaint against Unocal for antitrust violations.  The FTC's complaint seeks an
injunction against any future patent enforcement activity by Unocal. Each of the
'393 and '126 patents is being reexamined by the PTO. The PTO has issued notices
of  rejection  of all  claims of each of these  patents.  These  rejections  are
subject to additional  proceedings,  including  administrative appeal by Unocal,
followed  by an  appeal  in  federal  district  court or the  court of  appeals.
Ultimate  invalidation  would preclude  Unocal from pursuing claims based on the
'393 or '126 patents.  Unocal's  patent lawsuit  against Valero is  indefinitely
stayed as a result of the PTO  reexamination  proceedings.  Notwithstanding  the
judgment against the other refiners in the previous litigation,  Valero believes
that it has several strong defenses to Unocal's lawsuit, including those arising
from Unocal's  misconduct,  and Valero  believes it will prevail in the lawsuit.
However,  due  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  litigation,  there  can be no
assurance that Valero will prevail,  and an adverse result could have a material
adverse effect on Valero's results of operations and financial position.

MTBE Litigation
Valero  is  a  defendant  in  various  cases  alleging  MTBE   contamination  in
groundwater in New York and  California.  The plaintiffs  generally  allege that
refiners  and   manufacturers  of  gasoline   containing  MTBE  are  liable  for
manufacturing a defective product.  In California,  the lawsuits have been filed
by local water providers, including the City of Santa Monica, the City of Dinuba
and Fruitridge Vista Water Company. In New York, a lawsuit has been filed by the
Suffolk  County Water  Authority.  These cases are primarily  based on a product
liability/product defect theory and seek individual,  unquantified  compensatory
and punitive  damages and attorneys'  fees.  Valero believes it is unlikely that



                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


the final outcome of any one of these suits filed by local water providers would
have a  material  adverse  effect on its  results  of  operations  or  financial
position,  but that an adverse  result in a majority of these cases could have a
material  adverse  effect  on  Valero's  results  of  operations  and  financial
position.

Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary  course of  business.  Valero  believes it is  unlikely  that the final
outcome of any of the claims or  proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material  adverse  effect on its  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity;  however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the range of
possible loss, if any, cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision
and there can be no assurance  that the  resolution of any  particular  claim or
proceeding  would not have an adverse effect on Valero's  results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

25. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)

Valero's  results of operations by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001 were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):





- --------------------------------------------------------------
(a)  Includes the operations of UDS beginning January 1, 2002.
(b)  Includes the operations of the Huntway and El Paso  Acquisitions  beginning
     June 1, 2001 but excludes the  operations of UDS since the UDS  Acquisition
     was completed on December 31, 2001.




26.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Cash Dividends and Distributions
On January 23, 2003,  Valero's Board of Directors  declared a regular  quarterly
cash  dividend of $0.10 per common  share  payable  March 12, 2003 to holders of
record at the close of business on February 12, 2003.

On January 24, 2003, Valero L.P. declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.70
per unit  payable on February 14, 2003 to  unitholders  of record on February 5,
2003. The total  distribution is expected to be  approximately  $14.1 million of
which approximately $3.6 million is payable to minority unitholders.

Exercise of El Paso Acquisition Purchase Option
On February 28, 2003,  Valero exercised its option to purchase the East Plant of
the Corpus Christi Refinery and related refined product logistics business under
its capital leases with El Paso  Corporation.  In connection  with the exercise,
the  original  purchase  price for the assets was  reduced by  approximately  $5
million to $289.3 million and the lease payment of  approximately $5 million due
in the first quarter of 2003 was avoided.

Issuance of Valero L.P. Common Units and Private Placement of Debt
Effective  March 18,  2003,  Valero L.P.  issued  5,750,000  common units to the
public for  aggregate  proceeds of  approximately  $211 million and  completed a
private  placement  of $250  million  of  debt.  The  net  proceeds  from  those
offerings,  combined with borrowings under Valero L.P.'s credit  facility,  were
used to fund a  redemption  of common units from Valero and the  acquisition  of
certain storage tanks and a pipeline system from Valero discussed further below.

Redemption  of  Valero  L.P.   Common  Units  and  Amendment  of  Valero  L.P.'s
Partnership Agreement
Subsequent  to the equity and debt  offerings  by Valero L.P.  discussed  above,
Valero  L.P.  redeemed  approximately  3.8  million  of its  common  units  from
subsidiaries of Valero,  effectively  reducing Valero's ownership of Valero L.P.
from  approximately 73 percent to  approximately  49 percent.  At the same time,
Valero L.P.  also  amended its  partnership  agreement to state that the general
partner of Valero L.P.  may be removed by the vote of the holders of at least 58
percent of Valero L.P.'s common and subordinated units, excluding the units held
by affiliates of its general partner.  As a result of the partnership  agreement
changes and the issuance and redemption of Valero L.P. common units, Valero will
cease consolidation of Valero L.P.

Contribution of Storage Tanks and South Texas Pipeline System
Subsequent to the equity and debt  offerings  and the common unit  redemption by
Valero L.P. discussed above,  Valero contributed to Valero L.P. 58 crude oil and
intermediate  feedstock storage tanks located at Valero's Corpus Christi,  Texas
City and Benicia  Refineries for approximately $200 million in cash. The storage
tanks have a capacity of about 11 million  barrels.  Valero also  contributed to
Valero L.P. a refined products pipeline system for approximately $150 million in
cash.  The  three-pipeline  system  connects  Valero's  Corpus Christi and Three
Rivers  Refineries  to markets in Houston,  San Antonio and the Texas Rio Grande
Valley. In connection with the contribution of these assets, Valero entered into
certain  throughput,  handling,  terminalling and service agreements with Valero
L.P.

27. RECLASSIFICATIONS TO 2001 AND 2000 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Certain amounts in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated  financial statements,  as set
forth in the table below,  were reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation
(in millions):


The balance sheet reclassifications principally reflect the conforming of Valero
and UDS account classifications, which resulted in no change to working capital.
In  addition,  revisions  have  been  made to the  2001  and  2000  consolidated
statements  of cash flows and the 2001 amounts  included in Notes 4, 7, 8 and 10
to conform to these reclassifications (in millions).

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


The  income  statement   reclassifications   principally  reflect  the  separate
presentation  of  amounts  previously  included  in cost of sales and  operating
expenses.  Refining  operating  expenses and retail  selling  expenses have been
separately  presented,  consistent with Valero's 2002 segment  disclosures,  and
amortization expense has been combined with depreciation expense.





ITEM 9. CHANGES  IN  AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
        FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

There have not been any changes in or  disagreements  with Valero's  independent
accountants  since the date of Valero's  dismissal  of Arthur  Andersen  LLP and
appointment  of Ernst & Young LLP as Valero's  independent  auditor on March 12,
2002.  That change was  reported by Valero in a Current  Report  dated March 12,
2002,  and filed  with the SEC on March 14, 2002  (Form  8-K) and April 3, 2002
(Form 8-K/A).  Because the change in accountants was  "previously  reported" (as
that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) on
Form 8-K, the matter is not further  disclosed in this report (per Instruction 1
to Item 304 of Regulation S-K).


                                    PART III

ITEMS 10-13. DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Certain  information about directors and executive officers required by Items 10
through  13 of  Form  10-K is  incorporated  herein  by  reference  to  Valero's
definitive  Proxy  Statement for the 2003 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders  which
Valero will file with the Commission before April 30, 2003. Certain  information
required by Item 401 of Regulation S-K concerning  Valero's  executive  officers
appears in Part I of this report.


ITEM 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

         (a)  Evaluation  of  disclosure   controls  and  procedures.   Valero's
principal  executive  officer and  principal  financial  officer have  evaluated
Valero's  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-14(c) under
the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934) as of a date within 90 days of the filing
date of this  Annual  Report  on Form  10-K.  Based  on that  evaluation,  these
officers concluded that the design and operation of Valero's disclosure controls
and  procedures  are  effective  in  ensuring  that  information  required to be
disclosed by Valero in the reports  that it files or submits  under the Exchange
Act is recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

         (b)  Changes  in  internal  controls.  There  have been no  significant
changes  in  Valero's  internal  controls,   or  in  other  factors  that  could
significantly affect internal controls, subsequent to the date of the certifying
officers'  certifications  pursuant to Rule 13a-14  included  with Valero's Form
10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002.

         connection with Valero's  execution of a placement agency agreement for

Undertakings.  For the purposes of complying  with the rules  governing Form S-8
under the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned  registrant  hereby undertakes
as  follows,   which   undertaking  shall  be  incorporated  by  reference  into
registrant's  Registration  Statements on Form S-8 No. 333-31709 (filed July 21,
1997), No. 333-31721 (filed July 21, 1997), No. 333-31723 (filed July 21, 1997),
No. 333-31727 (filed July 21, 1997), No. 333-81844 (filed January 31, 2002), and
No. 333-81858 (filed January 31, 2002):

Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to  directors,  officers  and  controlling  persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of  1933  and is,  therefore,  unenforceable.  In the  event  that a  claim  for
indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant of expenses  incurred or paid by a director,  officer or  controlling
person of the  registrant  in the  successful  defense  of any  action,  suit or
proceeding)  is  asserted by such  director,  officer or  controlling  person in
connection with the securities being registered,  the registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of  appropriate  jurisdiction  the  question  of whether  such
indemnification  by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Pursuant to the  requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934,  the  registrant  has duly  caused  this report to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Section 6.3 as of the date hereof.

Year 2 on Schedule 6.2 (Fixed Price Purchase  Option) shall be amended to delete
the  reference  to "n/a" and the  following  shall be inserted in lieu  thereof:
"227,263,725",  so that  the  Purchase  Price  for  exercise  of the  Option  in
accordance herewith shall be $227,263,725.  In determining this amended Purchase
Price for the  exercise  of the Option in Lease Year 2,  Lessor and Lessee  have
taken  into  consideration  all Lease  Payments  made and no refund of any Lease
Payment  shall be owed by  Lessor  to Lessee  nor  shall  any  additional  Lease
Payments be due or owing as of or after the Option  Closing  Date.  Accordingly,
notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.2 of the Lease,  the Purchase Price
provided  in  Section  2  hereof  shall  also  be the  Option  Closing  Payment.
Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Lease,  the Option Closing
Date shall be February 28, 2003.

     Section 3. Remaining Option Provision; Other Amendments.

     (a)  Except  as  provided  in  Sections  1 and 2  hereof,  the terms of the
exercise  of the  Option  shall  remain  the same and  shall be as set  forth in

     (b) Section  10.5 of the Lease is amended to reserve the right of Lessor to
grant easements, rights-of-way and access rights to EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P., a
Delaware  limited  partnership,  and EPN Gulf Coast,  L.P. , a Delaware  limited
partnership,  with respect to the natural gas and liquids  pipelines and related
facilities owned by such  partnerships  that are currently located on the Leased
Property, all on the same terms and conditions that Lessor reserves the right to
grant easements,  rights-of-way  and access rights with respect to the LPG/Crude
Property under Section 10.5.

     Section  4.  Entire  Agreement;   No  Further  Amendment.   This  Amendment
constitutes  the entire  agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.  Except as modified  hereby,  the Lease remains in full force and
effect  without  other  amendments  or  modifications.  For all purposes of this
Amendment,  the provisions of Sections 21.6, 21.7, 21.9, 21.10, 21.11, 21.12 and
21.13 of the Lease shall apply hereto as if incorporated herein by reference.

     Section 5.  Governing  Law.  This  Amendment  and the rights of the parties
hereunder  shall be governed by and  interpreted in accordance  with the laws of
the State of Texas  without  giving  effect to  principles  thereof  relating to
conflicts of law rules that would direct the  application of the laws of another
jurisdiction.

     Section  6.  Counterparts.  This  Amendment  may  be  executed  in  several
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original  but all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

            FIRST AMENDMENT TO PIPELINE AND TERMINAL LEASE AGREEMENT


         This First  Amendment,  dated February 28, 2003,  among Coastal Liquids
Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Lessor"),  and Valero Marketing
and  Supply  Company,  a Delaware  corporation  ("VMSC"),  and  Valero  Pipeline
Company, a Delaware  corporation ("VPC" and, together with VMSC,  "Lessee"),  to
the Pipeline and Terminal  Lease  Agreement  (the  "Lease")  dated May 25, 2001,
between Lessor and Lessee.  All capitalized  terms used herein which are defined
in the  Lease  shall  have  the  meaning  set  forth  therein  unless  otherwise
specifically provided herein.

         WHEREAS,  Lessor and Lessee desire for Lessee to exercise the Option at
an  earlier  date than  provided  in the Lease and  Lessor  and  Lessee are both
agreeable to such earlier exercise on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Amendment; and

         WHEREAS,  Lessor and Lessee desire to make certain modifications to the
Lease to provide for the earlier exercise of the Option.

         NOW,   THEREFORE,   in  consideration  of  the  premises  and  material
agreements  herein  contained  and other good and valuable  considerations,  the
receipt and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,  the parties hereto
agree as follows:

     Section 1. Consent to Early Exercise of Option.  Notwithstanding  the first
section of Section 6.3 of the Lease,  Lessor agrees that Lessee may exercise the
Option on the date hereof;  Lessee by execution of this  Amendment is giving the
Option Notice  required by Section 6.3 and Lessor,  by executing this Amendment,
agrees that the Lessee has duly and timely given the Option  Notice  required by
Section 6.3 as of the date hereof.

     Section 2. Purchase Price. Lessee and Lessor agree that the entry for Lease
Year 2 on Schedule 6.2 (Fixed Price Purchase  Option) shall be amended to delete
the  reference  to "n/a" and the  following  shall be inserted in lieu  thereof:
"61,986,275",  so  that  the  Purchase  Price  for  exercise  of the  Option  in
accordance  herewith shall be $61,986,275.  In determining this amended Purchase
Price for the  exercise  of the Option in Lease Year 2,  Lessor and Lessee  have
taken  into  consideration  all Lease  Payments  made and no refund of any Lease
Payment  shall be owed by  Lessor  to Lessee  nor  shall  any  additional  Lease
Payments be due or owing as of or after the Option  Closing  Date.  Accordingly,
notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.2 of the Lease,  the Purchase Price
provided  in  Section  2  hereof  shall  also  be the  Option  Closing  Payment.
Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Lease,  the Option Closing
Date shall be February 28, 2003.

     Section 3. Remaining Option Provision; Other Covenants.

     (a)  Except  as  provided  in  Sections  1 and 2  hereof,  the terms of the
exercise  of the  Option  shall  remain  the same and  shall be as set  forth in
Article 6 of the Lease.




     (b)  Attached  hereto as  Exhibit 1 is a listing of those  Pipeline  System
Interests  (the  "Schedule  10.3  Properties")  with  respect to which a further
delineation is required to be made of the interests in properties (including fee
and non-fee  interests),  easements,  leases,  subleases and property use rights
that are  contemplated or required to be reserved by, granted to or inure to the
benefit of  Lessee,  Lessor,  El Paso  South  Texas,  L.P.  or their  respective
Affiliates,  successors  or assigns  pursuant to Schedule 10.3 to the Lease (the
"Schedule  10.3  Interests").  At the Option  Closing,  Lessor  will  convey the
Pipeline  System  Properties to Lessee,  excepting  and reserving  therefrom the
Schedule 10.3  Interests  that are  contemplated  or required to be reserved by,
granted to or inure to the benefit of Lessor, El Paso South Texas, L.P. or their
respective  Affiliates,  successors or assigns  pursuant to Schedule 10.3 to the
Lease.  Lessor  and  Lessee  shall (i) act in good  faith  and use  commercially
reasonable  best efforts to further  delineate  the Schedule  10.3  Interests as
expeditiously as possible, (ii) immediately following the further delineation of
the Schedule  10.3  Interests  pursuant to clause (i) above,  prepare,  execute,
acknowledge,  deliver and record deeds,  easements,  leases,  subleases,  access
license  agreements and other agreements  expressly and definitively  reserving,
granting or otherwise  creating or providing for the Schedule 10.3  Interests to
or for the  benefit  of  Lessee,  Lessor,  El Paso South  Texas,  L.P.  or their
respective  Affiliates,  successors or assigns,  all as contemplated by Schedule
10.3 of the Lease, and (iii) prepare, execute,  acknowledge,  deliver and record
such  amendments to the conveyances of the Schedule 10.3 Properties to Lessee as
will properly reflect the matters provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

     (c)  Attached  hereto as  Exhibit 2 is a listing of those  Pipeline  System
Interests  (the "Special  Interests")  that are subject to certain  Restrictions
that are required to be satisfied prior to the  effectiveness  of the conveyance
thereof to Lessee  pursuant  to the  exercise  of the Option or with  respect to
which Lessee  desires that certain  alleged  title issues be satisfied  prior to
recording  the  conveyance  thereof to Lessee  pursuant  to the  exercise of the
Option  (collectively the "Requested  Actions").  At the Option Closing,  Lessor
will execute,  acknowledge and deliver  conveyances of the Special  Interests to
Lessee; provided, however, (i) any such conveyance of a Special Interest that is
subject to  Restrictions  that  preclude  conveyance  to Lessee shall not become
effective  or be  recorded  until  such  time as  such  Restrictions  have  been
satisfied with respect to the conveyance of such Special Interest from Lessor to
Lessee and (ii) any such  conveyance of a Special  Interest that is subject to a
Requested  Action that does not  constitute a Restriction  shall not be recorded
until such time as such Requested Action has been satisfied or such earlier time
as Lessee,  at its  option,  elects to record  such  conveyance.  Except for any
Restrictions,  Lessor and  Lessee  have not agreed  that the  Requested  Actions
constitute conditions to the transfer of the Special Interests, the delay in the
recording of such Special  Interests being done as an accommodation by Lessor to
Lessee.  Once all Restrictions  and Requested  Actions with respect to a Special
Interest have been satisfied, Lessee will promptly record the conveyance of such
Special Interest from Lessor to Lessee.  Until such time as (i) all Restrictions
with respect to the conveyance of a Special  Interest from Lessor to Lessee that
preclude  conveyance to Lessee have been  satisfied  and (ii) the  conveyance of
such Special  Interest from Lessor to Lessee is recorded in accordance  with the
foregoing conditions,  such Special Interest shall continue to be subject to all
applicable  provisions of the Lease and the Lease shall remain in full force and
effect with respect to such Special Interest (excluding, however, any obligation
to make any further Lease  Payments,  but not  excluding  the  obligation to pay
Supplemental  Rent and to pay or perform other  obligations under the Lease with
respect to such Special  Interest).



At such time as the  conveyance  of a Special  Interest from Lessor to Lessee is
recorded in accordance  with the  foregoing  conditions,  such Special  Interest
shall no longer be  subject  to the  Lease.  Subject  to the terms of the Lease,
Lessor and Lessee shall act in good faith and use  commercially  reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the  Restrictions  and to satisfy and complete the  Requested
Actions as  expeditiously  as possible.  The  identification  of Restrictions or
Requested  Actions,  the retention of the Special Interests and the Lessor's and
Lessee's  undertakings  to complete or satisfy the  Restrictions  and  Requested
Actions pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall not increase,  release, waive, amend
or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations, remedies and defenses of
Lessor and Lessee under the Lease or constitute or imply any agreement by Lessor
that any title defect exists with respect to any Special Interest.

     Section  4.  Entire  Agreement;   No  Further  Amendment.   This  Amendment
constitutes  the entire  agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.  Except as modified  hereby,  the Lease remains in full force and
effect  without  other  amendments  or  modifications.  For all purposes of this
Amendment,  the provisions of Sections 21.6, 21.7, 21.9, 21.10, 21.11, 21.12 and
21.13 of the Lease shall apply hereto as if incorporated herein by reference.

     Section 5.  Governing  Law.  This  Amendment  and the rights of the parties
hereunder  shall be governed by and  interpreted in accordance  with the laws of
the State of Texas  without  giving  effect to  principles  thereof  relating to
conflicts of law rules that would direct the  application of the laws of another
jurisdiction.

     Section  6.  Counterparts.  This  Amendment  may  be  executed  in  several
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original  but all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

     Section  7.  VPC  Option  Exercise.  VMSC  and VPC  jointly  and  severally
represent, warrant, acknowledge and confirm to Lessor (i) that VMSC and VPC have
elected to have VPC  exercise  the Option in its  entirety  such that all of the
Leased  Property  shall  be  conveyed  directly  to VPC in  accordance  with the
provisions  of the Lease and (ii) that VMSC hereby  waives any right to exercise
(in whole or in part) the Option.

                                Change of Control
                               Severance AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT,  dated as of the 19th day of March, 2003 (this "Agreement"),  by
and between Valero Energy Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation (the "Company"),
and William E. Greehey (the "Executive").

         WHEREAS,  the Board of  Directors  of the Company  (the  "Board"),  has
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its  stockholders
to assure that the Company will have the continued  dedication of the Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as
defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable
distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal  uncertainties  and risks
created  by a pending  or  threatened  Change of Control  and to  encourage  the
Executive's full attention and dedication to the current Company in the event of
any threatened or pending  Change of Control,  and to provide the Executive with
compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that
the  compensation  and benefits  expectations of the Executive will be satisfied
and that are competitive with those of other corporations.  Therefore,  in order
to accomplish these  objectives,  the Board has caused the Company to enter into
this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

     Section 1. Certain  Definitions.  (a) "Effective Date" means the first date
during  the Change of Control  Period (as  defined  herein) on which a Change of
Control occurs. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a
Change of Control occurs and if the  Executive's  employment with the Company is
terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is
reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (1)
was at the request of a third party that has taken steps  reasonably  calculated
to effect a Change of  Control  or (2)  otherwise  arose in  connection  with or
anticipation  of a Change  of  Control,  then  "Effective  Date"  means the date
immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.

     (b)  "Change of Control  Period"  means the period  commencing  on the date
hereof  and  ending  on the  third  anniversary  of the date  hereof;  provided,
however,  that,  commencing  on the date one year after the date hereof,  and on
each  annual  anniversary  of such date (such date and each  annual  anniversary
thereof,  the  "Renewal  Date"),  unless  previously  terminated,  the Change of
Control Period shall be  automatically  extended so as to terminate  three years
from such Renewal Date,  unless, at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date, the
Company  shall give notice to the  Executive  that the Change of Control  Period
shall not be so extended.

     (c) "Affiliated  Company" means any company  controlled by,  controlling or
under common control with the Company.

     (d) "Change of Control" means:

     (1) The acquisition by any individual,  entity or group (within the meaning
of Section  13(d)(3) or  14(d)(2) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as
amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial  ownership  (within the





meaning  of Rule 13d-3  promulgated  under the  Exchange  Act) of 20% or more of
either  (A) the  then-outstanding  shares of common  stock of the  Company  (the
"Outstanding  Company  Common  Stock") or (B) the  combined  voting power of the
then-outstanding  voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in
the  election  of  directors  (the  "Outstanding  Company  Voting  Securities");
provided,  however,  that, for purposes of this Section  1(d)(1),  the following
acquisitions  of  Outstanding  Company  Common Stock or of  Outstanding  Company
Voting Securities shall not constitute a Change of Control:  (i) any acquisition
directly  from the  Company,  (ii) any  acquisition  by the  Company,  (iii) any
acquisition  by any  employee  benefit  plan (or  related  trust)  sponsored  or
maintained by the Company or any Affiliated  Company or (iv) any  acquisition by
any  corporation   pursuant  to  a  transaction   that  complies  with  Sections
1(d)(3)(A), 1(d)(3)(B) and 1(d)(3)(C);

     (2)  Individuals  who,  as of the date  hereof,  constitute  the Board (the
"Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
Board; provided,  however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to
the date hereof whose  election,  or  nomination  for election by the  Company's
stockholders,  was  approved by a vote of at least a majority  of the  directors
then  comprising  the  Incumbent  Board  shall  be  considered  as  though  such
individual  were a  member  of the  Incumbent  Board,  but  excluding,  for this
purpose,  any such  individual  whose  initial  assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened  election contest with respect to the election
or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or
consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;

     (3) Consummation of a reorganization,  merger,  statutory share exchange or
consolidation or similar corporate  transaction  involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company  (each,  a "Business  Combination"),  in each case unless,
following  such  Business  Combination,  (A)  all  or  substantially  all of the
individuals  and entities  that were the  beneficial  owners of the  Outstanding
Company Common Stock and the Outstanding  Company Voting Securities  immediately
prior to such Business  Combination  beneficially  own,  directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the  then-outstanding  shares of common  stock and the combined
voting  power  of  the  then-outstanding  voting  securities  entitled  to  vote
generally in the election of directors,  as the case may be, of the  corporation
resulting  from such Business  Combination  (including,  without  limitation,  a
corporation  that, as a result of such  transaction,  owns the Company or all or
substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more
subsidiaries)  in   substantially   the  same  proportions  as  their  ownership
immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common
Stock and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities,  as the case may be, (B) no
Person  (excluding any corporation  resulting from such Business  Combination or
any employee  benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation
resulting  from  such  Business  Combination)  beneficially  owns,  directly  or
indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively,  the then-outstanding shares of common
stock  of the  corporation  resulting  from  such  Business  Combination  or the
combined  voting  power  of  the  then-outstanding  voting  securities  of  such
corporation,  except to the  extent  that such  ownership  existed  prior to the
Business Combination, and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of
directors of the  corporation  resulting  from such  Business  Combination  were
members  of the  Incumbent  Board at the time of the  execution  of the  initial
agreement or of the action of the Board providing for such Business Combination;
or




     (4) Approval by the  stockholders of the Company of a complete  liquidation
or dissolution of the Company.

     Section 2.  Employment  Period.  The Company  hereby agrees to continue the
Executive in its employ,  subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
for the  period  commencing  on the  Effective  Date  and  ending  on the  third
anniversary  of the Effective  Date (the  "Employment  Period").  The Employment
Period shall  terminate upon the  Executive's  termination of employment for any
reason.

     Section 3. Terms of  Employment.  (a) Position  and Duties.  (1) During the
Employment Period,  (A) the Executive's  position  (including  status,  offices,
titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall
be at least  commensurate in all material  respects with the most significant of
those  held,  exercised  and  assigned  at any time  during the  120-day  period
immediately  preceding the Effective Date and (B) the Executive's services shall
be  performed  at the  office  where  the  Executive  was  employed  immediately
preceding  the Effective  Date or at any other  location less than 35 miles from
such office.

     (2) During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and
sick leave to which the Executive is entitled,  the  Executive  agrees to devote
reasonable  attention and time during normal  business hours to the business and
affairs  of  the  Company  and,  to  the  extent   necessary  to  discharge  the
responsibilities  assigned to the Executive  hereunder,  to use the  Executive's
reasonable   best   efforts  to  perform   faithfully   and   efficiently   such
responsibilities.  During the Employment  Period, it shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate,  civic or charitable
boards or committees,  (B) deliver  lectures,  fulfill  speaking  engagements or
teach at educational  institutions and (C) manage personal investments,  so long
as such  activities do not  significantly  interfere with the performance of the
Executive's  responsibilities  as an employee of the Company in accordance  with
this Agreement.  It is expressly  understood and agreed that, to the extent that
any such  activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective
Date,  the continued  conduct of such  activities  (or the conduct of activities
similar in nature and scope thereto)  subsequent to the Effective Date shall not
thereafter  be deemed  to  interfere  with the  performance  of the  Executive's
responsibilities to the Company.

     (b)  Compensation.  (1) Base  Salary.  During the  Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall  receive an annual base salary (the "Annual Base Salary") at an
annual rate at least equal to 12 times the highest  monthly  base salary paid or
payable,  including  any base salary that has been earned but  deferred,  to the
Executive by the Company and the Affiliated Companies in respect of the 12-month
period  immediately  preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. The
Annual Base Salary shall be paid at such intervals as the Company pays executive
salaries  generally.  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall
be reviewed at least  annually,  beginning no more than 12 months after the last
salary  increase  awarded to the  Executive  prior to the  Effective  Date.  Any
increase in the Annual Base Salary  shall not serve to limit or reduce any other
obligation to the Executive under this  Agreement.  The Annual Base Salary shall
not be reduced  after any such  increase and the term "Annual Base Salary" shall
refer to the Annual Base Salary as so increased.



     (2) Annual  Bonus.  In addition to the Annual Base  Salary,  the  Executive
shall be awarded,  for each fiscal year ending during the Employment  Period, an
annual  bonus (the  "Annual  Bonus") in cash at least  equal to the  Executive's
highest bonus earned under the Company's  annual  incentive  bonus plans, or any
comparable  bonus under any predecessor or successor plan or plans, for the last
three full fiscal years prior to the  Effective  Date (or for such lesser number
of full fiscal years prior to the  Effective  Date for which the  Executive  was
eligible to earn such a bonus,  and  annualized  in the case of any bonus earned
for a partial  fiscal year) (the "Recent Annual  Bonus").  (If the Executive has
not been  eligible  to earn such a bonus for any period  prior to the  Effective
Date, the "Recent Annual Bonus" shall mean the  Executive's  target annual bonus
for the year in which the  Effective  Date occurs.) Each such Annual Bonus shall
be paid no  later  than  the end of the  third  month of the  fiscal  year  next
following  the fiscal  year for which the Annual  Bonus is  awarded,  unless the
Executive shall elect to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus.

     (3) Incentive,  Savings and Retirement Plans. During the Employment Period,
the Executive  shall be entitled to participate  in all  incentive,  savings and
retirement plans,  practices,  policies,  and programs  applicable  generally to
other peer  executives of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies,  but in no
event shall such plans,  practices,  policies and programs provide the Executive
with incentive  opportunities (measured with respect to both regular and special
incentive  opportunities,  to the  extent,  if any,  that  such  distinction  is
applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit opportunities, in each
case,  less  favorable,  in the  aggregate,  than  the most  favorable  of those
provided by the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies for the  Executive  under
such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any time during the
120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to
the Executive,  those provided generally at any time after the Effective Date to
other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

     (4) Welfare  Benefit  Plans.  During the Employment  Period,  the Executive
and/or  the  Executive's  family,  as the case may be,  shall  be  eligible  for
participation  in and shall receive all benefits  under welfare  benefit  plans,
practices,  policies  and  programs  provided by the Company and the  Affiliated
Companies (including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, vision,
disability,  employee life,  group life,  accidental  death and travel  accident
insurance plans and programs) to the extent  applicable  generally to other peer
executives of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies,  but in no event shall
such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive with benefits
that are less  favorable,  in the  aggregate,  than the most  favorable  of such
plans, practices,  policies and programs in effect for the Executive at any time
during the 120-day period  immediately  preceding the Effective Date or, if more
favorable  to the  Executive,  those  provided  generally  at any time after the
Effective  Date to other  peer  executives  of the  Company  and the  Affiliated
Companies.

     (5) Expenses. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled
to receive  prompt  reimbursement  for all reasonable  expenses  incurred by the
Executive  in  accordance  with  the  most  favorable  policies,  practices  and
procedures  of the  Company  and the  Affiliated  Companies  in  effect  for the
Executive  at any time  during the  120-day  period  immediately  preceding  the
Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at
any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and the
Affiliated Companies.



     (6) Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment  Period, the Executive shall be
entitled to fringe benefits,  including,  without limitation,  tax and financial
planning  services,  payment  of  club  dues,  and,  if  applicable,  use  of an
automobile  and  payment  of  related  expenses,  in  accordance  with  the most
favorable  plans,  practices,  programs  and  policies  of the  Company  and the
Affiliated  Companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day
period  immediately  preceding the Effective  Date or, if more  favorable to the
Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

     (7) Office and Support Staff.  During the Employment  Period, the Executive
shall be  entitled  to an office or offices of a size and with  furnishings  and
other appointments,  and to exclusive personal secretarial and other assistance,
at least equal to the most favorable of the foregoing  provided to the Executive
by the  Company  and the  Affiliated  Companies  at any time  during the 120-day
period  immediately  preceding the Effective  Date or, if more  favorable to the
Executive,  as provided  generally at any time  thereafter with respect to other
peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

     (8) Vacation. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled
to paid vacation in accordance with the most favorable plans, policies, programs
and practices of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies as in effect for the
Executive  at any time  during the  120-day  period  immediately  preceding  the
Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at
any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and the
Affiliated Companies.

     (9)   Immediate   Vesting   of   Outstanding   Equity   Incentive   Awards.
Notwithstanding  any provision in the  Company's  stock  incentive  plans or the
award  agreements  thereunder,  effective  immediately  upon the occurrence of a
Change  of  Control,   (A)  all  stock  options   (incentive  or  non-qualified)
outstanding  as of the  date of such  Change  of  Control,  which  are not  then
exercisable  and vested,  shall become fully  exercisable and vested to the full
extent of the original  grant and,  following  the  Executive's  termination  of
employment  for any reason,  shall remain  exercisable  for the remainder of the
original option term; (B) all restrictions and deferral  limitations  applicable
to any  restricted  stock  awards  outstanding  as of the date of such Change of
Control shall lapse,  and such restricted  stock awards shall become free of all
restrictions  and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the
original grant; and (C) all performance share awards  outstanding as of the date
of such Change of Control for any  outstanding  performance  periods shall fully
vest and be earned  and  payable  in full  based on the  deemed  achievement  of
performance at 200% of target level for the entire performance period.

     Section  4.  Termination  of  Employment.  (a)  Death  or  Disability.  The
Executive's  employment  shall  terminate  automatically  if the Executive  dies
during the Employment  Period. If the Company  determines in good faith that the
Executive  has a Disability  (as defined  herein)  that has occurred  during the
Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of  "Disability"),  it may give to
the Executive  written notice in accordance  with Section 11(b) of its intention
to  terminate  the  Executive's  employment.  In  such  event,  the  Executive's
employment  with the Company  shall  terminate  effective  on the 30th day after
receipt of such  notice by the  Executive  (the  "Disability  Effective  Date"),
provided that,  within the 30 days after such receipt,  the Executive  shall not
have returned to full-time  performance of the Executive's duties.  "Disability"



means the absence of the Executive from the Executive's  duties with the Company
on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity
due to mental or physical  illness that is  determined to be total and permanent
by a physician  selected by the Company or its  insurers and  acceptable  to the
Executive or the Executive's legal representative.

     (b) Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive's  employment during the
Employment Period for Cause. "Cause" means:

          (1) the  willful and  continued  failure of the  Executive  to perform
     substantially   the   Executive's   duties  (as   contemplated  by  Section
     3(a)(1)(A)) with the Company or any Affiliated Company (other than any such
     failure  resulting  from  incapacity  due to physical or mental  illness or
     following  the  Executive's  delivery of a Notice of  Termination  for Good
     Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to
     the  Executive by the Board or the Chief  Executive  Officer of the Company
     that  specifically  identifies  the  manner in which the Board or the Chief
     Executive  Officer  of the  Company  believes  that the  Executive  has not
     substantially performed the Executive's duties, or

          (2) the willful  engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross
     misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.

     For purposes of this Section  4(b),  no act, or failure to act, on the part
of the Executive shall be considered  "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to
be done,  by the  Executive in bad faith or without  reasonable  belief that the
Executive's  action or omission was in the best  interests  of the Company.  Any
act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive  Officer of
the  Company  or a senior  officer  of the  Company  or based upon the advice of
counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to
be  done,  by the  Executive  in good  faith  and in the best  interests  of the
Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be
for Cause unless and until there shall have been  delivered  to the  Executive a
copy of a  resolution  duly  adopted  by the  affirmative  vote of not less than
three-quarters  of the entire  membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such  purpose  (after  reasonable  notice is provided to the
Executive and the Executive is given an  opportunity,  together with counsel for
the  Executive,  to be heard before the Board),  finding that, in the good faith
opinion  of the Board,  the  Executive  is guilty of the  conduct  described  in
Section 4(b)(1) or 4(b)(2), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

     (c) Good  Reason.  The  Executive's  employment  may be  terminated  by the
Executive for Good Reason or by the Executive  voluntarily  without Good Reason.
"Good Reason" means:

               (1) the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in
          any respect with the Executive's position (including status,  offices,
          titles   and   reporting   requirements),    authority,    duties   or
          responsibilities as contemplated by Section  3(a)(1)(A),  or any other
          action by the Company that results in a diminution  in such  position,
          authority,  duties or responsibilities,  excluding for this purpose an
          isolated,  insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith
          and that is remedied by the Company  promptly  after receipt of notice
          thereof given by the Executive;


               (2)  any  failure  by  the  Company  to  comply  with  any of the
          provisions of Section 3(b), other than an isolated,  insubstantial and
          inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and that is remedied by
          the Company  promptly  after  receipt of notice  thereof  given by the
          Executive;

               (3) the Company's  requiring the Executive (i) to be based at any
          office or location other than as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(B),  (ii)
          to be based at a location other than the principal  executive  offices
          of  the  Company  if the  Executive  was  employed  at  such  location
          immediately  preceding  the  Effective  Date,  or (iii) to  travel  on
          Company  business to a  substantially  greater  extent  than  required
          immediately prior to the Effective Date;

               (4) any purported  termination by the Company of the  Executive's
          employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or

               (5) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section
          10(c).

         For purposes of this Section 4(c), any good faith determination of Good
Reason made by the Executive  shall be  conclusive.  The  Executive's  mental or
physical  incapacity  following the  occurrence of an event  described  above in
clauses (1) through (5) shall not affect the  Executive's  ability to  terminate
employment for Good Reason.

     (d) Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by
the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to
the other party  hereto  given in  accordance  with  Section  11(b).  "Notice of
Termination" means a written notice that (1) indicates the specific  termination
provision in this  Agreement  relied upon,  (2) to the extent  applicable,  sets
forth in  reasonable  detail  the facts and  circumstances  claimed to provide a
basis for  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  under the  provision so
indicated,  and (3) if the Date of Termination (as defined herein) is other than
the date of receipt of such notice,  specifies  the Date of  Termination  (which
Date of  Termination  shall be not more than 30 days  after  the  giving of such
notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice
of Termination  any fact or circumstance  that  contributes to a showing of Good
Reason or Cause  shall not waive  any  right of the  Executive  or the  Company,
respectively,  hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively,
from asserting  such fact or  circumstance  in enforcing the  Executive's or the
Company's respective rights hereunder.

     (e) Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" means (1) if the Executive's
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause,  or by the Executive for Good
Reason,  the date of  receipt  of the  Notice of  Termination  or any later date
specified  in  the  Notice  of  Termination,  as the  case  may  be,  (2) if the
Executive's  employment  is  terminated  by the Company  other than for Cause or
Disability,  the Date of  Termination  shall be the  date on which  the  Company
notifies  the  Executive  of  such  termination,  and  (3)  if  the  Executive's
employment  is  terminated  by  reason  of  death  or  Disability,  the  Date of
Termination  shall  be the  date of death  of the  Executive  or the  Disability
Effective Date, as the case may be.




     Section 5.  Obligations of the Company upon  Termination.  (a) Good Reason;
Other Than for Cause, Death or Disability. If, during the Employment Period, the
Company terminates the Executive's employment other than for Cause or Disability
or the Executive terminates employment for Good Reason:

          (1) the  Company  shall  pay to the  Executive,  in a lump sum in cash
     within  30  days  after  the  Date of  Termination,  the  aggregate  of the
     following amounts:

               (A) the sum of (i) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the
          Date of  Termination,  (ii) the product of (x) the Recent Annual Bonus
          and (y) a fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the number of days in
          the  current  fiscal  year  through  the Date of  Termination  and the
          denominator  of which is 365, and (iii) any accrued  vacation  pay, in
          each case, to the extent not theretofore  paid (the sum of the amounts
          described   in   subclauses   (i),   (ii)  and  (iii),   the  "Accrued
          Obligations");

               (B) the amount equal to the product of (i) three and (ii) the sum
          of (x) the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary and (y) the Recent  Annual
          Bonus;

               (C) an amount equal to the excess of (i) the actuarial equivalent
          of  the  benefit  under  the  Company's   qualified   defined  benefit
          retirement  plan  (the   "Retirement   Plan")   (utilizing   actuarial
          assumptions  no less  favorable to the Executive  than those in effect
          under the Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date) and
          any  excess or  supplemental  retirement  plan in which the  Executive
          participates  (collectively,  the  "SERP")  that the  Executive  would
          receive if the Executive's  employment continued for three years after
          the  Date of  Termination,  assuming  for  this  purpose  that (x) the
          Executive's  age and service  credit  increase  during the  three-year
          period,  (y)  all  accrued  benefits  are  fully  vested  and  (z) the
          Executive's  compensation  in each of the three years is that required
          by Sections 3(b)(1) and 3(b)(2), over (ii) the actuarial equivalent of
          the  Executive's  actual benefit (paid or payable),  if any, under the
          Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the Date of Termination; and

               (D) an amount  equal to the sum of the Company  matching or other
          Company   contributions   under  the   Company's   qualified   defined
          contribution plans and any excess or supplemental defined contribution
          plans in which the Executive  participates  that the  Executive  would
          receive if the Executive's  employment continued for three years after
          the  Date of  Termination,  assuming  for  this  purpose  that (x) the
          Executive's  benefits  under  such  plans  are fully  vested,  (y) the
          Executive's  compensation  in each of the three years is that required
          by Sections 3(b)(1) and 3(b)(2) and (z) to the extent that the Company
          contributions  are determined based on the  contributions or deferrals
          of the  Executive,  that  the  Executive's  contribution  or  deferral
          elections,  as appropriate,  are those in effect immediately prior the
          Date of Termination; and

          (2) for three years after the Executive's Date of Termination, or such
     longer  period as may be  provided  by the terms of the  appropriate  plan,



     program,  practice or policy,  the Company shall  continue  benefits to the
     Executive and/or the Executive's  family at least equal to those that would
     have  been  provided  to them  in  accordance  with  the  plans,  programs,
     practices  and  policies  described  in Section  3(b)(4) and 3(b)(6) if the
     Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the
     Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time  thereafter with respect to
     other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies and their
     families, provided, however, that, if the Executive becomes reemployed with
     another  employer  and is  eligible to receive the  benefits  described  in
     Section 3(b)(4) under another employer provided plan, the medical and other
     welfare  benefits  described  herein shall be  secondary to those  provided
     under such other plan during such  applicable  period of  eligibility.  For
     purposes of determining  eligibility  (but not the time of  commencement of
     benefits) of the  Executive  for retiree  benefits  pursuant to such plans,
     practices, programs and policies, the Executive shall be considered to have
     remained employed (for purposes of both age and service credit) until three
     years after the Date of Termination  and to have retired on the last day of
     such period;

          (3) during the 12-month period following the Date of Termination,  the
     Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred,  provide the Executive with
     outplacement  services the scope and provider of which shall be selected by
     the Executive in the Executive's sole  discretion,  provided that, the cost
     of such  outplacement  shall not exceed  $25,000 (as adjusted for inflation
     based  on  the  Consumer  Price  Index  or  another  nationally  recognized
     published inflation index); and

          (4) to the extent not theretofore paid or provided,  the Company shall
     timely pay or  provide  to the  Executive  any other  amounts  or  benefits
     required  to be paid or  provided  or that the  Executive  is  eligible  to
     receive  under any  plan,  program,  policy  or  practice  or  contract  or
     agreement of the Company and the Affiliated Companies,  including,  without
     limitation, the Employment Agreement between the Company and the Executive,
     dated as of March 25th, 1999, as amended from time to time (the "Employment
     Agreement") (such other amounts and benefits, the "Other Benefits").

     (b) Death.  If the  Executive's  employment  is terminated by reason of the
Executive's  death during the Employment  Period,  the Company shall provide the
Executive's estate or beneficiaries with the Accrued  Obligations and the timely
payment or delivery  of the Other  Benefits,  and shall have no other  severance
obligations under this Agreement.  The Accrued  Obligations shall be paid to the
Executive's estate or beneficiary,  as applicable,  in a lump sum in cash within
30 days of the Date of  Termination.  With respect to the provision of the Other
Benefits,  the term "Other  Benefits"  as utilized  in this  Section  5(b) shall
include,  without  limitation,  and the Executive's estate and/or  beneficiaries
shall be  entitled to  receive,  benefits  at least equal to the most  favorable
benefits provided by the Company and the Affiliated Companies to the estates and
beneficiaries  of peer  executives of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies
under such plans,  programs,  practices and policies relating to death benefits,
if  any,  as  in  effect  with  respect  to  other  peer  executives  and  their
beneficiaries  at any time during the 120-day period  immediately  preceding the
Effective  Date or, if more  favorable  to the  Executive's  estate  and/or  the
Executive's  beneficiaries,  as in effect on the date of the  Executive's  death
with  respect  to  other  peer  executives  of the  Company  and the  Affiliated
Companies and their beneficiaries.



     (c) Disability.  If the  Executive's  employment is terminated by reason of
the  Executive's  Disability  during the  Employment  Period,  the Company shall
provide the Executive  with the Accrued  Obligations  and the timely  payment or
delivery of the Other Benefits,  and shall have no other  severance  obligations
under this Agreement.  The Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in
a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of  Termination.  With  respect to
the provision of the Other  Benefits,  the term "Other  Benefits" as utilized in
this Section 5(c) shall include,  and the Executive  shall be entitled after the
Disability  Effective  Date to receive,  disability  and other benefits at least
equal to the most favorable of those  generally  provided by the Company and the
Affiliated  Companies to disabled executives and/or their families in accordance
with such plans,  programs,  practices and policies  relating to disability,  if
any, as in effect  generally  with  respect to other peer  executives  and their
families  at any time  during  the  120-day  period  immediately  preceding  the
Effective  Date or, if more  favorable to the Executive  and/or the  Executive's
family, as in effect at any time thereafter generally with respect to other peer
executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies and their families.

     (d) Cause;  Other Than for Good Reason.  If the  Executive's  employment is
terminated for Cause during the Employment  Period, the Company shall provide to
the  Executive  (1) the  Executive's  Annual  Base  Salary  through  the Date of
Termination,  (2) any accrued vacation pay, and (3) the Other Benefits,  in each
case,  to the  extent  theretofore  unpaid,  and shall  have no other  severance
obligations  under  this  Agreement.  If the  Executive  voluntarily  terminates
employment  during the  Employment  Period,  excluding  a  termination  for Good
Reason,  the Company shall provide to the Executive the Accrued  Obligations and
the timely  payment or delivery of the Other  Benefits,  and shall have no other
severance  obligations  under  this  Agreement.  In such case,  all the  Accrued
Obligations  shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days
of the Date of Termination.

     Section 6.  Non-exclusivity  of Rights.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall
prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan,
program,  policy or practice provided by the Company or the Affiliated Companies
and for which the Executive may qualify,  nor,  subject to Section 11(f) and the
proviso of the last sentence of this Section 6, shall  anything  herein limit or
otherwise  affect such rights as the Executive may have under any other contract
or agreement with the Company or the Affiliated  Companies,  including,  without
limitation,  the Employment Agreement.  Amounts that are vested benefits or that
the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy,  practice
or program of or any other contract or agreement, including, without limitation,
the Employment  Agreement,  with the Company or the  Affiliated  Companies at or
subsequent to the Date of Termination  shall be payable in accordance  with such
plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement, except as explicitly
modified by this  Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if the Executive
receives payments and benefits  pursuant to Section 5(a) of this Agreement,  the
Executive  shall not be entitled  to any  severance  pay or  benefits  under any
severance plan,  program or policy of the Company and the Affiliated  Companies,
unless otherwise  specifically  provided therein by a specific reference to this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained
herein,  if the  Executive  is entitled  to receive a payment,  benefit or right
under the Employment  Agreement that is in addition to those provided under this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit him from receiving
such payment,  benefit or right,  and, if the Executive is entitled to receive a
payment,  benefit or right  pursuant to both this  Agreement and the  Employment
Agreement,  the  Executive  shall be entitled to the more  favorable of any such



payment, benefit or right, whether based on a provision of this Agreement or the
Employment  Agreement or a combination of the provisions  under such agreements;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Executive be entitled to duplicate
payments, rights or benefits.

     Section 7. Full Settlement.  The Company's  obligation to make the payments
provided  for in  this  Agreement  and  otherwise  to  perform  its  obligations
hereunder  shall  not be  affected  by any  set-off,  counterclaim,  recoupment,
defense,  or other claim,  right or action that the Company may have against the
Executive or others.  In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other
employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts  payable
to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts
shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.  The
Company  agrees to pay as  incurred,  to the full extent  permitted  by law, all
legal fees and expenses that the Executive may  reasonably  incur as a result of
any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or
others of the validity or  enforceability  of, or liability under, any provision
of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (including as a result
of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this
Agreement),  plus,  in  each  case,  interest  on  any  delayed  payment  at the
applicable  federal rate provided for in Section  7872(f)(2)(A)  of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

          Section 8. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

     (a)  Anything in this  Agreement to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  in the
event it shall be determined  that any payment or distribution by the Company or
its Affiliated Companies to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or
payable or distributed or distributable  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
or otherwise,  but determined without regard to any additional payments required
under this Section 8) (a  "Payment")  would be subject to the excise tax imposed
by Section  4999 of the Code or any  interest or  penalties  are incurred by the
Executive  with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,  together  with any
such interest and penalties,  collectively the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive
shall be entitled to receive an additional  payment (the "Gross-Up  Payment") in
an amount such that,  after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties  imposed with respect to such taxes),  including,  without
limitation,  any income  taxes (and any  interest  and  penalties  imposed  with
respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive
retains an amount of the Gross-Up  Payment  equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon
the Payments.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 8(c), all determinations  required
to be made under this Section 8, including  whether and when a Gross-Up  Payment
is  required,  the amount of such  Gross-Up  Payment and the  assumptions  to be
utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by Ernst & Young, LLP,
or such other nationally  recognized  certified public accounting firm as may be
designated by the Executive, subject to the Company's approval which will not be
unreasonably withheld (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15
business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive  that there has been a
Payment or such earlier  time as is requested by the Company.  In the event that
the  Accounting  Firm is serving as  accountant  or auditor for the  individual,
entity or group effecting the Change of Control,  the Executive,  subject to the
Company's approval which will not be unreasonably  withheld, may appoint another
nationally  recognized  accounting  firm to  make  the  determinations  required



hereunder  (which  accounting  firm shall then be referred to as the  Accounting
Firm  hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the  Accounting  Firm shall be borne
solely by the Company.  Any Gross-Up  Payment,  as  determined  pursuant to this
Section 8, shall be paid by the  Company to the  Executive  within 5 days of the
receipt  of  the  Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any  determination  by the
Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result
of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of
the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder,  it is possible that
Gross-Up  Payments that will not have been made by the Company  should have been
made (the "Underpayment"),  consistent with the calculations required to be made
hereunder.  In the event the Company  exhausts its remedies  pursuant to Section
8(c) and the  Executive  thereafter  is required to make a payment of any Excise
Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has
occurred and any such  Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or
for the benefit of the Executive.

     (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the
Internal  Revenue Service that, if successful,  would require the payment by the
Company of the Gross-Up  Payment.  Such  notification  shall be given as soon as
practicable,  but no later than 10 business days after the Executive is informed
in writing of such claim.  The Executive shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is  requested  to be paid.  The
Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which the  Executive  gives such notice to the Company (or
such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to
such claim is due).  If the Company  notifies the  Executive in writing prior to
the  expiration  of such period that the Company  desires to contest such claim,
the Executive shall:

          (1) give the  Company  any  information  reasonably  requested  by the
     Company relating to such claim,

          (2) take such action in connection  with  contesting such claim as the
     Company shall reasonably  request in writing from time to time,  including,
     without  limitation,  accepting legal  representation  with respect to such
     claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

          (3) cooperate  with the Company in good faith in order  effectively to
     contest such claim, and

          (4) permit the Company to participate in any  proceedings  relating to
     such claim;

     provided,  however,  that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs
and  expenses   (including   additional  interest  and  penalties)  incurred  in
connection  with  such  contest,  and  shall  indemnify  and hold the  Executive
harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  for any Excise Tax or income tax  (including
interest and penalties)  imposed as a result of such  representation and payment
of costs and expenses.  Without  limitation on the foregoing  provisions of this
Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with
such  contest,  and,  at its sole  discretion,  may  pursue or forgo any and all
administrative   appeals,   proceedings,   hearings  and  conferences  with  the
applicable  taxing  authority  in  respect  of such  claim and may,  at its sole



discretion,  either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate  taxing  authority on
behalf of the  Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest
the claim in any permissible  manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided,  however, that, if the Company pays such claim and directs
the  Executive to sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  indemnify  and hold the
Executive  harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties)  imposed with respect to such payment or with
respect to any imputed  income in connection  with such  payment;  and provided,
further, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of
taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
amount  is  claimed  to be due is  limited  solely  to  such  contested  amount.
Furthermore,  the  Company's  control of the contest  shall be limited to issues
with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable  hereunder,  and the
Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

     (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or payment
by the Company of an amount on the Executive's  behalf pursuant to Section 8(c),
the Executive  becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise
Tax to which such Gross-Up  Payment  relates or with respect to such claim,  the
Executive  shall (subject to the Company's  complying with the  requirements  of
Section  8(c),  if  applicable)  promptly  pay to the Company the amount of such
refund  (together  with  any  interest  paid or  credited  thereon  after  taxes
applicable  thereto).  If,  after  payment  by the  Company  of an amount on the
Executive's  behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), a  determination  is made that the
Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the
Company  does not notify the  Executive in writing of its intent to contest such
denial of refund prior to the  expiration  of 30 days after such  determination,
then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount
of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may,
in its sole discretion,  withhold and pay to the Internal Revenue Service or any
other applicable taxing authority,  for the benefit of the Executive, all or any
portion of any  Gross-Up  Payment,  and the  Executive  hereby  consents to such
withholding.

     Section  9.  Confidential  Information.  The  Executive  shall  hold  in  a
fiduciary  capacity  for the benefit of the  Company all secret or  confidential
information,  knowledge  or  data  relating  to the  Company  or the  Affiliated
Companies, and their respective businesses, which information, knowledge or data
shall have been obtained by the Executive  during the Executive's  employment by
the Company or the Affiliated Companies and which information, knowledge or data
shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives  of  the  Executive  in  violation  of  this  Agreement).  After
termination of the Executive's  employment with the Company, the Executive shall
not,  without the prior  written  consent of the Company or as may  otherwise be
required by law or legal process,  communicate or divulge any such  information,
knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those persons  designated
by the Company.  In no event shall an asserted  violation of the  provisions  of
this  Section 9  constitute a basis for  deferring  or  withholding  any amounts
otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.



     Section 10.  Successors.  (a) This  Agreement is personal to the Executive,
and,  without the prior written consent of the Company,  shall not be assignable
by the  Executive  other than by will or the laws of descent  and  distribution.
This  Agreement  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of and  be  enforceable  by the
Executive's legal representatives.

     (b) This  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and be binding  upon the
Company and its  successors  and assigns.  Except as provided in Section  10(c),
without the prior written consent of the Executive,  this Agreement shall not be
assignable by the Company.

     (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect,  by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business  and/or assets of the Company to assume  expressly and agree to perform
this  Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would
be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. "Company" means
the Company as  hereinbefore  defined and any  successor to its business  and/or
assets as  aforesaid  that  assumes  and agrees to  perform  this  Agreement  by
operation of law or otherwise.

     Section  11.  Miscellaneous.  (a) This  Agreement  shall be governed by and
construed  in  accordance  with  the  laws of the  State  of  Delaware,  without
reference to principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are
not part of the  provisions  hereof  and  shall  have no force or  effect.  This
Agreement  may not be amended  or  modified  other  than by a written  agreement
executed  by the  parties  hereto  or  their  respective  successors  and  legal
representatives.

     (b) All notices and other communications  hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

          if to the  Executive:  At the  most  recent  address  on  file  in the
          Company's records

                               Attention: Corporate Secretary

or to such other  address as either  party shall have  furnished to the other in
writing in accordance  herewith.  Notice and  communications  shall be effective
when actually received by the addressee.

     (c) The invalidity or  unenforceability  of any provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other provision of this
Agreement.

     (d) The Company may withhold from any amounts  payable under this Agreement
such United States federal, state or local or foreign taxes as shall be required
to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

     (e)  The  Executive's  or the  Company's  failure  to  insist  upon  strict
compliance  with any  provision  of this  Agreement or the failure to assert any
right the  Executive  or the  Company  may have  hereunder,  including,  without
limitation,  the right of the Executive to terminate  employment for Good Reason



pursuant to Sections 4(c)(1) through 4(c)(5), shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.

     (f) The Executive and the Company acknowledge that, except as may otherwise
be provided  under any other  written  agreement  between the  Executive and the
Company,  the  employment  of the  Executive  by the  Company  is "at will" and,
subject to Section 1(a), prior to the Effective Date, the Executive's employment
may be  terminated  by either the  Executive or the Company at any time prior to
the Effective  Date, in which case the  Executive  shall have no further  rights
under this  Agreement.  From and after the date  hereof,  this  Agreement  shall
supersede  the  Executive  Severance  Agreement  between  the  Company  and  the
Executive, dated December 15, 1982.

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Executive has hereunto set the  Executive's  hand
and, pursuant to the authorization  from the Board, the Company has caused these
presents to be  executed  in its name on its behalf,  all as of the day and year
first above written.

                                          By:        /s/ Keith D. Booke
                                          -------------------------------------
                                          Name: Keith D. Booke
                                          Title:  Executive Vice President and
                                                  Chief Administrative Officer





                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.9
                                Change of Control
                               Severance AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT,  dated as of the 19th day of March, 2003 (this "Agreement"),  by
and between Valero Energy Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation (the "Company"),
and Gregory C. King (the "Executive").

     WHEREAS,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  (the  "Board"),  has
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its  stockholders
to assure that the Company will have the continued  dedication of the Executive,
notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as
defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable
distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal  uncertainties  and risks
created  by a pending  or  threatened  Change of Control  and to  encourage  the
Executive's full attention and dedication to the current Company in the event of
any threatened or pending  Change of Control,  and to provide the Executive with
compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that
the  compensation  and benefits  expectations of the Executive will be satisfied
and that are competitive with those of other corporations.  Therefore,  in order
to accomplish these  objectives,  the Board has caused the Company to enter into
this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

     Section 1. Certain  Definitions.  (a) "Effective Date" means the first date
during  the Change of Control  Period (as  defined  herein) on which a Change of
Control occurs. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if a
Change of Control occurs and if the  Executive's  employment with the Company is
terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is
reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (1)
was at the request of a third party that has taken steps  reasonably  calculated
to effect a Change of  Control  or (2)  otherwise  arose in  connection  with or
anticipation  of a Change  of  Control,  then  "Effective  Date"  means the date
immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.

     (b)  "Change of Control  Period"  means the period  commencing  on the date
hereof  and  ending  on the  third  anniversary  of the date  hereof;  provided,
however,  that,  commencing  on the date one year after the date hereof,  and on
each  annual  anniversary  of such date (such date and each  annual  anniversary
thereof,  the  "Renewal  Date"),  unless  previously  terminated,  the Change of
Control Period shall be  automatically  extended so as to terminate  three years
from such Renewal Date,  unless, at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date, the
Company  shall give notice to the  Executive  that the Change of Control  Period
shall not be so extended.

     (c) "Affiliated  Company" means any company  controlled by,  controlling or
under common control with the Company.

     (d) "Change of Control" means:

     (1) The acquisition by any individual,  entity or group (within the meaning
of Section  13(d)(3) or  14(d)(2) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as



amended (the "Exchange Act")) (a "Person") of beneficial  ownership  (within the
meaning  of Rule 13d-3  promulgated  under the  Exchange  Act) of 20% or more of
either  (A) the  then-outstanding  shares of common  stock of the  Company  (the
"Outstanding  Company  Common  Stock") or (B) the  combined  voting power of the
then-outstanding  voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in
the  election  of  directors  (the  "Outstanding  Company  Voting  Securities");
provided,  however,  that, for purposes of this Section  1(d)(1),  the following
acquisitions  of  Outstanding  Company  Common Stock or of  Outstanding  Company
Voting Securities shall not constitute a Change of Control:  (i) any acquisition
directly  from the  Company,  (ii) any  acquisition  by the  Company,  (iii) any
acquisition  by any  employee  benefit  plan (or  related  trust)  sponsored  or
maintained by the Company or any Affiliated  Company or (iv) any  acquisition by
any  corporation   pursuant  to  a  transaction   that  complies  with  Sections
1(d)(3)(A), 1(d)(3)(B) and 1(d)(3)(C);

     (2)  Individuals  who,  as of the date  hereof,  constitute  the Board (the
"Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
Board; provided,  however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to
the date hereof whose  election,  or  nomination  for election by the  Company's
stockholders,  was  approved by a vote of at least a majority  of the  directors
then  comprising  the  Incumbent  Board  shall  be  considered  as  though  such
individual  were a  member  of the  Incumbent  Board,  but  excluding,  for this
purpose,  any such  individual  whose  initial  assumption of office occurs as a
result of an actual or threatened  election contest with respect to the election
or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or
consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;

     (3) Consummation of a reorganization,  merger,  statutory share exchange or
consolidation or similar corporate  transaction  involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company  (each,  a "Business  Combination"),  in each case unless,
following  such  Business  Combination,  (A)  all  or  substantially  all of the
individuals  and entities  that were the  beneficial  owners of the  Outstanding
Company Common Stock and the Outstanding  Company Voting Securities  immediately
prior to such Business  Combination  beneficially  own,  directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the  then-outstanding  shares of common  stock and the combined
voting  power  of  the  then-outstanding  voting  securities  entitled  to  vote
generally in the election of directors,  as the case may be, of the  corporation
resulting  from such Business  Combination  (including,  without  limitation,  a
corporation  that, as a result of such  transaction,  owns the Company or all or
substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more
subsidiaries)  in   substantially   the  same  proportions  as  their  ownership
immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common
Stock and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities,  as the case may be, (B) no
Person  (excluding any corporation  resulting from such Business  Combination or
any employee  benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such corporation
resulting  from  such  Business  Combination)  beneficially  owns,  directly  or
indirectly, 20% or more of, respectively,  the then-outstanding shares of common
stock  of the  corporation  resulting  from  such  Business  Combination  or the
combined  voting  power  of  the  then-outstanding  voting  securities  of  such
corporation,  except to the  extent  that such  ownership  existed  prior to the
Business Combination, and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of
directors of the  corporation  resulting  from such  Business  Combination  were
members  of the  Incumbent  Board at the time of the  execution  of the  initial
agreement or of the action of the Board providing for such Business Combination;
or


     (4) Approval by the  stockholders of the Company of a complete  liquidation
or dissolution of the Company.

     Section 2.  Employment  Period.  The Company  hereby agrees to continue the
Executive in its employ,  subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
for the  period  commencing  on the  Effective  Date  and  ending  on the  third
anniversary  of the Effective  Date (the  "Employment  Period").  The Employment
Period shall  terminate upon the  Executive's  termination of employment for any
reason.

     Section 3. Terms of  Employment.  (a) Position  and Duties.  (1) During the
Employment Period,  (A) the Executive's  position  (including  status,  offices,
titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall
be at least  commensurate in all material  respects with the most significant of
those  held,  exercised  and  assigned  at any time  during the  120-day  period
immediately  preceding the Effective Date and (B) the Executive's services shall
be  performed  at the  office  where  the  Executive  was  employed  immediately
preceding  the Effective  Date or at any other  location less than 35 miles from
such office.

     (2) During the Employment Period, and excluding any periods of vacation and
sick leave to which the Executive is entitled,  the  Executive  agrees to devote
reasonable  attention and time during normal  business hours to the business and
affairs  of  the  Company  and,  to  the  extent   necessary  to  discharge  the
responsibilities  assigned to the Executive  hereunder,  to use the  Executive's
reasonable   best   efforts  to  perform   faithfully   and   efficiently   such
responsibilities.  During the Employment  Period, it shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate,  civic or charitable
boards or committees,  (B) deliver  lectures,  fulfill  speaking  engagements or
teach at educational  institutions and (C) manage personal investments,  so long
as such  activities do not  significantly  interfere with the performance of the
Executive's  responsibilities  as an employee of the Company in accordance  with
this Agreement.  It is expressly  understood and agreed that, to the extent that
any such  activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective
Date,  the continued  conduct of such  activities  (or the conduct of activities
similar in nature and scope thereto)  subsequent to the Effective Date shall not
thereafter  be deemed  to  interfere  with the  performance  of the  Executive's
responsibilities to the Company.

     (b)  Compensation.  (1) Base  Salary.  During the  Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall  receive an annual base salary (the "Annual Base Salary") at an
annual rate at least equal to 12 times the highest  monthly  base salary paid or
payable,  including  any base salary that has been earned but  deferred,  to the
Executive by the Company and the Affiliated Companies in respect of the 12-month
period  immediately  preceding the month in which the Effective Date occurs. The
Annual Base Salary shall be paid at such intervals as the Company pays executive
salaries  generally.  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall
be reviewed at least  annually,  beginning no more than 12 months after the last
salary  increase  awarded to the  Executive  prior to the  Effective  Date.  Any
increase in the Annual Base Salary  shall not serve to limit or reduce any other
obligation to the Executive under this  Agreement.  The Annual Base Salary shall
not be reduced  after any such  increase and the term "Annual Base Salary" shall
refer to the Annual Base Salary as so increased.



     (2) Annual  Bonus.  In addition to the Annual Base  Salary,  the  Executive
shall be awarded,  for each fiscal year ending during the Employment  Period, an
annual  bonus (the  "Annual  Bonus") in cash at least  equal to the  Executive's
highest bonus earned under the Company's  annual  incentive  bonus plans, or any
comparable  bonus under any predecessor or successor plan or plans, for the last
three full fiscal years prior to the  Effective  Date (or for such lesser number
of full fiscal years prior to the  Effective  Date for which the  Executive  was
eligible to earn such a bonus,  and  annualized  in the case of any bonus earned
for a partial  fiscal year) (the "Recent Annual  Bonus").  (If the Executive has
not been  eligible  to earn such a bonus for any period  prior to the  Effective
Date, the "Recent Annual Bonus" shall mean the  Executive's  target annual bonus
for the year in which the  Effective  Date occurs.) Each such Annual Bonus shall
be paid no  later  than  the end of the  third  month of the  fiscal  year  next
following  the fiscal  year for which the Annual  Bonus is  awarded,  unless the
Executive shall elect to defer the receipt of such Annual Bonus.

     (3) Incentive,  Savings and Retirement Plans. During the Employment Period,
the Executive  shall be entitled to participate  in all  incentive,  savings and
retirement plans,  practices,  policies,  and programs  applicable  generally to
other peer  executives of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies,  but in no
event shall such plans,  practices,  policies and programs provide the Executive
with incentive  opportunities (measured with respect to both regular and special
incentive  opportunities,  to the  extent,  if any,  that  such  distinction  is
applicable), savings opportunities and retirement benefit opportunities, in each
case,  less  favorable,  in the  aggregate,  than  the most  favorable  of those
provided by the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies for the  Executive  under
such plans, practices, policies and programs as in effect at any time during the
120-day period immediately preceding the Effective Date or, if more favorable to
the Executive,  those provided generally at any time after the Effective Date to
other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

     (4) Welfare  Benefit  Plans.  During the Employment  Period,  the Executive
and/or  the  Executive's  family,  as the case may be,  shall  be  eligible  for
participation  in and shall receive all benefits  under welfare  benefit  plans,
practices,  policies  and  programs  provided by the Company and the  Affiliated
Companies (including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, vision,
disability,  employee life,  group life,  accidental  death and travel  accident
insurance plans and programs) to the extent  applicable  generally to other peer
executives of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies,  but in no event shall
such plans, practices, policies and programs provide the Executive with benefits
that are less  favorable,  in the  aggregate,  than the most  favorable  of such
plans, practices,  policies and programs in effect for the Executive at any time
during the 120-day period  immediately  preceding the Effective Date or, if more
favorable  to the  Executive,  those  provided  generally  at any time after the
Effective  Date to other  peer  executives  of the  Company  and the  Affiliated
Companies.

     (5) Expenses. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled
to receive  prompt  reimbursement  for all reasonable  expenses  incurred by the
Executive  in  accordance  with  the  most  favorable  policies,  practices  and
procedures  of the  Company  and the  Affiliated  Companies  in  effect  for the
Executive  at any time  during the  120-day  period  immediately  preceding  the
Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at
any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and the
Affiliated Companies.



     (6) Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment  Period, the Executive shall be
entitled to fringe benefits,  including,  without limitation,  tax and financial
planning  services,  payment  of  club  dues,  and,  if  applicable,  use  of an
automobile  and  payment  of  related  expenses,  in  accordance  with  the most
favorable  plans,  practices,  programs  and  policies  of the  Company  and the
Affiliated  Companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the 120-day
period  immediately  preceding the Effective  Date or, if more  favorable to the
Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time thereafter with respect to other
peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

     (7) Office and Support Staff.  During the Employment  Period, the Executive
shall be  entitled  to an office or offices of a size and with  furnishings  and
other appointments,  and to exclusive personal secretarial and other assistance,
at least equal to the most favorable of the foregoing  provided to the Executive
by the  Company  and the  Affiliated  Companies  at any time  during the 120-day
period  immediately  preceding the Effective  Date or, if more  favorable to the
Executive,  as provided  generally at any time  thereafter with respect to other
peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies.

     (8) Vacation. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled
to paid vacation in accordance with the most favorable plans, policies, programs
and practices of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies as in effect for the
Executive  at any time  during the  120-day  period  immediately  preceding  the
Effective Date or, if more favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally at
any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and the
Affiliated Companies.

     (9)   Immediate   Vesting   of   Outstanding   Equity   Incentive   Awards.
Notwithstanding  any provision in the  Company's  stock  incentive  plans or the
award  agreements  thereunder,  effective  immediately  upon the occurrence of a
Change  of  Control,   (A)  all  stock  options   (incentive  or  non-qualified)
outstanding  as of the  date of such  Change  of  Control,  which  are not  then
exercisable  and vested,  shall become fully  exercisable and vested to the full
extent of the original  grant and,  following  the  Executive's  termination  of
employment for any reason,  shall remain exercisable for the shorter of (x) five
years  from  the  Executive's  date of  termination  of  employment  and (y) the
remainder  of the  original  option  term;  (B) all  restrictions  and  deferral
limitations applicable to any restricted stock awards outstanding as of the date
of such Change of Control shall lapse,  and such  restricted  stock awards shall
become free of all  restrictions and become fully vested and transferable to the
full  extent  of the  original  grant;  and (C)  all  performance  share  awards
outstanding  as of the  date of  such  Change  of  Control  for any  outstanding
performance  periods shall fully vest and be earned and payable in full based on
the deemed  achievement  of  performance  at 200% of target level for the entire
performance period.

     Section  4.  Termination  of  Employment.  (a)  Death  or  Disability.  The
Executive's  employment  shall  terminate  automatically  if the Executive  dies
during the Employment  Period. If the Company  determines in good faith that the
Executive  has a Disability  (as defined  herein)  that has occurred  during the
Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of  "Disability"),  it may give to
the Executive  written notice in accordance  with Section 11(b) of its intention
to  terminate  the  Executive's  employment.  In  such  event,  the  Executive's
employment  with the Company  shall  terminate  effective  on the 30th day after
receipt of such  notice by the  Executive  (the  "Disability  Effective  Date"),
provided that,  within the 30 days after such receipt,  the Executive  shall not



have returned to full-time  performance of the Executive's duties.  "Disability"
means the absence of the Executive from the Executive's  duties with the Company
on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days as a result of incapacity
due to mental or physical  illness that is  determined to be total and permanent
by a physician  selected by the Company or its  insurers and  acceptable  to the
Executive or the Executive's legal representative.

     (b) Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive's  employment during the
Employment Period for Cause. "Cause" means:

          (1) the  willful and  continued  failure of the  Executive  to perform
     substantially   the   Executive's   duties  (as   contemplated  by  Section
     3(a)(1)(A)) with the Company or any Affiliated Company (other than any such
     failure  resulting  from  incapacity  due to physical or mental  illness or
     following  the  Executive's  delivery of a Notice of  Termination  for Good
     Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to
     the  Executive by the Board or the Chief  Executive  Officer of the Company
     that  specifically  identifies  the  manner in which the Board or the Chief
     Executive  Officer  of the  Company  believes  that the  Executive  has not
     substantially performed the Executive's duties, or

          (2) the willful  engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross
     misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.

     For purposes of this Section  4(b),  no act, or failure to act, on the part
of the Executive shall be considered  "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to
be done,  by the  Executive in bad faith or without  reasonable  belief that the
Executive's  action or omission was in the best  interests  of the Company.  Any
act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive  Officer of
the  Company  or a senior  officer  of the  Company  or based upon the advice of
counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to
be  done,  by the  Executive  in good  faith  and in the best  interests  of the
Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be
for Cause unless and until there shall have been  delivered  to the  Executive a
copy of a  resolution  duly  adopted  by the  affirmative  vote of not less than
three-quarters  of the entire  membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such  purpose  (after  reasonable  notice is provided to the
Executive and the Executive is given an  opportunity,  together with counsel for
the  Executive,  to be heard before the Board),  finding that, in the good faith
opinion  of the Board,  the  Executive  is guilty of the  conduct  described  in
Section 4(b)(1) or 4(b)(2), and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

     (c) Good  Reason.  The  Executive's  employment  may be  terminated  by the
Executive for Good Reason or by the Executive  voluntarily  without Good Reason.
"Good Reason" means:

          (1) the assignment to the Executive of any duties  inconsistent in any
     respect with the Executive's  position (including status,  offices,  titles
     and  reporting  requirements),  authority,  duties or  responsibilities  as
     contemplated by Section 3(a)(1)(A), or any other action by the Company that
     results  in  a  diminution   in  such   position,   authority,   duties  or
     responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and
     inadvertent  action  not  taken in bad faith  and that is  remedied  by the
     Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;



          (2) any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of
     Section 3(b), other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure
     not  occurring  in bad faith and that is remedied  by the Company  promptly
     after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;

          (3) the  Company's  requiring  the  Executive  (i) to be  based at any
     office or location other than as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(B), (ii) to be
     based at a  location  other  than the  principal  executive  offices of the
     Company  if  the  Executive  was  employed  at  such  location  immediately
     preceding the Effective  Date, or (iii) to travel on Company  business to a
     substantially  greater  extent  than  required  immediately  prior  to  the
     Effective Date;

          (4)  any  purported  termination  by the  Company  of the  Executive's
     employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or

          (5) any  failure by the  Company to comply  with and  satisfy  Section
     10(c).

     For purposes of this Section  4(c),  any good faith  determination  of Good
Reason made by the Executive  shall be  conclusive.  The  Executive's  mental or
physical  incapacity  following the  occurrence of an event  described  above in
clauses (1) through (5) shall not affect the  Executive's  ability to  terminate
employment for Good Reason.

     (d) Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by
the Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to
the other party  hereto  given in  accordance  with  Section  11(b).  "Notice of
Termination" means a written notice that (1) indicates the specific  termination
provision in this  Agreement  relied upon,  (2) to the extent  applicable,  sets
forth in  reasonable  detail  the facts and  circumstances  claimed to provide a
basis for  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  under the  provision so
indicated,  and (3) if the Date of Termination (as defined herein) is other than
the date of receipt of such notice,  specifies  the Date of  Termination  (which
Date of  Termination  shall be not more than 30 days  after  the  giving of such
notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice
of Termination  any fact or circumstance  that  contributes to a showing of Good
Reason or Cause  shall not waive  any  right of the  Executive  or the  Company,
respectively,  hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively,
from asserting  such fact or  circumstance  in enforcing the  Executive's or the
Company's respective rights hereunder.

     (e) Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" means (1) if the Executive's
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause,  or by the Executive for Good
Reason,  the date of  receipt  of the  Notice of  Termination  or any later date
specified  in  the  Notice  of  Termination,  as the  case  may  be,  (2) if the
Executive's  employment  is  terminated  by the Company  other than for Cause or
Disability,  the Date of  Termination  shall be the  date on which  the  Company
notifies  the  Executive  of  such  termination,  and  (3)  if  the  Executive's
employment  is  terminated  by  reason  of  death  or  Disability,  the  Date of
Termination  shall  be the  date of death  of the  Executive  or the  Disability
Effective Date, as the case may be.

     Section 5.  Obligations of the Company upon  Termination.  (a) Good Reason;
Other Than for Cause, Death or Disability. If, during the Employment Period, the



Company terminates the Executive's employment other than for Cause or Disability
or the Executive terminates employment for Good Reason:

          (1) the  Company  shall  pay to the  Executive,  in a lump sum in cash
     within  30  days  after  the  Date of  Termination,  the  aggregate  of the
     following amounts:

               (A) the sum of (i) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the
          Date of  Termination,  (ii) the product of (x) the Recent Annual Bonus
          and (y) a fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the number of days in
          the  current  fiscal  year  through  the Date of  Termination  and the
          denominator  of which is 365, and (iii) any accrued  vacation  pay, in
          each case, to the extent not theretofore  paid (the sum of the amounts
          described   in   subclauses   (i),   (ii)  and  (iii),   the  "Accrued
          Obligations");

               (B) the amount  equal to the  product of (i) two and (ii) the sum
          of (x) the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary and (y) the Recent  Annual
          Bonus;

               (C) an amount equal to the excess of (i) the actuarial equivalent
          of  the  benefit  under  the  Company's   qualified   defined  benefit
          retirement  plan  (the   "Retirement   Plan")   (utilizing   actuarial
          assumptions  no less  favorable to the Executive  than those in effect
          under the Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date) and
          any  excess or  supplemental  retirement  plan in which the  Executive
          participates  (collectively,  the  "SERP")  that the  Executive  would
          receive if the  Executive's  employment  continued for two years after
          the  Date of  Termination,  assuming  for  this  purpose  that (x) the
          Executive's  age and  service  credit  increase  during  the  two-year
          period,  (y)  all  accrued  benefits  are  fully  vested  and  (z) the
          Executive's  compensation in each of the two years is that required by
          Sections  3(b)(1) and 3(b)(2),  over (ii) the actuarial  equivalent of
          the  Executive's  actual benefit (paid or payable),  if any, under the
          Retirement Plan and the SERP as of the Date of Termination; and

               (D) an amount  equal to the sum of the Company  matching or other
          Company   contributions   under  the   Company's   qualified   defined
          contribution plans and any excess or supplemental defined contribution
          plans in which the Executive  participates  that the  Executive  would
          receive if the  Executive's  employment  continued for two years after
          the  Date of  Termination,  assuming  for  this  purpose  that (x) the
          Executive's  benefits  under  such  plans  are fully  vested,  (y) the
          Executive's  compensation in each of the two years is that required by
          Sections  3(b)(1)  and  3(b)(2) and (z) to the extent that the Company
          contributions  are determined based on the  contributions or deferrals
          of the  Executive,  that  the  Executive's  contribution  or  deferral
          elections,  as appropriate,  are those in effect immediately prior the
          Date of Termination; and

               (2) for two years after the Executive's  Date of Termination,  or
          such longer period as may be provided by the terms of the  appropriate
          plan, program, practice or policy, the Company shall continue benefits
          to the Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those
          that would have been  provided to them in  accordance  with the plans,


          programs,  practices and policies  described in Section 3(b)(4) if the
          Executive's  employment had not been  terminated or, if more favorable
          to the Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time thereafter with
          respect to other peer  executives  of the Company  and the  Affiliated
          Companies  and  their  families,   provided,  however,  that,  if  the
          Executive becomes  reemployed with another employer and is eligible to
          receive such  benefits  under  another  employer  provided  plan,  the
          medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary
          to those provided under such other plan during such applicable  period
          of eligibility.  For purposes of determining  eligibility (but not the
          time  of  commencement  of  benefits)  of the  Executive  for  retiree
          benefits pursuant to such plans, practices, programs and policies, the
          Executive shall be considered to have remained  employed (for purposes
          of both age and  service  credit)  until two  years  after the Date of
          Termination and to have retired on the last day of such period;

               (3) during the 12-month period following the Date of Termination,
          the  Company  shall,  at its sole  expense as  incurred,  provide  the
          Executive with  outplacement  services the scope and provider of which
          shall be selected by the Executive in the Executive's sole discretion,
          provided that, the cost of such outplacement  shall not exceed $25,000
          (as  adjusted  for  inflation  based on the  Consumer  Price  Index or
          another nationally recognized published inflation index); and

               (4) to the extent not theretofore  paid or provided,  the Company
          shall  timely  pay or provide to the  Executive  any other  amounts or
          benefits  required  to be paid or provided  or that the  Executive  is
          eligible  to receive  under any plan,  program,  policy or practice or
          contract or  agreement  of the Company  and the  Affiliated  Companies
          (such other amounts and benefits, the "Other Benefits").

          (b) Death.  If the  Executive's  employment is terminated by reason of
     the  Executive's  death during the  Employment  Period,  the Company  shall
     provide  the  Executive's   estate  or   beneficiaries   with  the  Accrued
     Obligations and the timely payment or delivery of the Other  Benefits,  and
     shall have no other severance obligations under this Agreement. The Accrued
     Obligations  shall be paid to the  Executive's  estate or  beneficiary,  as
     applicable,  in a  lump  sum  in  cash  within  30  days  of  the  Date  of
     Termination.  With respect to the provision of the Other Benefits, the term
     "Other  Benefits" as utilized in this Section 5(b) shall  include,  without
     limitation,  and the  Executive's  estate  and/or  beneficiaries  shall  be
     entitled to receive, benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits
     provided  by the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies  to the estates and
     beneficiaries  of  peer  executives  of  the  Company  and  the  Affiliated
     Companies under such plans,  programs,  practices and policies  relating to
     death benefits,  if any, as in effect with respect to other peer executives
     and their  beneficiaries at any time during the 120-day period  immediately
     preceding  the  Effective  Date or, if more  favorable  to the  Executive's
     estate and/or the  Executive's  beneficiaries,  as in effect on the date of
     the Executive's  death with respect to other peer executives of the Company
     and the Affiliated Companies and their beneficiaries.

          (c) Disability.  If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason
     of the Executive's  Disability  during the Employment  Period,  the Company
     shall provide the  Executive  with the Accrued  Obligations  and the timely
     payment  or  delivery  of the  Other  Benefits,  and  shall  have no  other
     severance  obligations under this Agreement.  The Accrued Obligations shall



     be paid to the  Executive  in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date
     of Termination.  With respect to the provision of the Other  Benefits,  the
     term "Other  Benefits" as utilized in this Section 5(c) shall include,  and
     the Executive  shall be entitled  after the  Disability  Effective  Date to
     receive, disability and other benefits at least equal to the most favorable
     of those generally provided by the Company and the Affiliated  Companies to
     disabled  executives  and/or their families in accordance  with such plans,
     programs,  practices  and policies  relating to  disability,  if any, as in
     effect  generally with respect to other peer  executives and their families
     at any time during the 120-day period  immediately  preceding the Effective
     Date or, if more favorable to the Executive and/or the Executive's  family,
     as in effect at any time  thereafter  generally  with respect to other peer
     executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies and their families.

          (d) Cause;  Other Than for Good Reason. If the Executive's  employment
     is terminated  for Cause during the  Employment  Period,  the Company shall
     provide to the Executive (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the
     Date of  Termination,  (2) any  accrued  vacation  pay,  and (3) the  Other
     Benefits, in each case, to the extent theretofore unpaid, and shall have no
     other  severance  obligations  under  this  Agreement.   If  the  Executive
     voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a
     termination for Good Reason, the Company shall provide to the Executive the
     Accrued  Obligations  and the  timely  payment  or  delivery  of the  Other
     Benefits,  and  shall  have  no  other  severance  obligations  under  this
     Agreement.  In such case, all the Accrued  Obligations shall be paid to the
     Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.

          Section 6. Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Nothing in this Agreement shall
     prevent or limit the Executive's  continuing or future participation in any
     plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or the Affiliated
     Companies and for which the Executive may qualify,  nor, subject to Section
     11(f),  shall anything herein limit or otherwise  affect such rights as the
     Executive may have under any other  contract or agreement  with the Company
     or the Affiliated  Companies.  Amounts that are vested benefits or that the
     Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice
     or program of or any other  contract or  agreement  with the Company or the
     Affiliated  Companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination  shall be
     payable  in  accordance  with such  plan,  policy,  practice  or program or
     contract or  agreement,  except as explicitly  modified by this  Agreement.
     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if the  Executive  receives  payments and
     benefits  pursuant to Section 5(a) of this  Agreement,  the Executive shall
     not be entitled to any severance pay or benefits under any severance  plan,
     program  or policy of the  Company  and the  Affiliated  Companies,  unless
     otherwise  specifically  provided  therein by a specific  reference to this
     Agreement.

          Section  7. Full  Settlement.  The  Company's  obligation  to make the
     payments  provided  for in this  Agreement  and  otherwise  to perform  its
     obligations  hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off,  counterclaim,
     recoupment,  defense,  or other claim, right or action that the Company may
     have against the  Executive or others.  In no event shall the  Executive be
     obligated  to seek  other  employment  or take any  other  action by way of
     mitigation  of the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
     provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether
     or not the Executive obtains other employment. The Company agrees to pay as
     incurred,  to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses
     that  the  Executive  may  reasonably  incur  as a  result  of any  contest
     (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Executive or others



     of the validity or enforceability  of, or liability under, any provision of
     this  Agreement or any  guarantee of  performance  thereof  (including as a
     result of any  contest by the  Executive  about the  amount of any  payment
     pursuant to this  Agreement),  plus, in each case,  interest on any delayed
     payment  at  the   applicable   federal   rate   provided  for  in  Section
     7872(f)(2)(A)  of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of  1986,  as  amended  (the
     "Code").

          Section 8. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

          (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the
     event it shall  be  determined  that any  payment  or  distribution  by the
     Company or its Affiliated  Companies to or for the benefit of the Executive
     (whether paid or payable or  distributed or  distributable  pursuant to the
     terms of this Agreement or otherwise,  but determined without regard to any
     additional  payments  required under this Section 8) (a "Payment") would be
     subject  to the  excise  tax  imposed  by  Section  4999 of the Code or any
     interest or penalties  are incurred by the  Executive  with respect to such
     excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties,
     collectively  the "Excise  Tax"),  then the Executive  shall be entitled to
     receive an additional  payment (the  "Gross-Up  Payment") in an amount such
     that,  after payment by the Executive of all taxes  (including any interest
     or  penalties  imposed  with  respect to such  taxes),  including,  without
     limitation,  any income taxes (and any interest and penalties  imposed with
     respect  thereto)  and Excise Tax imposed upon the  Gross-Up  Payment,  the
     Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
     imposed upon the Payments.

          (b) Subject to the  provisions  of Section  8(c),  all  determinations
     required  to be made under this  Section 8,  including  whether  and when a
     Gross-Up  Payment is required,  the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the
     assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made
     by Ernst & Young, LLP, or such other nationally recognized certified public
     accounting  firm as may be  designated  by the  Executive,  subject  to the
     Company's approval which will not be unreasonably withheld (the "Accounting
     Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting  calculations
     both to the  Company  and the  Executive  within  15  business  days of the
     receipt of notice from the Executive  that there has been a Payment or such
     earlier  time  as is  requested  by the  Company.  In the  event  that  the
     Accounting  Firm is serving as  accountant  or auditor for the  individual,
     entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive,  subject to
     the Company's approval which will not be unreasonably withheld, may appoint
     another  nationally  recognized  accounting firm to make the determinations
     required  hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
     Accounting  Firm  hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
     shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment,  as determined
     pursuant to this  Section 8, shall be paid by the Company to the  Executive
     within 5 days of the receipt of the Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any
     determination  by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and
     the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section
     4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting
     Firm  hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments that will not have
     been made by the  Company  should  have  been  made  (the  "Underpayment"),
     consistent  with the  calculations  required to be made  hereunder.  In the
     event the Company  exhausts its  remedies  pursuant to Section 8(c) and the
     Executive  thereafter  is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the
     Accounting  Firm shall  determine the amount of the  Underpayment  that has
     occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to
     or for the benefit of the Executive.



          (c) The Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by
     the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
     by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as
     soon as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after the Executive
     is informed  in writing of such  claim.  The  Executive  shall  apprise the
     Company  of the  nature of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is
     requested to be paid.  The Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the
     expiration of the 30-day  period  following the date on which the Executive
     gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date
     that any  payment  of taxes  with  respect  to such  claim is due).  If the
     Company  notifies the Executive in writing prior to the  expiration of such
     period that the Company desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

          (1) give the  Company  any  information  reasonably  requested  by the
     Company relating to such claim,

          (2) take such action in connection  with  contesting such claim as the
     Company shall reasonably  request in writing from time to time,  including,
     without  limitation,  accepting legal  representation  with respect to such
     claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

          (3) cooperate  with the Company in good faith in order  effectively to
     contest such claim, and

          (4) permit the Company to participate in any  proceedings  relating to
     such claim;

     provided,  however,  that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs
and  expenses   (including   additional  interest  and  penalties)  incurred  in
connection  with  such  contest,  and  shall  indemnify  and hold the  Executive
harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  for any Excise Tax or income tax  (including
interest and penalties)  imposed as a result of such  representation and payment
of costs and expenses.  Without  limitation on the foregoing  provisions of this
Section 8(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with
such  contest,  and,  at its sole  discretion,  may  pursue or forgo any and all
administrative   appeals,   proceedings,   hearings  and  conferences  with  the
applicable  taxing  authority  in  respect  of such  claim and may,  at its sole
discretion,  either pay the tax claimed to the appropriate  taxing  authority on
behalf of the  Executive and direct the Executive to sue for a refund or contest
the claim in any permissible  manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided,  however, that, if the Company pays such claim and directs
the  Executive to sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  indemnify  and hold the
Executive  harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties)  imposed with respect to such payment or with
respect to any imputed  income in connection  with such  payment;  and provided,
further, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of
taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
amount  is  claimed  to be due is  limited  solely  to  such  contested  amount.
Furthermore,  the  Company's  control of the contest  shall be limited to issues
with respect to which the Gross-Up Payment would be payable  hereunder,  and the
Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.



     (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of a Gross-Up Payment or payment
by the Company of an amount on the Executive's  behalf pursuant to Section 8(c),
the Executive  becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to the Excise
Tax to which such Gross-Up  Payment  relates or with respect to such claim,  the
Executive  shall (subject to the Company's  complying with the  requirements  of
Section  8(c),  if  applicable)  promptly  pay to the Company the amount of such
refund  (together  with  any  interest  paid or  credited  thereon  after  taxes
applicable  thereto).  If,  after  payment  by the  Company  of an amount on the
Executive's  behalf pursuant to Section 8(c), a  determination  is made that the
Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the
Company  does not notify the  Executive in writing of its intent to contest such
denial of refund prior to the  expiration  of 30 days after such  determination,
then the amount of such payment shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount
of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8, the Company may,
in its sole discretion,  withhold and pay to the Internal Revenue Service or any
other applicable taxing authority,  for the benefit of the Executive, all or any
portion of any  Gross-Up  Payment,  and the  Executive  hereby  consents to such
withholding.

     Section  9.  Confidential  Information.  The  Executive  shall  hold  in  a
fiduciary  capacity  for the benefit of the  Company all secret or  confidential
information,  knowledge  or  data  relating  to the  Company  or the  Affiliated
Companies, and their respective businesses, which information, knowledge or data
shall have been obtained by the Executive  during the Executive's  employment by
the Company or the Affiliated Companies and which information, knowledge or data
shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or
representatives  of  the  Executive  in  violation  of  this  Agreement).  After
termination of the Executive's  employment with the Company, the Executive shall
not,  without the prior  written  consent of the Company or as may  otherwise be
required by law or legal process,  communicate or divulge any such  information,
knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those persons  designated
by the Company.  In no event shall an asserted  violation of the  provisions  of
this  Section 9  constitute a basis for  deferring  or  withholding  any amounts
otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

     Section 10.  Successors.  (a) This  Agreement is personal to the Executive,
and,  without the prior written consent of the Company,  shall not be assignable
by the  Executive  other than by will or the laws of descent  and  distribution.
This  Agreement  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of and  be  enforceable  by the
Executive's legal representatives.

     (b) This  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and be binding  upon the
Company and its  successors  and assigns.  Except as provided in Section  10(c),
without the prior written consent of the Executive,  this Agreement shall not be
assignable by the Company.

     (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect,  by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business  and/or assets of the Company to assume  expressly and agree to perform
this  Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would


be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. "Company" means
the Company as  hereinbefore  defined and any  successor to its business  and/or
assets as  aforesaid  that  assumes  and agrees to  perform  this  Agreement  by
operation of law or otherwise.

     Section  11.  Miscellaneous.  (a) This  Agreement  shall be governed by and
construed  in  accordance  with  the  laws of the  State  of  Delaware,  without
reference to principles of conflict of laws.  The captions of this Agreement are
not part of the  provisions  hereof  and  shall  have no force or  effect.  This
Agreement  may not be amended  or  modified  other  than by a written  agreement
executed  by the  parties  hereto  or  their  respective  successors  and  legal
representatives.

     (b) All notices and other communications  hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

          if to the Executive:  At the  most  recent  address  on file in the

or to such other  address as either  party shall have  furnished to the other in
writing in accordance  herewith.  Notice and  communications  shall be effective
when actually received by the addressee.

     (c) The invalidity or  unenforceability  of any provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other provision of this
Agreement.

     (d) The Company may withhold from any amounts  payable under this Agreement
such United States federal, state or local or foreign taxes as shall be required
to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

     (e)  The  Executive's  or the  Company's  failure  to  insist  upon  strict
compliance  with any  provision  of this  Agreement or the failure to assert any
right the  Executive  or the  Company  may have  hereunder,  including,  without
limitation,  the right of the Executive to terminate  employment for Good Reason
pursuant to Sections 4(c)(1) through 4(c)(5), shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.

     (f) The Executive and the Company acknowledge that, except as may otherwise
be provided  under any other  written  agreement  between the  Executive and the
Company,  the  employment  of the  Executive  by the  Company  is "at will" and,
subject to Section 1(a), prior to the Effective Date, the Executive's employment
may be  terminated  by either the  Executive or the Company at any time prior to
the Effective  Date, in which case the  Executive  shall have no further  rights
under this Agreement.  From and after the Effective Date, except as specifically
provided herein,  this Agreement shall supersede any other agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.






IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Executive has hereunto set the  Executive's  hand and,
pursuant to the  authorization  from the Board,  the  Company  has caused  these
presents to be  executed  in its name on its behalf,  all as of the day and year
first above written.

                    SCHEDULE OF CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS

The following have executed Change of Control  Agreements  substantially  in the
form of the agreement  attached as Exhibit 10.9 to the Valero Energy Corporation

                                                                    Exhibit 12.1

                   VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
         STATEMENTs OF COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
                      (Millions of Dollars, Except Ratios)



(1)  The interest portion of rental expense represents one-third of rents, which
     is deemed representative of the interest portion of rental expense.
(2)  Valero paid no dividends on preferred  stock with respect to its continuing
     operations during the periods indicated;  therefore,  the ratio of earnings
     to combined fixed charges and preferred  stock dividends is the same as the
     ratio of earnings to fixed charges.
(3)  For the year ended December 31, 1998,  earnings were  insufficient to cover
     fixed  charges by $77.7  million.  This  deficiency  was due primarily to a
     $170.9  million  pre-tax  charge to net income to write  down the  carrying
     amount of Valero's inventories to market value. Excluding the effect of the
     inventory  write-down,  the ratio of earnings to fixed  charges  would have
     been 2.7x.




                                                                    EXHIBIT 21.1

                   Valero Energy Corporation and Subsidiaries




*    Valero owns about 49%.






                                                                    EXHIBIT 23.1

                         Consent of Independent Auditors

We consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements,  as
amended,  on Form S-3  (Registration  No.  333-84820) and Form S-8 (Registration
Nos. 333-31709,  333-31721,  333-31723,  333-31727, 333-81844 and 333-81858), of
our report dated March 19,  2003,  with  respect to the  consolidated  financial
statements  of Valero  Energy  Corporation  included in this Annual Report (Form
10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2002.
