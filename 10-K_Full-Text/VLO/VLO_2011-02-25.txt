Corpus Christi East and West Refineries

. Our Corpus Christi East and West Refineries are located on the Texas Gulf Coast along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. The West Refinery specializes in processing primarily sour crude oil and residual fuel oil into premium products such as RBOB. The East Refinery processes sour crude oil into conventional gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, aromatics, and other light products. The East and West Refineries are substantially integrated allowing for the trans
fer of various feedstocks and blending components between the two refineries and the sharing of resources. The refineries typically receive and deliver feedstocks and products by tanker and barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. Three truck racks with a total of 16 bays service local markets for gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, liquefied petroleum gases, and asphalt. Finished products are distributed across the refinery docks into ships or barges, and are transported via third-party pipelines to the Colonial, Explorer, Valley, and other major pipelines.

Port Arthur Refinery

. Our Port Arthur Refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast app
roximately 90 miles east of Houston. The refinery processes primarily heavy sour crude oils and other feedstocks into gasoline blendstocks, as well as diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, petroleum coke, and sulfur. The refinery receives crude oil over marine docks and through crude oil pipelines, and has access to the Sunoco and Oiltanking terminals at Nederland, Texas. Finished products are distributed into the Colonial, Explorer, and TEPPCO pipelines and across the refinery docks into ships or barges.

St. Charles Refinery

. Our St. Charles Refinery is located approximately 15 miles from New Orleans along the Mississippi River. The refinery processes sour crude oils and oth
er feedstocks into gasoline, distillates, and other light products. The refinery receives crude oil over five marine docks and has access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port where it can receive crude oil through a 24-inch pipeline. Finished products can be shipped over these docks or through the Colonial pipeline network for distribution to the eastern U.S.

Texas City Refinery

. Our Texas City Refinery is located southeast of Houston on the Texas City Ship Channel. The refinery processes sour crude oils into a wide slate of products. The refinery receives and delivers its feedstocks and products by ship and barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Texas City Ship Channe
l and uses the Colonial, Explorer, and TEPPCO pipelines for distribution of its products.

Aruba Refinery

. Our Aruba Refinery is located on the island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea. It processes primarily heavy sour crude oil and produces intermediate feedstocks and finished distillate products. Significant amounts of the refinery's intermediate feedstock production are transported and further processed in our other refineries in the Gulf Coast and West Coast regions. The refinery receives crude oil by ship at its two deepwater marine docks, which can berth ultra-large crude carriers. The refinery's products are delivered by ship primarily into markets in the U.S., the Caribbea
n, Europe, and South America.

Houston Refinery

. Our Houston Refinery is located on the Houston Ship Channel. It processes a mix of crude oils and low-sulfur residual fuel oil into reformulated gasoline and distillates. The refinery receives its feedstocks via tanker at deepwater docking facilities along the Houston Ship Channel and interconnecting pipelines with the Texas City Refinery. It delivers its products through major refined-product pipelines, including the Colonial, Explorer, Orion, and TEPPCO pipelines.

December 31, 2010

.

Memphis Refinery

. Our Memphis Refinery is located in Tennessee along the Mississippi River's Lake McKellar. It processes primarily sweet crude oils. Most of its production is light products, including regular and premium gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, and petrochemicals. 
Crude oil is supplied to the refinery via the Capline pipeline and can also be received, along with other feedstocks, via barge. The refinery's products are distributed via truck racks at our three product terminals, barges, and a pipeline network, including one pipeline directly to the Memphis airport.

McKee Refinery

. Our McKee Refinery is located in the Texas Panhandle. It processes primarily sweet crude oils into conventional gasoline, RBOB, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, and asphalt. The refinery has access to crude oil from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado through third-party pipelines. The refinery also has access at Wichita Falls, Texas to third-party pipelines that
 transport crude oil from the Texas Gulf Coast and West Texas to the Mid-Continent region. The refinery distributes its products primarily via NuStar Energy L.P.'s pipelines to markets in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Oklahoma.

Ardmore Refinery

. Our Ardmore Refinery is located in Ardmore, Oklahoma, approximately 100 miles south of Oklahoma City. It processes medium sour and sweet crude oils into conventional gasoline, ultra-low-sulfur diesel, liquefied petroleum gas products, and asphalt. Local crude oil is gathered by TEPPCO's crude oil gathering/trunkline systems and trucking operations, and then transported to the refinery through third-party crude oil
 pipelines. Foreign, mid-continent, and other domestic crude oils are received via third-party pipelines. Refined products are transported to market via railcars, trucks, and the Magellan pipeline system.



Northeast

The following table presents the percentages of principal charges and yields for the Quebec City Refinery for the year ended

December 31, 2010

. Total throughput volumes for the Northeast refining region averaged approximately 195,000 BPD for the year ended

December 31, 2010

.

<
/div>

Quebec City Refinery

. Our Quebec City Refinery is located in Lévis, Canada (near Quebec City). It processes sweet, high mercaptan crude oils and lower-quality, sweet acidic crude oils into conventional gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, jet fuels, heating oil, and propane. The refinery receives crude oil by ship at its deepwater dock on the St. Lawrence River. We charter large ice-strengthened, double-hulled crude oil tankers that can nav
igate the St. Lawrence River year-round. The refinery transports its products to its terminals in Quebec and Ontario primarily by train, and also uses ships and trucks extensively throughout eastern Canada.

Feedstock Supply

Approximately 58 percent of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market. Our term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstoc
ks at market-related prices directly or indirectly from various foreign national oil companies (including feedstocks originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Mexico, and South America) as well as international and domestic oil companies. The contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate them), effective as of the next scheduled renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time (

e.g

., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of the current term. The majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer’s official stated price (

i.e

., the “market” price established by the seller for all purchasers) and not at a nego
tiated price specific to us. About 78 percent of our crude oil feedstocks under term supply agreements are imported from foreign sources and about 22 percent are domestic. If we become unable to purchase crude oil from any one of these sources, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available.

The U.S. network of crude oil pipelines and terminals allows us to acquire crude oil from producing leases, domestic crude oil trading centers, and ships delivering cargoes of foreign and domestic crude oil. Our Quebec City and Aruba Refineries rely on foreign crude oil that is delivered to the refineries’ dock facilities by ship. We use the futures market to manage a portion of the price risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in adva
nce of the delivery date and holding inventories of crude oils and refined products.



Refining Segment Sales

Our refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets. These sales include refined products that are manufactured in our refining operations as well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of our refineries have access to marine transportation facilities and interconnect with common-carrier pipeline systems, allowing us to sell products in most major geographic regions of the U.S. and eastern Canada. No customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total operating revenues in 2010.

Wholesale Marketing

We market branded and unbranded transportation fuels on a wholesale basis in 44 states through an extensive rack marketing network. The principal purchasers of our transportation fuels from terminal truck racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and truck-delivered end users throughout the U.S..

The majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero-brand family that operate approximately 4,000 branded sites. These sites are indepen
dently owned and are supplied by us under multi-year contracts.  For wholesale branded sites, we promote our Valero

®

brand throughout the U.S. In addition, we offer the Beacon

®

brand in California and the Shamrock

®

brand elsewhere in the U.S.

Bulk Sales and Trading

We sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels in domestic and international markets. Our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain bulk end-users such as railroads, airlines, and utilities. Our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline, barges, and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs.

We also enter into refined product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements help to minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined product availability
, broaden geographic distribution, and provide access to markets not connected to our refined product pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and third parties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations.

Specialty Products

We sell a variety of other pr
oducts produced at our refineries, which we refer to collectively as “Specialty Products.” Our Specialty Products include asphalt, lube oils, natural gas liquids (NGLs), petroleum coke, petrochemicals, and sulfur.

•

We produce asphalt at five of our refineries. Our asphalt products are sold for use in road construction, road repair, and roofing applications through a network of refinery and terminal loading racks.

•

We produce napthenic oils at one of our refineries suitable for a wide variety of lubricant and process applications.

•

NGLs produced at our refineries include butane, isobutane, and propane. These products can b
e used for gasoline blending, home heating, and petrochemical plant feedstocks.

•

We are a significant producer of petroleum coke, supplying primarily power generation customers and cement manufacturers. Petroleum coke is used largely as a substitute for coal.



•

We produce and market a number of commodity petrochemicals including aromatic solvents (benzene, toluene, and xylene) and two grades of propylene. Aromatic solvents and propylenes are sold to customers in the chemical industry for further processing into such products as paints, plastics, and adhesives.

•

We are a large producer of sulfur with sales primarily to customers in the agricultural sector. Sulfur is used in manufacturing fertilizer.



ETHANOL

We own 10 ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of about 1.1
 billion gallons per year. Our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities


that process corn to produce ethanol and distillers grains.


We source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators. Our facilities receive corn by rail and truck. On our website, we publish a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to use to facilitate corn supply transactions.

After processing, our ethanol is held in storage tanks on-site pending loading to trucks and railcars. We sell our ethanol (i) to large customers – primarily refiners and gasoline blenders – under term and spot contracts, and (ii) in bulk markets such as New York, Chicago, Dallas, Florida, and the West Coast. We also use our ethanol for our own needs in blending gasoline. We ship our dry distillers grains (DDG) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the U.S. and Mexico, with some sales into the Far East. We also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites.

The following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants, their approximate ethanol and DDG production capacit
ies, and their approximate corn processing capacities.

Ethanol production from our 10 plants in the fourth quarter of 2010 averaged 3.25 million gallons per day. We acquired our Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota plants in the second quarter of 2009. We acquired our Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin plants in the first quarter of 2010. For additional information regarding these acquisitions, see

Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

________________________


Ethanol is commercially produced using either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains.

;


During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are concentrated to yield modified distillers grains, or, after further drying, dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial replacement for corn, soybean, and dicalcium phosphate in feeds for livestock, swine, and poultry.



RETAIL

Our retail segment operations include the following:

•

sales of transportation fuels at retail stores and unattended self-service cardlocks,

•

sales of convenience store merchandise and 
services in retail stores, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

We are one of the largest independent retailers of refined products in the central and southwest U.S. and eastern Canada. Our retail operations are segregated geographically into two groups: Retail-U.S
. and Retail-Canada.

Retail-U.S.

Sales in Retail-U.S. represent sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise and services through our company-operated retail sites. For the year ended

December 31, 2010

, total sales of refined products through Retail-U.S.’s retail sites averaged approximately 119,900 BPD. In addition to transportation fuels, our company-operated convenience stores sell tobacco products, beer, fast food
s and sandwiches, snacks, fountain drinks, bagged ice, and candy.  Our stores also offer services such as ATM access, money orders, lottery tickets, car wash facilities, air and water, and video rentals. On

December 31, 2010

, we had 994 company-operated sites in Retail-U.S. (of which 80 percent were owned and 20 percent were leased). Our company-operated stores are operated primarily under the Corner Store

®

brand name. Transportation fuels sold in our Retail-U.S. stores are sold primarily under the Valero

®

brand.

Retail-Canada

Sales in Retail-Canada include the following:

•

sales of refined products and convenience store merchandise th
rough our company-operated retail sites and cardlocks,

•

sales of refined products through sites owned by independent dealers and jobbers, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

Retail-Canada includes retail operations in eastern Canada where we are a major supplier of refined products serving Quebec, Ontario, and the Atlantic Provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. For the year ended

December 31, 2010

, total retail sales of refined products through Retail-Canada averaged approximately 75,400 BPD. Transportation fuels are sold under the Ultramar

®

brand through a network of 812 outlets throughout eastern Canada. On

December 31, 2010

, we owned or leased 392 retail stores in Retail-Canada and distributed gasoline to 420 dealers and independent jobbers. In addition, Retail-Canada operates 83 cardlocks, which are card- or key-activated, self-service, unattended stations that allow commercial, trucking, and governmental fleets to buy transportation fuel 24 hours a day. Retail-Canada operations also include a large home heating oil business that provides home heating oil to approximately 138,000 households in eastern Canada. Our home heating oil business tends to be seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter.



RISK FACTORS

Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins and global economic activity.

Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of domestic and foreign sup
pliers, levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future.

Continued economic turmoil and hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the U.S. and other countries. Lower levels of economic activity during periods of recession could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospect
s.

Refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. Worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability far exceeding refined product demand, which would have a significant adverse effect on refining margins.

A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchm
ark crude oils, such as West Texas Intermediate and Louisiana Light Sweet crude oils. These crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our earnings.

Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.

Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.

We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. (Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.) We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Specifically, if S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase,



which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade below investment g
rade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position.

From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fun
d their commitments to us under our various financing facilities. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our financing facilities to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.

Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance.

The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater.&nb
sp; Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels.  If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned.  Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future.  In particular, current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial actions, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased cost
s of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.  Our refining processes produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide and the fuels we manufacture are the primary source of carbon dioxide emitted from transportation activities. Federal and state restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions - including so-called “cap-and-trade” programs targeted at reducing carbon dioxide emissions - could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Disruption of 
our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations

.

A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could
 be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.



In addition, the U.S. government can
 prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with foreign countries. These restrictions, and those of foreign governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the U.S. and foreign countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage

.

The refining and marketing industry is highly co
mpetitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.

Some of our competitor
s also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.

Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries w
ere to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.

We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses arising from operating hazards. Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results, and financial condition

.

Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and ded
uctibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. We are not currently aware of any information that would 
indicate that any of our insurers is



unlikely to perform in the event of a covered incident. However, in light of this uncertainty and the risk of a volatile financial market, we c
an make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events.

Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including U.S., state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabiliti
es are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.

Environmental Enforcement Matters

While it is not 
possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on our financial position or results of operations. We are reporting these proceedings to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

(mobile source enforcement).  In November 201
0, the EPA issued a letter to us formalizing a proposed penalty of $585,000 in connection with eight alleged violations of federal fuels regulations (most of which were self-reported) purportedly occurring from March 2004 to 2006 at various refineries and terminals.  We are negotiating with the EPA to resolve this matter.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)

(Benicia Refinery). In the fourth quarter of 2010, we settled 22 violation notices (VN’s) with the BAAQMD that were issued in 2006 and 2007.  We presently have outstanding 78 VN’s issued by the BAAQMD from 2008 to 2010 for various alleged air regulation and air permit violations at our Benicia Refinery and asphalt 
plant. No penalties have been specified in these VN’s. We are pursuing settlement of all VN’s.

New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)

(Paulsboro Refinery).  We previously disclosed certain outstanding proceedings between the NJDEP and the Paulsboro Refinery in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009; our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010; and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  Most of these proceedings were resolved in the first quarter of 2011 through a negotiated settlement with the NJDEP.  The other proceedings were resolved with entry of Administrative Compliance
 Orders in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2010.

People of the State of Illinois, ex rel. v. The Premcor Refining Group Inc., et al.

, Third Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County (Case No. 03-CH-00459, filed May 29, 2003) (Hartford Refinery and terminal). The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has issued several notices of violation alleging violations of air and waste regulations at Premcor’s Hartford, Illinois terminal and closed refinery. We are negotiating the terms of a consent order for corrective action.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality

(TCEQ)

(Corpus Christi East Refinery). In October 2010, we received a proposed agreed order from the TCEQ relating to unauthorized air emissions during a flaring event and excess air emissions from three plant boilers at our Corpus Christi East Refinery.  The gross penalty demand was stated to be more than $100,000, but following our discussions with the TCEQ to clarify certain issues under question, we reasonably believe that the ultimate penalty amount for this matter will fall below $100,000.



TCEQ

(Corpus Christi West Refinery and Texas City Refinery). In the second quarter of 2009, the TCEQ issued a notice of enforcement (NOE) to our Corpus Christi West Refinery. The NOE alleged excess air emissions relating to two cooling tower leaks that occurred in 2008. The penalty demanded in t
he TCEQ’s Preliminary Report and Petition was $1,100,424.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, the TCEQ issued a proposed agreed order with a combined penalty of $591,858 pertaining to alleged cooling tower emissions at our Corpus Christi West Refinery and alleged flaring emissions at our Texas City Refinery.  We are negotiating with the TCEQ to resolve this matter.

TCEQ

(Three Rivers Refinery).   In January 2011, we received a proposed agreed order from the TCEQ relating to our Three Rivers Refinery.  In the order, the TCEQ alleges unauthorized discharge of wastewater and oily storm water and the unauthorized storage of industrial solid waste.  The gross penalty demand is stated to be $105,9
25, but is subject to reduction to $84,740 under certain circumstances.  We are in discussions with the TCEQ to resolve this matter.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

We reported income from continuing operations of

$923 million

, or

$1.62

per share, for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to a loss from continuing operations of

$273 million

, or

$0.50

per share, for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. These results were primarily due to our refining segment operations, which generated operating income of

$1.9 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to operating income of

$247 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. The increase in refining operating income was primarily due to improved margins for the distillate products we produce and wider sour crude
 oil differentials. The sour crude oil differential is the difference between the price of sweet crude oil and the price of sour crude oil. We believe that the improved distillate margins are due to an increase in the demand for refined products resulting from the improving U.S. and worldwide economies. Although improving, refined product demand has not returned to levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. Excess worldwide refinery capacity and high levels of refined product inventories continue to constrain refined product margins.

In response to the worldwide economic slowdown, and as a result of our assessment of the operating performance and profitability of our refineries, we temporarily shut down our Aruba Refinery in July 2009 and p
ermanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery in November 2009. In June 2010, we sold our shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets for $220 million of cash proceeds, and in December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and associated inventory for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one-year note. Our Aruba Refinery remained idle throughout 2010, but in the third quarter of 2010, we began refinery-wide maintenance to prepare the refinery’s production units for restart due to improved sour crude oil differentials and a general improvement in refining economics. The Aruba Refinery resumed operations in January 2011.

Our retail segment generated operating income of

$346 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to operating income of

$293 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. The 2010 results benefited from the blending of ethanol into gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost results in an increase in retail fuel margins.  During  the latter part of 2010, the difference between the cost of gasoline and the cost of et
hanol began to narrow and the benefit that our retail segment experienced through most of 2010 from the blending of ethanol into gasoline narrowed.  Should this trend continue in 2011, our retail fuel margins may be negatively impacted as compared to 2010.

In the second quarter of 2009, we entered the ethanol business through the acquisition of seven ethanol facilities, and we acquired three additional facilities in the first quarter of 2010. We believe that ethanol is a natural fit for us because we manufacture transportation fuels. During the year ended

December 31, 2010

, our ethanol segment generated operating in
come of

$209 million

, compared to

$165 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. The ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and can be impacted by U.S. government subsidies and biofuels (including ethanol) mandates.

To support our financial strength and liquidity, we issued $1.25 b
illion in debt during the first quarter of 2010 at interest rates favorable to those on our existing debt. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $484 million of debt with a higher interest rate, and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. In December 2010, we received proceeds of $300 million under a financing agreement associated with the issuance of $300 million of Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds (GO Zone Bonds). In February 2011, we paid $300 million to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which we expect to hold and reissue in future years to help fund the construction costs of a capital project at our St. Charles Refinery.

&
nbsp;



We expect the U.S. and worldwide economies to continue to recover slowly, and we expect refined product demand to increase. The increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production, which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils and continued improvement in sour crude oil differentials. The expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil
 production should favorably impact our refined product margins. However, we expect that the current excess global refining capacity will put pressure on refining margins and could result in ongoing production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry. We will continue to optimize our refining assets based on market conditions.

The following notes relate to references on pages 27 through 31.

(a)

On December 17, 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and associated inventory to PBF Holding Company LLC (PBF Holding) for $547 million of cash proceeds and a

$160 million

one-year note, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the sale of

$980 million

(

$610 million

after taxes). The results of operations of the refinery, including the loss on the sale, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.

(b)

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the shutdown of

$1.9 billion

(

$1.2 billion

after taxes). On June 
1, 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP (PBF) for

$220 million

of cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of the refinery assets of

$92 million

(

$58 million

after taxes) and an insignificant gain on the sale of the terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The ref
ining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. The terminal and pipeline assets associated with the refinery were not shut down in 2009 and continued to be operated until they were sold; the results of these operations are reflected in continuing operations for both years presented.

(c)

We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010 and seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented includes the results of operations of those plants comme
ncing on their respective acquisition or closing dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.

(d)

Credit card transactions processing fees incurred by our retail segment of

$76 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

have been reclassified from retail operating expenses to cost of sales. The Retail–U.S. and Retail–Canada operating highlights



have been restated to reflect this reclassification.

(e)

The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.

(f)

Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes.

(g)

Other produc
ts primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.

(h)

The refining regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City Refinery; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilm
ington Refineries.

(i)

A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the Government of Aruba (GOA) regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales during the year ended

December 31, 2009

, and therefore
 is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel.

General

Operating revenues increased

27 percent

(or $17.6 billion) for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2009

primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years. Operating income increased

$1.8 billion

and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to the amounts reported for the year ended

December 31, 2009

,  primarily due to a

$1.7 billion

increase in refining segment operating income discussed below.

Refining

Operating income for our refining segment increased from

$247 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

to

$1.9 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of

$1.3 billion

(discussed below), reduced asset impairment losses of

$218 million

, and the nonrecurrence of a

$114 million

loss contingency accrual in 2009. The asset impairment loss recorded in 2009 related to our decision to p
ermanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. We continue to evaluate our ongoing construction projects, but the number and significance of projects cancelled has substantially declined in 2010. The loss contingency accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba.

The

$1.3 billion

improvement in operating results was primarily due to a

30 percent

increa
se in throughput margin per barrel (an overall

$1.80

per barrel increase between the comparable years). The increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical (primarily propylene) margins, but those improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below.

Changes in the margin that we receive for our products have a material impact on our resul
ts of operations. For example, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which is a type of distillate, was

$11.14

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to

$8.02

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing a favorable increase of

$3.12

per barrel. Similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions. We estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an $820 million positive impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced

712,000

barrels per day of distillates during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. Similarly, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast propylene was

$7.92

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to a negative margin of

$1.31

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing a favorable increase of

$9.23

per barrel. We estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals (primarily propylene) had a $199 million positive impact on our refining margin, year over year. Distillate and propylene margins



were higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the U.S. and worldwide economies and exports.

The benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast Conventional 87 gasoline (Gulf Coast 87 gasoline) was

$7.51

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to

$7.61

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing an unfavorable decrease of

$0.10

per barrel. CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the West Coast region (a

$1.87

per barrel unfavorable decrease). We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a $119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced

1.05 million

barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2010. Gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010. We believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued 
weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory. In addition, our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline.

For the year ended

December 31, 2010

, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type
 of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of

$9.13

per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This compares to a discount of

$5.19

per barrel during the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing a favorable increase of

$3.94

per barrel. The benefit of this wider differential, however, was offset by a reduction of 30,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009. We estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, had a $196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed

844,000

barrels per day of sour crude oils.

Retail

Retail operating income wa
s

$346 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to

$293 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. This

18 percent

(or

$53 million

) increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of $57 million and merchandise margins of $27 million, partially offset by a

$28 million

increase in operating expenses.

Retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price for a gallon of ethanol was $0.23 less than a gallon of Gulf Coast 87 gasoline for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. We estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a $32 million positive impact to our U.S. retail fuel margins for


as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended

December 31, 2010

contained 10 percent ethanol. Retail fuel margins in our Canadian retail op
erations increased by $27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $0.96 during 2010 compared to $0.88 in 2009, representing an increase in value of nine percent.

Retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix, and a favorable impact from the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009, as described above.



The increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar had a $21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2009.

Ethanol

Ethanol operating income was

$209 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, compared to

$165 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. This increase of

$44 million

was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010, as described in

Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General 
and administrative expenses decreased

$41 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2009

primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which offset an increase in litigation costs of $40 million recorded in 2009. After adjusting for these items, the $40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of $21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of $18 million for environmental remed
iation expenses.

“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased

$89 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2009

due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) in November 2010 and the effect of a $42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into
 in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008.

Interest and debt expense increased $68 million from the year ended

December 31, 2009

to the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This increase is composed of a $53 million increase in interest incurred on $1.25 billion of debt issued in February 2010 and $1.0 billion of debt issued in March 2009 (see

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a

$15 million

decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects. We do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume. We anticipate that significant construction activities will resume on certain construction projects in 2011.

Income tax expense increased

$618 million

from a

$43 million

benefit in


to

$575 million

of expense in


mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010.

“Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” decreased

$1.1 billion

from the year ended

December 31, 2009

to the year ended

December 31, 2010

due to the after-tax loss of

$1.2 billion

related to the permanent shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results of operations for the Pauls
boro and Delaware City Refineries, including the loss and gain, respectively, on their sales, are reflected in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” as discussed in

The following notes relate to references on pages 35 through 39.

(a)

On December 17, 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and associated inventory to PBF Holding. The results of operations of the refinery have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.

(b)

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre-tax
 loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented.

(c)

We acquired seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented for 2009 includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective closing dates
. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during 2009 divided by actual calender days in 2009.

(d)

Credit card transactions processing fees incurred by our retail segment of

$76 million

and

$92 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2009

and


, respectively, have been reclassified from retail operating expenses to cost of sales. The Retail–U.S. and Retail–Canada operating highlights have been restated to reflect this reclassification.

(e)

The asset impairment loss relates primarily to
 the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.

(f)

On July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon). The nature and significance of our 
post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations. In addition, all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast



region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2008. The pre-tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per-barrel operating highlights.

(g)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determ
ined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008.

(h)

Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throu
ghput volumes.

(i)

Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.

(j)

The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale on July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City Refinery and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.

(k)

A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the GOA regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel.

General

Operating revenues decreased 39 percent (or

$42.1 billion

) for the year ended

December 31, 2009

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2008

. Operating income decreased by

$448 million

and income from continuing operations before taxes decreased by

$600 million

over the same period. These decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the U.S. and worldwide 
economic slowdown on the demand and prices for our refined products. The economic slowdown began in late 2008 and persisted throughout 2009. The decreases in operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes, however, were significantly affected by the

$4.0 billion

goodwill impairment loss and the

$305 million

gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery that we recorded in 2008. Excluding these two items, operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, from the prior year. These decreases were primarily related to our refining segment, which experienced a $518 million decrea
se in operating income in 2009 compared to 2008 (a

$4.3 billion

decrease after excluding the effect of the goodwill write-off and other items) as discussed below.

Refining

Operating income for our refining segment decreased from

$765 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2008

to

$247 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, due to a decrease in operating results of

$4.3 billion

(discussed below), a reduced goodwill impairment loss of

$4.0 billion

, an increased asset impairment loss of

$134 million

, and an increased loss contingency accrual of

$114 million

. The goodwill impairment loss related to our determination in 2008 that our goodwill was impaired, which was based on the significant decline in our equity market capitalization.  That decline was caused by severe disruptions in the U.S. and worldwide capital and commodities markets in 2008 and the resulting economic slowdown. The asset impairment loss of

$220 million

and

$86 million

reported in


and


, respectively, related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. The loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba.

The

$4.3 billion

decrease in operating results was primarily due to a 46 perc
ent decrease in throughput margin per barrel (a

$5.16

per barrel decrease between the comparable years) and an 8 percent decrease in throughput volumes (an

186,000

barrel per day decrease between the comparable years). The decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the economic slowdown on the demand for and prices of refined products. The decrease in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant decrease in distillate margins, but



the decrease in distillate margins was somewhat offset by an increase in gasoline margins in all of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel was also negatively impacted by narrow sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below.

<
/font>

Changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was

$8.02

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, compared to

$22.96

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2008

, representing an unfavorable decrease of

$14.94

per barrel. We experienced similar decreases in distillate margins in other regions. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins negatively impacted our overall refining margin by $4.4 billion, as we produced

692,000

barrels per day of distillates during the year ended

December 31, 2009

.

The benchmark reference margin for Gulf Coast 87 gasoline was

$7.61

per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to

$4.85

per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a favorable increase of $2.76 per barrel.  CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins increased year over year to an even greater extent in the West Coast region (a

$5.82

per barrel favorable increase).  We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins had a $1.0 billion favorable impact t
o our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced

1.04 billion

barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2009.  Gasoline margins were higher in 2009 as compared to 2008 despite a decrease in gasoline prices during 2009.  We believe that the margins for gasoline improved due to a greater percentage decrease in the cost of crude oil as compared to the percentage decrease in the price of gasoline.

In addition, the margins we received for other products, such as petroleum coke and sulfur, for the year ended December 31, 2009 improved by $2.1 billion as compared to 2008.  We believe that the margins were higher in 2009 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oil in 2009 as compared
 to 2008.  For example, the benchmark reference price of WTI crude oil was

$61.69

per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to

$99.56

per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a decrease of $37.87 per barrel.  Because the prices for these other products are not significantly influenced by the cost of crude oil, changes in the cost of crude oil have a significant effect of the margins we receive for these products.

For the year ended

December 31,

, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was lower than the differential for the year ended

December 31, 2008

. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of

$5.19

per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended

December 31, 2009

. This compared to a discount of

$15.71

per barrel during the year ended

December 31, 2008

, representing an unfavorable decrease of

$10.52

per barrel. However, this narrower differential in


was offset by a reduction of 174,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during


as compared to


<
font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:11pt;">, which resulted primarily from the temporary shutdown of our Aruba Refinery commencing in July 2009. We estimate that the narrower differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, negatively impacted our overall refining margin for


by $2.6 billion as we processed 874,000 barrels per day of sour crude oils.

Refining operating expenses were 23 percent lower (or

$851 million

) for the year ended

December 31, 2009

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2008

primarily due to a decrease of $490 million in energy costs, a decrease of $171 million in maintenance expenses, a decrease of $48 million in sales and use taxes, and a decrease of $43 million resulting from no longer operating the Krotz Springs Refinery, which was sold in 2008.



Retail

Retail operating income was

$293 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

compared to

$369 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2008

. This 21 percent decrease (or $76 million) was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins of $124 million, offset by a $50 million decrease in operating expenses.

The decrease in retail fuel margins was due to the effect of significantly higher margins in 2008. The hi
gher margins in 2008 were caused by a decrease in the supply of fuel in connection with the temporary shutdown of refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Ike during the third quarter of 2008. Many of those refineries became operational by the fourth quarter of December 2008, and fuel supply and margins returned to normal levels. There were no similar events that occurred in 2009.

The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $24 million decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in operating expenses due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2008. On average, Cdn.$1 was equal to $0.88 during 2009 compared to $0.95 during 2008, representing a decrease in value of seven percent. The weaker Canadian dollar had an $18 million favorable impact on the 2009 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operatio
ns compared to 2008.

Ethanol

Ethanol operating income was

$165 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009, as described in

Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not own or operate any ethanol plants prior to this acquisition.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses increased

$13 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2008

mainly due to an increase of $39 million in litigation costs, an increase of $10 million in severance expenses, and acquisition costs of $10 million related to the acquisition of seven ethanol plants. These increases were partially offset by reductions of $29 million in environmental remediation expenses and $16 million in professional fees.

“Other income, net” for the year ended

December 31, 2009

decreased

$96 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2008

primarily due to a $128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the Alon earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments as discussed in Notes 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, reduced interest income of $37 million resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a $14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by a $55 milli
on increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and $27 million of income resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to a prior acquisition in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations.

Interest and debt expense increased $56 million mainly due to interest incurred on $1.0 billion of notes issued in March 2009.

Income tax expense decreased

$1.5 billion

from

$1.4 billion

of expense in 2008 to a

$43 million

benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of a significant portion of the

$4.0 billion

goodwill impairment loss in 2008.

“Income (loss) from discontinued operat
ions, net of income taxes” for the year ended

December 31, 2009

increased

$1.7 billion

from the year ended

December 31, 2008

primarily due to the $1.2 billion after tax loss on the permanent shut down of our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2010

was

$3.0 billion

compared to

$1.8 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a $923 million tax refund in


.

Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended

December 31, 2010

and


are shown in

Note 19

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in


due to significant 
increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2010 compared to such prices at the end of


.

The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended

December 31, 2010

, combined with

$1.5 billion

of proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015,
 $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020, and $300 million of GO Zone Bonds as discussed in

Note 11

of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,

$547 million

of proceeds from the Paulsboro Refinery sale,

$220 million

of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets, and

$330 million

of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest
 in CHOPS as discussed in

Note 3

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:

•

fund

$2.3 billion

of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;

•

redeem our 7.5% senior notes for

$294 million

and our 6.75% senior notes for

$190 million

;

•

make scheduled long-term note repayments of $33 million;

•

make net repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of

$100 million

;

•

pay common stock dividends of

$114 million

;

•

purchase additional ethanol facilities for

$260 million

; and

•

increase available cash on hand by

$2.5 billion

.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2009

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2009

was

$1.8 billion

compared to

$3.1 billion

for the year ende
d

December 31, 2008

. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the $4.2 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss and gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery, both of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in


and


and a net $1.4 billion favorable eff
ect from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable between the two years. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended

December 31, 2009

and


are shown in

Note 19

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in


due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2009
 compared to such prices at the end of 2008.

The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended

December 31, 2009

, combined with

$998 million

of proceeds from the issuance of

$1.0 billion

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,

$799 million

of net proceeds from the issuance of

46 million

shares of common stock in June 2009 as discussed in

Note 13

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,

$100 million

of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables, and

$115 million

of available cash on hand were used mainly to:

•

fund

$2.7 billion

of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;

•

fund the acquisition of seven ethanol plants for

$556 million

;

•

make scheduled long-term note repayment
s of

$285 million

; and

•

pay common stock dividends of

$324 million

.



Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows (in millions):

Capital Investments

During the year ended

December 31, 2010

, we expended

$1.7 billion

for capital expendi
tures and

$535 million

for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended

December 31, 2010

included $740 million of costs related to environmental projects.

For 2011, we expect to incur approximately $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.4 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $260 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $510 million for deferred turnaround an
d catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.

In January 2010, we acquired two ethanol plants and inventories for a total purchase price of

$202 million

. The plants are located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio. In February 2010, we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin plus certain receivables and inventories for a total consideration of

$
79 million

. Of the

$281 million

of total consideration paid for these acquisitions,

$21 million

was paid in the fourth quarter of


.

On June 1, 2010, we sold the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to PBF for

$220 million

of cash proceeds, and on December 17, 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one-year note secured by the Paulsboro Refinery.



Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2010

are summarized below (in millions).

Debt and Capital Lease Obligations

During 2010, the following activity occurred related to our non-bank debt:

•

in February 2010, we issued $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015 and $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020 for total net proceeds of $1.244 billion;

•

in March 2010, we redeemed our 7.50% senior notes with a maturity date of June 15, 2015 for $294 million, or 102.5% of stated value, resulting in a $2 million gain;

•

in April 2010, we made scheduled debt repayments of $8 million related to our Series A 5.45%, Series B 5.40%, and Series C 5.40% industrial revenue bonds;

•

in May 2010, we redeemed our 6.75% senior notes with a maturity
 date of May 1, 2014 for $190 million, or 102.25% of stated value, resulting in a $3 million loss;

•

in June 2010, we made scheduled debt repayments of $25 million related to our 7.25% debentures; and

•&nb
sp;

in December 2010, we received proceeds of $300 million under a financing agreement associated with the issuance of $300 million of GO Zone Bonds.

On February 1, 2011, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $210 million related to our 6.75% senior notes. On February 2, 2011, we paid

$300 million

to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which were subject to mandatory tender on that date.  We expect to hold the GO Zone Bonds for our own account until conditions permit the rema
rketing of these bonds at an interest rate acceptable to us.

We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to

$1.0 billion

of eligible trade receivables, which matures in June 2011. As of

December 31, 2010

, the amount of eligible receivables sold was

$100 million

. During the year ended

December 31, 2010

, we reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by

$100 million

. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt.

Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2010, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:

<
/div>

We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that 
these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.

Operating Lease Obligations

Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean
- -going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined product and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.

Purchase Obligations

A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchase
d, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of

December 31, 2010

, our short-term and long-term purchase obligations increased by $6.4 billion from the amount reported as of

December 31, 2009

. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at

December 31, 2010

compared to

December 31, 2009

.

Other Long-term Liabilities

Our other long-term liabilities are described in

Note 10

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of

December 31, 2010

.



Other Commercial Commitments

As of

December 31, 2010

, our committed lines of credit were as follows:

As of

December 31, 2010

, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of

December 31, 2010

expire during 2011 and 2012.

Stock Purchase Programs

As of

December 31, 2010

, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately

$3.5 billion

of our common stock.

Pension Plan Funded Status

During


, we contributed $50 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a

5.40 percent

discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of

December 31, 2010

, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 95 percent of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of


.

We have no minimum required contributions to our pension plans during 2011 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately

$100 million

to our pension plans during 2011.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations.

While debate continues in the U.S.
 Congress regarding greenhouse gas legislation, the regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level has now shifted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began regulating greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act). According to statements by the EPA, any new construction or material expansions will require that, among other things, a greenhouse gas permit be issued at the state or federal level in accordance with the Clean Air Act and regulations, and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The determination will be on a case by case basis, and the EPA has provided only general guidance on which controls will be required. Any such controls, however, could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, wh
ich could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.



In addition, certain states have pursued independent regulation of greenhouse gases at the state level. For example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB 32, directs the CARB to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020. CARB has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal, including a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as a state-wide cap-and-trade program. The LCFS is effective in 2011, with small reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California. The mandated reductions in carbon intensity are scheduled to increase through 2020, after which another step-change in reductions is anticipated. The LCFS is designed to encourage substitution of traditional petroleum fuels, and, over time, it is anticipated that the LCFS will lead to a greater use of electric cars and alternative fuels, such as E85, as companies seek to generate more cre
dits to offset petroleum fuels. The state-wide cap-and-trade program will begin in 2012. Initially, the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases (

e.g

., refinery and power plant greenhouse gas emissions). Greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in California will be covered by the program beginning in 2015. We anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program, but we expect that compliance costs will be significant, particularly beginning in 2015, when fuels are included in the program. Complying with AB 32, including the LCFS and the cap-and-trade program, could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for,
 the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

On June 30, 2010, the EPA formally disapproved the flexible permits program submitted by the TCEQ in 1994 for inclusion in its clean-air implementation plan.  The EPA determined that Texas’ flexible permit program did not meet several requirements under the federal Clean Air Act.  Our Port Arthur, Texas City, Three Rivers, McKee and Corpus Christi East and West Refineries formerly operated under flexible permits administered by the TCEQ.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the conversion of our flexible permits into federally enforc
eable conventional state NSR permits (“de-flexed permits”).  We are now in the process of incorporating these de-flexed permits into our Title V permits.  Continued discussions with EPA regarding this matter are likely.

Meanwhile, EPA has formally disapproved other TCEQ permitting programs that historically have streamlined the environmental permitting process in Texas.  For example, EPA has disapproved the TCEQ pollution control standard permit, thus requiring conventional permitting for future pollution control equipment.  Litigation is pending from industry groups and others against EPA for each of these actions.  EPA has also objected to numerous Title V permits in Texas and other states, including permits at our Port Arthur, Corpus Christi East, and 
McKee Refineries.  Environmental activist groups have filed a notice of intent to sue EPA, seeking to require EPA to assume control of these permits from the TCEQ.  All of these developments have created substantial uncertainty regarding existing and future permitting. Because of this uncertainty, we are unable to determine the costs or effects of EPA’s actions on our permitting activity.  But EPA’s disruption of the Texas permitting system could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Tax Matters

As discussed in

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to



our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.

Effective June 1, 2010, the GOA enacted a new tax re
gime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in Aruba. Under the new tax regime, we are subject to a profit tax rate of 7 percent and a dividend withholding tax rate of 0 percent. In addition, all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees. Beginning June 1, 2012, we will also make a minimum annual tax payment of $10 million (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years.

The new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement that we entered into on February 24, 2010 with the GOA that established the terms for settlement of a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties. On May 30, 2010, the Aruban Parliament adopted several laws that implement
ed the provisions of the settlement agreement, which became effective June 1, 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we relinquished the provisions of the previous tax holiday regime. On June 4, 2010, we made a payment to the GOA of $118 million (primarily from restricted cash held in escrow) in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to June 1, 2010.

Financial Regulatory Reform

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). The Wall Street Reform Act, among many things, creates new re
gulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses. Rules to implement the Wall Street Reform Act are being finalized and therefore, the impact to our operations is not yet known. However, implementation could result in higher margin requirements, higher clearing costs, and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities.

Other

Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers
. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.

We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private c
apital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in

Note 1

of Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
 estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary
 to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates.  See

Note 4

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations.

We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in “

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

– Environmental Matters

,” could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.

Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws



and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.

The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended

December 31, 2010

,


, and


is included in

Note 10

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on pl
an assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2010

and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2011 (in millions):

See

Note 14

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.



Tax Matters

Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing
 tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts.

We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different
 interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.

Legal Matters

A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of rele
vant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. See

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RI
SK

We are exposed to market risks related to the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our refining operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we enter into commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:

•

inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year LIFO inventory levels differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and

•

forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

<
font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:11pt;">

We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations.  We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to commodities that we perceive as opportunities to benefit our results of operations and cash flows, but for which there are no related physical transactions.

Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monito
red and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.

The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions):

See

NTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT

’

S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) for Valero. Our management evaluated the effectivenes
s of Valero’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2010

. In its evaluation, management used the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management believes that as of

December 31, 2010

, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting fir
m has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which begins on page 57 of this report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of

December 31, 2010

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2010

. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility i
s to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2010

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2010

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2010

, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated

February 25, 2011

, expressed an unqualified opinion 
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company’s) internal control over financial repor
ting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted ou
r audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
 control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets th
at could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

As used in this report, the terms “Valero,” “we,” “us,” or “our” may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. We are an independent petroleum refining and marketing company and own


refineries with a combined total throughput capacity of approximately

2.6 million

barrels per day as of

December 31, 2010

. We market our refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and approximately

5,800

retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States (U.S.) and eastern Canada under various brand names including Valero

®

, Diamond Shamrock

®

, Shamrock

®

,

Ultramar

®

, and Beacon

®

. We also produce ethanol, and as of

December 31, 2010

, we operated ten ethanol plants in the Midwest with a combined capacity of approximately

1.1 billion

gallons per year. Our operations are affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds;

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving season and heating oil during the winter season; and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differentials between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenanc
e turnarounds.

The terms UDS Acquisition and Premcor Acquisition used elsewhere in these notes refer to the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation (UDS) into Valero effective December 31, 2001 and the merger of Premcor Inc. (Premcor) into Valero effective September 1, 2005, respectively.

We have evaluated subsequent events that occurred after

December 31, 2010

through the filing of this Form 10-K. Any material subsequent events that occurred during this time have been properly recognized or disclosed in our financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

Reclassifications

As discussed in

Note 3

, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010. As a
 result, the assets and liabilities sold have been presented in the consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2009, and the results of operations of the Paulsboro Refinery have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all years presented.

Also as discussed in

Note 3

, we sold our shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets in June 2010. As a result, these assets have been presented in the consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale as of December 
;31, 2009. The results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all years presented.

In addition, certain amounts previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation. Credit card fees previously recognized in 2009 and 2008 in retail operating expenses have been reclassified to cost of sales as such fees are directly and jointly related to the sale transaction. This reclassification resulted in an increase in cost of



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

sales and a decrease in retail operating expenses of

$76 million

and

$92 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2009

and


, respectively.

Principles of Consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in significant noncontrolled entities are accounted for using the equity method.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board amend
ed Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, “Consolidation,” to modify provisions related to variable interest entities to include entities previously considered qualifying special-purpose entities, as the concept of these entities was eliminated. This modification also clarified consolidation requirements and expanded disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities. These provisions of ASC Topic 810 were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, and earlier application was prohibited. The adoption of these provisions of ASC Topic 810 effective January 1, 2010 did not affect our financial position or results of operations.

Use o
f Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments

Our tempo
rary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments that have a maturity of three months or less when acquired.

Receivables

Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is adjusted based on management’s assessment of our customers’ historical collection experience, known credit risks and industry and economic conditions.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing, refined products, and grain and ethanol inventories are determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO method, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies, and convenience store merchandise are determined principally under the weighted-average cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Additions to property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and certain costs allocable to construction and property purchases, are recorded at cost.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The costs of minor property units (or components of property units), net of salvage value, that are retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation under the com
posite method of depreciation. Gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are recorded in income and are reported in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the refining and retail segments is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related facilities primarily using the composite method of depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the ethanol segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each individual asset. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the sho
rter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Deferred Charges and Other Assets

“Deferred charges and other assets, net” include the following:

•

refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at our refineries and which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs;

•

fixed-bed catalyst costs, representing the cost of catalyst that is changed out at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed function, which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the es
timated useful life of the specific catalyst;

•

investments in entities that we do not control; and

•

other noncurrent assets such as convenience store dealer incentive programs, nonqualified pension plan assets, debt issuance costs, and various other costs.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalysts costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use
 and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods. See

Note 4

for our impairment evaluation of our long-lived assets.

Goodwill was tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the asset was impaired. We used October 1 of each year as our valuation date for annual impairment testing purposes. See

Note 4

for our impairment evaluation of goodwill in 2008, which resulted in the write-off of all of our goodwill.

We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

of the investment and its carrying amount. See Notes 3 and 9 regarding the sale of our equity method investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS).

Environmental Matters

Liabilities for future reme
diation costs are recorded when environmental assessments from governmental regulatory agencies and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a


-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies, without establishing a range of loss for these liabilities. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in
 proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record a liability, which is referred to as an asset retirement obligation, at fair value for the estimated cost to retire a tan
gible long-lived asset at the time we incur that liability, which is generally when the asset is purchased, constructed, or leased. We record the liability when we have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire the asset and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability’s fair value.

Transfers of Financial Assets

In June 2009, ASC Topic 860, “Transfers and Servicing,” was modified to clarify the requirements fo
r derecognizing transferred financial assets, remove the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and related exceptions, and require additional disclosures related to transfers of financial assets. This guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, and earlier application was prohibited. The adoption of these provisions of ASC Topic 860 effective January 1, 2010 did not affect the manner in which we account for our accounts receivable sales facility as discussed in

Note 11

, our financial position, or our results of operations.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of our Canadian and Aruban operations are the Canadian dollar and the Aruban florin, respectively. The translation of the Canadian operations into U.S. dollars is computed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year. Adjustments resulting from this translation are reported in other comprehensive income. The value of the Aruban florin is fixed to the U.S. dollar at

1.79

Aruban florins to one U.S. dollar. The translation of the Aruban operations into U.S. dollars is computed based on this fixed exchange rate for both balance sheet and
 income statement accounts. As a result, there are no adjustments resulting from this translation reported in other comprehensive income.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

Revenues for products sold by the refining, retail, and ethanol segments are recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, which is the point at which tit
le to the products is transferred, and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured.

We present excise taxes on sales by our U.S. retail system on a gross basis with supplemental information regarding the amount of such taxes included in revenues provided in a footnote on the face of the income statement. All other excise taxes are presented on a net basis.

We enter into certain purchase and sale arrangements with the same counterparty that are deemed to be made in contemplation of one another. We
 combine these transactions and, as a result, revenues and cost of sales are not recognized in connection with these arrangements. We also enter into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with our customers by accessing refined products in markets where we do not operate our own refineries. These refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no revenues are recorded on these transactions.

Product Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for our share-based compensation plans is based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each award. For new grants that have retirement-eligibility provisions, we use the non-substantive vesting period approach, under which compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if that date is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes in income tax expense.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Participating share-based payment awards are included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two-class method. Earnings per common share assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution arising from our outstanding stock options and nonvested shares granted to employees in connection wi
th our stock compensation plans. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of earnings per common share – assuming dilution when the effect of including such shares would be antidilutive when applied to income (loss) from continuing operations.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted amendments to ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share,” which require participating share-based payment awards to be included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two-class method and require the restatement of prior period earnings per share. S
hares of restricted stock granted under certain of our stock-based compensation plans represent participating share-based payment awards covered by these provisions. The adoption of these provisions did not have any effect on the calculation of the basic loss per common share from continuing operations for the year ended


.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

In January 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” were modi
fied to require additional disclosures, including transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the gross basis presentation of the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures related to Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 (including interim periods). Early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective December 31, 2009 did not affect our financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affected our disclosures.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, receivables, payables, debt, capital lease obligations, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign currency derivative contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts, except for certain debt as discussed in

Note 11

. The fair values of our debt, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign currency derivative contracts were estimated primarily based on year-end quoted market prices for identical and similar assets and liabilities in active markets.

Derivatives and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading activity. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects 
income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedging relationships (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. Income effects of commodity derivative instruments, other than certain contracts related to an earn-out agreement discussed in Notes 3 and 20, are recorded in cost of sales while income effects of interest rate swaps (if applicable) are recorded in interest and debt expense. The cash flow effects of all of our derivative contracts are reflected in cash flows from operating activities.



VALERO
 ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In March 2008, ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” was modified to establish disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. The required disclosures include qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about contingent features related to credit risk in derivative agreements. These disclosures were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of these provisi
ons of ASC Topic 815 effective January 1, 2009 did not affect our financial position or results of operations but did result in additional disclosures, which are provided in

Note 21

.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Business Combinations

In December 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” were modified to specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, then the entity should disclose pro forma revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. In addition, the supplemental pro forma disclosures were expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2011 will not affect our fin
ancial position or results of operations because these requirements only affect disclosures.

Receivables

In July 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 310, “Receivables,” were amended to enhance the disclosures about the credit quality of an entity’s financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses. For public entities, the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010; disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or
 after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance effective December 31, 2010 did not affect our financial position or results of operations nor will it affect our future financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affect disclosures.

2.

ACQUISITIONS

Acquisitions of Ethanol Plants

The acquired ethanol businesses as discussed below involve the production and marketing of ethanol and its co-products, including distillers grains. The operations of our ethanol business complement our existing clean motor fuels business.

ASA and Renew Assets

In December 2009, we signed an agreement with ASA Ethanol Holdings, LLC (ASA) to buy two ethanol plants located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio and made a

$20 million

advance payment towards the acquisition of these plants. On January 13, 2010, we completed the acquisition of these plants, including certain inventories, for total consideration of

$202 million

.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Also in December 2009, we received approval from a bankruptcy court to acquire an ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin from Renew Energy LLC (Renew) and made a

$1 million

advance payment towards the acquisition of this plant. We completed the acquisition of this plant, including certain receivables and inventories, on February 4, 2010 for total consideration of

$79 million

.

The assets acquired from ASA and Renew were recognized at acquisition-date fair values as determined by independent appraisals and other evaluations as follows (in millions):

Neither goodwill nor a gain from a bargain purchase was recognized in conjunction with the ASA and Renew acquisitions, and no contingent assets or liabilities were acquired or assumed. Because these acquisitions were not material to our results of operations, we have not presented pro forma results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2010

and


, or actual results of operations from the acquisition dates through December 31, 2010. The consolidated statement of income for the year ended

December 31, 2010

includes the results of the ASA and Re
new acquisitions from their acquisition dates in


.

VeraSun Assets

In the second quarter of 2009, we acquired

seven

ethanol plants and

a

site under development from VeraSun Energy Corpor
ation (VeraSun). The acquisition of these ethanol plants (referred to as the VeraSun Acquisition) was completed under three separate closing transactions. The ethanol plants are located in Charles City, Fort Dodge, Hartley, and Albert City, Iowa; Aurora, South Dakota; Welcome, Minnesota; Albion, Nebraska; and the site under development is located in Reynolds, Indiana.

Consideration for the VeraSun Acquisition was

$477 million

plus

$79 million

primarily for inventory and cer
tain other working capital. We incurred approximately

$10 million

of acquisition-related costs that were recognized in general and administrative expenses in


. The acquisition was funded with part of the proceeds from a

$1.0 billion

issuance of notes in March 2009, which is discussed in

Note 11

.

The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were recognized at their acquisition-date fair values as determined by an independent appraisal and other evaluations as follows (in millions):



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Neither goodwill nor a gain from a bargain purchase was recognized in conjunction with the VeraSun Acquisition, and no contingent assets or liabilities were acquired or assumed.

The consolidated statements of income include the results of operations of the ethanol plants commencing on their closing dates in the second quarter of


. Actual and pro forma information related to the VeraSun Acquisition is presented below (in millions, except per share amounts). The pro forma information assumes the acquisition date had occurred as of January 1 of each respective year and that the purchase price was funded with proceeds from the issuance of

$556 million

of debt. The consolidated pro forma financ
ial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations.

Minor Acquisitions

In June 2009, we acquired the Trans-Texas Pipeline, the Wynnewood Pipeline, and their related tank and storage facilities from NuStar Logistics, L.P. for

$29 million

. These assets provide transportation and storage services for moving r
efined products from our McKee Refinery to Mont Belvieu, Texas, and from our Ardmore Refinery to the Magellan pipeline system in the Midwest.

In August 2008, we acquired


convenience stores and fueling kiosks from Albertson’s LLC for

$87 million

, including

$4 million

for inventory. These retail sites, which are located i
n Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and Louisiana, enhance our existing retail network and supply chain.

In February 2008, we acquired ConocoPhillips’ one-third undivided joint interest in a refined product pipeline and terminal for

$57 million

. These assets provide transportation and storage services for moving refined products from our McKee Refinery to markets in El Paso, Texas and Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.

SALES OF ASSETS

Paulsboro Refinery

On

December 17, 2010

, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding Company LLC (PBF Holding). Working capital, consisting primarily of inventory, was included as part of this transaction. The results of operations of the Paulsboro Refinery, including the loss on the sale discussed below, have been presented as discontinued operations for all years presented.

We received total proceeds of

$707 million

, including

$361 million

from the sale of working capital, resulting in a pre-tax loss of

$980 million

(

$610 million

after taxes). The loss includes a

$50 million

charge related to a LIFO inventory liquidation that resulted from the sale of inventory to PBF Holding and the effect of a

$40 million

accrual to settle differences between estimated and actual inventory volumes sold. The sale proceeds consisted of

$547 million

of cash and a

$160 million

note secured by the Paulsboro Refinery. The note matures in December 2011 and bears interest at

LIBOR plus 700 basis points

. PBF Holding has the option to extend the note for six months, however, the interest rate for the additional six months will be

LIBOR plus 900 basis points

.

The following financial information summarizes the Paulsboro Refinery assets and liabilities sold on

December 17, 2010

and the comparative amounts as of

December 31, 2009

(in millions), which have been reclassified to assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale.

Results of
 operations of the Paulsboro Refinery prior to its sale, excluding the loss on the sale in 2010, are shown below (in millions).

Delaware City Refinery Assets and Associated Terminal and Pipeline Assets

On November 20, 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery, and we recorded a pre-tax loss of

$1.9 billion

, of which

$1.4 billion

represented the write-down of the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value. The results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery have been presented as discontinued operations for all years presented because of the permanent shutdown of the

S TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

refinery. Certain terminal and pipeline assets previously associated with the refinery were not shut down and continued to be operated until the date of their sale. The results of their operations are reflected in continuing operations for all years presented due to our post-closing participation in the terminalling agreement described below.

On

June 1, 2010

, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and the terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP (PBF) for

$220 million

of cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a gain of

$92 million

(

$58 million

after taxes) related to the shutdown refinery assets and a gain of

$3 million

related to the terminal and pipeline assets. The gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets primarily resulted from receiving proceeds related to the scrap value of the assets and the reversal of certain liabilities recorded in


in connection with the shutdown of the refinery, which we will not incur because of the sale. This gain is presented in discontinued operations for the year ended

December 31, 2010

.

The following financial information summarizes the Delaware City Refinery assets sold on June 1, 2010 and the comparative amounts as of

December 31, 2009

(in millions), which have been reclassified to assets held for sale.

Results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery prior to its sale, excluding the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shut down of the refinery in 2009, are shown below (in millions).

Krotz Springs Refinery

On

July 1, 2008

, we sold our Krotz Spring Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon), a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy, Inc. In addition, we sold working capital, consisting primarily of inventory, to Alon as part of this transaction. The nature and significance of our post-closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represented a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations for the year ended

December 31, 2008

. Under the off
take agreement, we agreed to (i) purchase all refined products from the Krotz Springs Refinery for three months after the effective date of the sale, (ii) purchase certain products for an additional one to five years after the expiration of the initial three-month period of the agreement, and (iii) provide certain refined products to Alon that are not produced at the Krotz Springs Refinery for an initial term of


months and thereafter until terminated by either party.

ONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

We received total cash proceeds, net of certain costs related to the sale, of $

463 million

, including approximately $

135 million

from the sale of working capital, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $

305 million

($

170 million

In addition to the cash consideration received, we also received contingent consideration in the form of a three-year earn-out agreement based on certain product margins. This earn-out agreement qualified as a derivative contract and had a fair value of

$171 million

as of July 1, 2008. We hedged the risk of a decline in the referenced product margins by entering into certain commodity derivative contracts. On August 27, 2009, we settled the earn-out agreement with Alon for

$35 million

, of which

$18 million

was received on the settlement date and the remaining amount will be received in eight payments of

$2.2 million

each quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of


. In connection with the settlement of the earn-out agreement, we effectively closed our positions in the related commodity derivative contracts during the third quarter of


, and we locked in

$175 million

of cash proceeds on those contracts, approximately

$105 million

of which was received as of

December 31, 2009

with the remaining proceeds to be received in varying monthly amounts through July 2011. As such, the total amount earned on the Alon earn-out agreement, including the related commodity derivative contracts, was

$210 million

IMPAIRMENTS

General

In late 2008, the U.S. and worldwide economies experienced severe disruptions in their capital and commodities markets that resulted in a significant slowdown that persisted th
roughout 2009. This slowdown negatively impacted refining industry fundamentals and the demand and prices for our refined products. We responded to this negative economic environment and its impact on our business by assessing the operating performance and profitability of our refining segment assets. This assessment led to our decision to shut down our Aruba Refinery temporarily in July 2009, to shut down our Delaware City Refinery permanently in late 2009 and ultimately sell that refinery in June 2010, and to sell our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010, as discussed in

Note 3

. We also temporarily suspended construction activity on various capital projects and permanently cancelled other projects, as discussed below under

“

C
apital Projects.

”

The negative economic conditions also contributed to a significant decline in our common stock price in late 2008 and caused our equity market capitalization to fall significantly below our net book value. We determined that our goodwill was impaired, and it was written off in 2008, as discussed below under

“

Goodwill.

”

Long-Lived Assets, Excluding Capital Projects

The U.S. and worldwide economies and refining industry fundamentals  improved throughout


, resulting in a significant improvement in the operating results of all of our refining segment assets. These improvements led to our decision to commence refinery-wide maintenance at our temporarily shutdown Aruba Refinery during the third quarter of 2010 to prepare the refinery’s production units for restart in January 2011; however, we evaluated our Aruba Refinery for potential impairment as of

December 31, 2010

because of its temporary shutdown since July 2009 and the sensitivity of its profitability to sour crude oil d
ifferentials. Sour crude oil differentials improved in 2010 along with other refining industry fundamentals, but their improvement was less significant. We considered these positive developments in our impairment evaluation and concluded that our Aruba Refinery was not impaired as of

December 31, 2010

. Our cash flow estimates for the refinery are based on our expectation that sour crude oil differentials will continue to improve in connection with an increase in the demand for refined products and the increased production of sour crude oils. Should differentials fail to widen or fail to widen to amounts experienced in prior years, our cash flow estimates will be negatively impacted and we could ultimately determine that the refinery is impaired. The Aruba Refinery had a net book value of

$980 million

as of

December 31, 2010

; therefore, an impairment loss could be material to our results of operations.

Capital Projects

We have continually evaluated all of our capital projects classified as “construction in progress” since late 2008. These evaluations have led to the permanent cancellation of certain projects, resulting in write-offs of project costs 
and the recognition of asset impairment losses as shown in the table below (in millions).



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In conjunction with our e
valuation of capital projects, we suspended construction activity on various other projects in 2009, including hydrocracker projects located at our St. Charles Refinery and our Port Arthur Refinery. Due to the improvement in refining industry fundamentals in 2010, we have decided to complete the hydrocrackers and other projects, and construction activity has commenced or is planned to commence in 2011.

Goodwill

As of December 31, 2007, we had

$4.0 billion

of goodwill, which was allocated among our Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Northeast, and West Coast reportin
g units. As noted above, there were severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets in late 2008 that contributed to a significant decline in our common stock price and caused our equity market capitalization to fall significantly below our net book value. As a result, we evaluated the potential impairment of our goodwill as of

December 31, 2008

. For purposes of this evaluation, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows, with the present value determined using discount rates that reflected the risk inherent in the assets and risk premiums that reflected the volatility in the industry and the financial markets. Based on this analysis, we determined that all of the goodwill in our four reporting units was impaired, which resulted in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss for t
he year ended

December 31, 2008

as follows (in millions):

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Asset Retire
ment Obligations

We have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refinery assets due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of various component parts of each refinery at the time they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain our refinery assets and continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our refineries have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire refinery assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery, we es
timate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that cost using established present value techniques.

We also have asset retirement obligations for the removal of underground storage tanks (USTs) for refined products at owned and leased retail locations. There is no legal obligation to remove USTs while they remain in service. However, environmental laws require that unused USTs be removed within certain periods of time after the USTs no longer remain in service, usually one to two years depending on the jurisdiction in which the USTs are located. We have estimated that USTs at our owned retail locations will not remain in service after


years of use and that we will have an obligation to remove those USTs at that time. For our leased retail locations, our lease agreements generally require that we remove certain improvements, primarily USTs and signage, upon termination of the lease. While our lease agreements typically contain options for multiple renewal periods, we have not assumed that such leases will be renewed for purposes of estimating our obligation to remove USTs and signage.

The table below reflects the changes in our asset retirement obligations (in millions).

Other

Other tax liabilities relate primarily to contingent liabilities for transactional tax claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable.

Under this program, one of our marketing subsidiaries (Valero Marketing) sells eligible receivables, without recourse, to another of our subsidiaries (Valero Capital), whereupon the receivables are no longer owned by Valero Marketing. Valero Capital, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party entities and financial institutions. To the extent that Valero Capital retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased from Valero Marketing, such interest is included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of Valero Capital with those of Valero Energy Corporation; the receivables are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Valero Marketing or Valero Energy Corporation.

Certain leases for processing equipment and feedstock and refined product storage facilities provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in excess of a base amount. Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation claus
es, which vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage. Leases for convenience stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on sales volumes.

Other Commitments

We have various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. None of these obligations are associated with suppliers’ financing arrangements. These purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities.

Environmental Matters

While debate continues in the U.S. Congress regarding greenhouse gas legislation, the regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level has now shifted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began regulating greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act). According to statements by the EPA, any new construction or material expansions will require that, among other things, a greenhouse gas permit be issued at either or both the state or federal level in accordance with the Clean Air Act and regulations, and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The determination will be on a case by case basis, and the EPA has provided only genera
l guidance on which controls will be required. Any such controls, however, could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

In addition, certain states have pursued independent regulation of greenhouse gases at the state level. For example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB 32, directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020. CARB has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal, including a Low Carbon F
uel Standard (LCFS) as well as a state-wide cap-and-trade program. The LCFS is effective in 2011, with small reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California. The mandated reductions in carbon intensity are scheduled to increase through 2020, after which another step-change in reductions is anticipated. The LCFS is designed to encourage substitution of traditional petroleum fuels, and, over time, it is anticipated that the LCFS will lead to a greater use of electric cars and alternative fuels, such as E85, as companies seek to generate more credits to offset petroleum fuels. The state-wide cap-and-trade program will begin in 2012. Initially, the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases (

e.g

., refinery and power plant greenhouse gas emissions). Greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in California will be covered by t
he program beginning in 2015. We anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program, but we expect that compliance costs will be significant, particularly beginning in 2015, when fuels are included in the program. Complying with AB 32, including the LCFS and the cap-and-trade program, could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Tax Matters

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent change
s to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.

Effective June 1, 2010, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a new tax regime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in Aruba. Under the new tax regime, we are subject to a profit tax rate of

7 percent

and a dividend withholding tax rate of

0 percent

. In addition, all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees. Beginning June 1, 2012, we will also make a minimum annual tax payment of

$10 million

(payable in equal quarterly installments), with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years.

The new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement entered into on February 24, 2010 between the GOA and us that set the parties’ proposed terms for settlement of a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties.  On May 30, 2010, the Aruban Parliament adopted several laws that implemented the provisions of the settlement agreement, which became effective June 1, 2010.  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we relinquished the provisions of a previous tax holiday regime. On June 4, 2010, we made a payment to the GOA of

$118 million

(primarily from restricted cash held in escrow) in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to June 1, 2010. This settlement resulted in an after-tax gain of

$30 million

recognized primarily as a reduction to interest expense of

$8 million

and an income tax benefit of

$20 million

for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.

Health Care Reform

In March 2010, a comprehensive health care reform package composed of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Health Care Reform) was enacted into law. Provisions of the Health Care Reform are expected to affect the future costs of our health care plans. An estimate of the impacts of the Health Care Reform is not yet practicable due to the number and complexity of the provisions; however, we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Health Care Reform on our financial position and results of operations.

Litigation Matters

Retail Fuel Temperature Litigation

In 2006, a class action complaint was filed against us and several other defendants engaged in the retail and wholesale petroleum marketing business. The complaint alleges that because fuel volume increases with fuel temperature, the defendants violated state consumer protection laws by failing to adjust the volume or price of fuel when the fuel temperature exceeded 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The complaints seek to certify classes of retail consumers who purchased fuel in various locations. The complaints seek an order compelling the installation of temperature correction devices as well as monetary relief. Following the 2006 complaint, numerous other federal complaints were filed, and there are now a total of

a “damages class.”  The court has scheduled trial in the Kansas cases for May 2012. We anticipate that the non-Kansas cases will be remanded in late 2011 or early 2012 with no additional rulings on the merits or class certification. We are a party to the Kansas cases, but we have no company-owned retail locations in Kansas. We believe that we have several strong defenses to these lawsuits and intend to contest them. We have not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to this matter, but due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we believe that it is reasonably possible that we may suffer a loss wi
th respect to one or more of the lawsuits. An estimate of the possible loss or range of loss from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these cases cannot reasonably be made.

Other Litigation

We are also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related to known contingent liabilities related to these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plans

We have several qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the Qualified Plans), some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Qualified Plans cover

substantially all

e
mployees in the U.S. and generally provide eligible employees with retirement income based on years of service and compensation during specific periods. In addition, we have several nonqualified defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the Nonqualified Plans) that provide pension benefits to employees in Aruba and provide additional pension benefits to executive officers and certain other employees. The Qualified Plans and the Nonqualified Plans are collectively referred to as the Pension Plans.

We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees, referred to as other postretirement benefits. Substantially all of our employees may become eligible for these benefits if, while still working for us, they either reach normal retirement age or take early retirement. We offer retiree health care benefits through a self-insured plan 
and, for certain locations, a health maintenance organization. Life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance company. We fund our postretirement benefits other than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis. Individuals who became our employees as a result of an acquisition became eligible for other postretirement benefits under our plan as determined by the terms of the relevant acquisition agreement. In March 2010, the Health Care Reform was enacted into law. As a result, income tax expense for the year ended

December 31, 2010

includes a charge of

$16 million

related to the non-deductibility of certain retiree prescription health care costs, to the extent of federal subsidies received. Although the tax ch
ange provisions of the Health Care Reform are not effective until 2013, the effect of changes in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the period that includes the enactment date, even though the changes may not be effective until future periods.

Equity securities are held in a wide range of industrial sectors, including consumer goods, information technology, healthcare, industrials, and financial services.

(b)

This class include primarily investments in approximately

60 percent

equities and

40 percent

bonds.

The investment policies and strategies for the assets of our Qualified Plans incorporate a diversified approach that is expected to earn long-term returns from capital appreciation and a growing stream of current income. This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and the market value of the Qualified Plans’ assets may fluctuate from year to year. Risk tolerance is determined based on our financial ability to withstand risk within the investment program and the willingness to accept return volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk parameters, the Qualified Plans’ mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income investments. As of

December 31, 2010

, the target allocations for plan assets are

70 percent

equity securities and

30 percent

fixed income investments. Equity securities include international stocks and a blend of domestic growth and value stocks of various sizes of capitalization. Fixed income securities include bonds and notes issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. The aggregate asset allocation is reviewed on an annual basis.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Qualified Plans is estimated using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient. Three methods are used to derive the long-term expected returns for each asset class. Because each method has distinct advantages and disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average of the methods’ results is used.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We have various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans under which awards have been granted, which are summarized as follows:

•

The 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the OSIP) authorizes the grant of various stock and stock-based awards to our employees and our non-employee directors. Awards available under the OSIP include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. As of

December 31, 2010

, a total of

9,711,596

shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under the OSIP.

•

The Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors authorizes an annual grant of our common stock valued at

$160,000

to each non-employee director. Vesting will occur based on the number of grants received as follows: (i) initial grants will vest in three equal annual installments, (ii) second grants will vest

one third

on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining

two thirds

on the second anniversary of the grant date, and (iii) all grants thereafter will vest

100 percent

on the first anniversary of the grant date. As of

December 31, 2010

, a total of

77,839

shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

•

The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of various stock and stock-related awards to employees and prospective employees. Awards include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. As of

December 31, 2010

, a total of

46,5

shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

In addition, we maintained other stock option and incentive plans under which previously granted equity awards remain outstanding. No additional grants may be awarded under these plans.

Each of our stock-based compensati
on arrangements is discussed below.

The following table reflects activity related to our stock-based compensation arrangements (in millions):



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Stock Options

U
nder the terms of our various stock-based compensation option plans, the exercise price of options granted is not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options become exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually in

three or five

equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with unexercised options generally expiring

seven or ten years

from the date of grant.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Schole
s option-pricing model. The expected life of options granted is the period of time from the grant date to the date of expected exercise or other expected settlement. The expected life for each of the years in the table below was calculated using the safe harbor provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and No. 110 related to share-based payments. Because the vesting period for almost all of the stock options granted during the years ended

December 31, 2010

,


, and


was

three years

rather than

five years

as in prior years, historical exercise patterns did not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected life. Expected volatility is based on closing prices of our common stock for periods corresponding to the expected life of options granted. Expected dividend yield is based on annualized dividends at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate used is the implied yield currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options at the grant date.

Performance Awards

Performance awards are issued to certain of our key employees and represent rights to receive shares of our common stock upon the achievement by us of an objective performance measure. The objective performance measure is our total shareholder return, which is ranked among the total shareholder returns of a defined peer group of companies. Our ranking determines the rate at which the performance awards convert into our common shares. Conversion rates can range from

zero to a maximum of 200 percent

.

<
/div>

Performance awards vest in equal

one-third

increments (tranches) on an annual basis. Our compensation committee establishes the peer group of companies for each tranche of awards at the beginning of the

one-year

vesting period for that tranche. Therefore, performance awards are not considered to be granted for accounting purposes until our compensation committee establishes the peer group of companies for each tranche of awards. The fair value of each tranche of awards is determine
d at the time the awards are considered to be granted and is based on the expected conversion rate for those awards and the fair value per share. Fair



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

value per share is equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant date reduced by expected dividends over that tranche’s vesting period.

If a tranche of awards fails to 
meet the minimum performance measure at the end of its vesting period as established by our compensation committee, that tranche of awards remains outstanding for an additional year and may convert into our common shares that following year. If such tranche of awards does not convert to our common shares the following year, those awards are forfeited.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

In order to determine net cash provided by operating activities, net income (loss) is adjusted by, among other things, changes in current assets and current liabilities as follows (in millions):

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts reflected in the applicable consolidated balance sheets for the respective periods for the following reasons:

•

the amounts shown above exclude changes in cash and temporary cash investments, deferred income taxes, and current portion of debt and capital lease obligations, as well as the effect of certain noncash investing and financing activities discussed below;

•

the amounts shown above exclude the current assets and current liabilities acquired i
n connection with the acquisitions of ASA and Renew assets and the VeraSun Acquisition;

•

amounts accrued for capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and contingent earn-out payments are reflected in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows when such amounts are paid;

•

amounts accrued for common stock purchases in the open market that are not settled as of the balance sheet date are reflected in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows when the purchases are settled and paid;

•

changes in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held 
for sale pertaining to the operations of the Paulsboro, Delaware City, and Krotz Springs Refineries prior to their sale are reflected in the line items to which the changes relate in the table above; and

•

certain differences between consolidated balance sheet changes and consolidated statement of cash flow changes reflected above result from translating foreign currency denominated amounts at different exchange rates.

20.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

General

A fair value hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3) is used to categorize fair value amounts based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. Accordingly, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. We use appropriate valuation techniques based on the available inputs to measure the fair values of our applicable assets and liabilities. When available, we measure fair value using Level 1 inputs because they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The tables below present information (in millions) about our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of

December 31, 2010

and


.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The valuation methods used to measure our financial instruments at fair value are as follows:

•

Commodity derivative contracts, consisting primarily of exchange-traded futures and swaps, are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but since they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

The nonqualified benefit plan assets and nonqualified benefit plan liabilities categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from national securities exchanges. The nonqualified benefit plan assets categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair values of which are provided by the insurer.

As of

December 31, 2010

, cash collateral deposi
ts of

$403 million

with brokers under master netting arrangements is included in the fair value of the commodity derivatives reflected in Level 1. As of

December 31, 2009

, cash received from brokers of

$64 million

resulting from the equity in broker accounts covered by master netting arrangements exceeding the minimum margin requirements for such accounts, is netted against the fair value of the commodity derivatives reflected in Level 1. Certain of our commodity derivative contracts under master netting arrangements include both asset and liability positio
ns. We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral asset or obligation; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented on a gross basis in the tables above.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances (in millions) for fair value measurements developed using significant unobservable inputs for the years ended December 31.

For the years ended

, the amounts reflected in “total gains (losses) included in earnings” in the table above related to the earn-out agreement are reporte
d in “other income, net.” We entered into the earn-out agreement with Alon in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008 as discussed in Note 3. We also entered into commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the earn-out agreement. The gains (losses) associated with these instruments are also reported in “other income, net.”

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements

The table below presents information (in millions) about our nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of

December 31, 2009

. As of and for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, there were no nonfinancial assets or liabilities that were measured and recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

The

$16 million

fair value of the discontinued Delaware City Refinery represented our estimated net realizable value for the combined cycle power plant, which was the only part of the refinery that was deemed to have any salvage value as of

December 31, 2009

. The

$1.9 billion

loss, which is reflected in discontinued operations for the year ended

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of commodities, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and we enter into derivative instruments to manage those risks. We also enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk on other contractual derivatives into which we have entered. The only types of derivative instruments we enter into are those related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, interest rate swaps, and foreign cur
rency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below. All derivative instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values.

When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading activity. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of t
he gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedging relationships (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The cash flow effects of all of our derivative contracts are reflected in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and d
istillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our refining operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.

For risk management purposes, we use fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and economic hedges. In addition to the use of derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, we also enter into certain 
commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objective for entering into each type of hedge or trading activity is described below.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Fair Value Hedges

Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories. The level of activity for our fair value hedges is based on the level of our operating inventories, and generally represents the amount by which o
ur inventories differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels.

As of

December 31, 2010

, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into to hedge crude oil and refined product inventories. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels).

Cash Flow Hedges

Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. The objective of our cash flow hedges is to lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, product, or natural gas purchases or refined product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable. As of

December 31, 2010

, we had no outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were designated as cash
 flow hedges.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Economic Hedges

Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to (i) manage price volatility in certain refinery feedstock, refined product, and corn inventories, and (ii) manage price volatility in certain forecasted refinery feedstock, refined product, and corn purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. Our objective in entering into economi
c hedges is consistent with the objectives discussed above for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. However, the economic hedges are not designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, usually due to the difficulty of establishing the required documentation at the date that the derivative instrument is entered into that would allow us to achieve “hedge deferral accounting.”

As of

December 31, 2010

, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into as economic hedges. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels, except those iden
tified as corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Trading Activities

Derivatives entered into for trading purposes represent commodity derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes. Our objective in entering into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes is to take advantage of existing market conditions related to commodities that we perceive as opportunities to benefit our results of operations and cash flows, but for which there are no related physical transactions.

As of

December 31, 2010

, we had the following 
outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into for trading purposes. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes represent thousands of barrels, except those identified as natural gas contracts that are presented in billions of British thermal units and corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels).

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, at times we have used interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed to floating interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt. These interest 
rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. However, we have not had any outstanding interest rate swap agreements since 2006.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contrac
ts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, and therefore they are classified as economic hedges. As of

December 31, 2010

, we had commitments to purchase

$487 million

of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before

January 31, 2011

.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of

December 31, 2010

and


(in millions) and the line items in the consolidated balance sheet in which the fair values are reflected. See

Note 20

for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative instruments.

As indicated in

Note 20

, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts. In addition, in

Note 20

, we included cash collateral on deposit with or received from brokers in the fair value of the commodity derivatives; these cash amounts are not reflected in the tables below.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Market and Counterparty Risk

Our price risk management activities involve th
e receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact our overall exposure to counterparty risk because these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, financial services companies are the counterparties in certain of our price risk management activities, and such financial services companies may be adversely affected by periods of uncertainty and illiquidity in the credit and capital markets.

As of

December 31, 2010

, we had net receivables related to derivative instruments of

$4 million

from counterparties in the refining industry and

$21 million

from counterparties in the financial services industry. As of

December 31, 2009

, we had net receivables related to derivative instruments of

$19 million

from counterparties in the refining industry and

$157 million

from counterparties in the financial services industry. These amounts represent the aggregate amount payable to us by companies in those industries, reduced by



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

payables from us to those companies under master netting arrangements that allow for the setoff of amounts receivable fr
om and payable to the same party. We do not require any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating.

Effect of Derivative Instruments on Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income

The following tables provide information about the gain or loss recognized in income and other comprehensive income on our derivative instruments for the years ended

December 31, 2010

and


(in millions), and the line items in the consolidated financial statements in which such gains and losses are reflected.

For fair value hedges, no component of the derivative instruments’ gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effective
ness. No amounts were recognized in income for hedged firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges.

For cash flow hedges, no component of the derivative instruments’ gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For the year ended

December 31, 2010

, there were no amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2009, there were

$132 million

of pre-tax losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting.  This amount, which is the amount classified as a loss from discontinued operations in the table, relates to the forecasted sales of distillates that did not occur due to the shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
