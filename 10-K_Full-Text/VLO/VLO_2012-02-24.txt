December 31, 2011

. Total throughput volumes for the U.S. West Coast refining region averaged approximately 256,000 BPD for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.

Benicia Refinery

. Our Benicia Refinery is located northeast of San Francisco on the Carquinez Straits of San Francisco Bay. It processes sour crude oils into premium products, primarily CARBOB gasoline. (CARBOB is a reformulated gasoline mixture that meets the specifications of the CARB when blended with ethanol.) The refinery receives crude oil feedstocks via a marine dock that can berth large crude oil carriers and a 20-inch crude oil pipeline connected to a southern California crude oil delivery system. Most of the refinery’s products are distributed via the Kinder Morgan pipeline system in California.

Wilmington Refinery

. Our Wilmington Refinery is located near Los Angeles, California. The refinery processes a blend of lower-cost heavy and high-sulfur crude oils. The refinery can produce all of its gasoline as CARBOB gasoline and produces ultra-low-sulfur diesel, CARB diesel, and jet fuel. The refinery is connected by pipeline to marine terminals and associated dock facilities that can move and store crude oil and other feedstocks. Refined products are distributed via the Kinder Morgan pipeline system and various third-party terminals in southern California, Nevada, and Arizona.



Feedstock Supply

Approximately 63 percent of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market. Our term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at market-related prices directly or indirectly from various national oil companies (including feedstocks originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Mexico, and South America) as well as international and U.S. oil companies. The contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate them), effective as of the next scheduled renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time (

e.g

., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of the current term. The majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer’s official stated price (

i.e

., the “market” price established by the seller for all purchasers) and not at a negotiated price specific to us.

The U.S. network of crude oil pipelines and terminals allows us to acquire crude oil from producing leases,  crude oil trading centers, and ships delivering cargoes of crude oil. Our Pembroke, Quebec City, and Aruba Refineries rely on crude oil that is delivered to the refineries’ dock facilities by ship.

Refining Segment Sales

Our refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets. These sales include refined products that are manufactured in our refining operations as well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of our refineries have access to marine transportation facilities and interconnect with common-carrier pipeline systems, allowing us to sell products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and other countries. No customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total operating revenues in 2011.

Wholesale Marketing

We market branded and unbranded transportation fuels on a wholesale basis through an extensive rack marketing network. The principal purchasers of our transportation fuels from terminal truck racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and truck-delivered end users throughout the U.S., the U.K., and Ireland.

The majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero-brand family that operate approximately 4,000 branded sites in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 branded sites in the U.K. and Ireland. These sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multi-year contracts. For wholesale branded sites, we promote our Valero

®

, Beacon

®

, and Shamrock

®

brands in the U.S., and the Texaco

®

brand in the U.K. and Ireland.

Bulk Sales and Trading

We sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels in U.S. and international markets. Our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain bulk end-users such as railroads, airlines, and utilities. Our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline, barges, and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs.

We also enter into refined product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements help minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined product availability, broaden geographic distribution, and provide access to markets not connected to our refined product pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and third parties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined products from third



parties with delivery occurring at specified locations.

Specialty Products

We sell a variety of other products produced at our refineries, which we refer to collectively as “Specialty Products.” Our Specialty Products include asphalt, lube oils, natural gas liquids (NGLs), petroleum coke, petrochemicals, and sulfur.

•

We produce asphalt at five of our refineries. Our asphalt products are sold for use in road construction, road repair, and roofing applications through a network of refinery and terminal loading racks.

•

We produce napthenic oils at one of our refineries suitable for a wide variety of lubricant and process applications.

•

NGLs produced at our refineries include butane, isobutane, and propane. These products can be used for gasoline blending, home heating, and petrochemical plant feedstocks.

•

We are a significant producer of petroleum coke, supplying primarily power generation customers and cement manufacturers. Petroleum coke is used largely as a substitute for coal.

•

We produce and market a number of commodity petrochemicals including aromatic solvents (benzene, toluene, and xylene) and two grades of propylene. Aromatic solvents and propylenes are sold to customers in the chemical industry for further processing into such products as paints, plastics, and adhesives.

•

We are a large producer of sulfur with sales primarily to customers in the agricultural sector. Sulfur is used in manufacturing fertilizer.



ETHANOL

We own 10 ethanol plants with a combined ethanol nameplate production capacity of about 1.1 billion gallons per year. Our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities


that process corn to produce ethanol and distillers grains.


We source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators. Our facilities receive corn by rail and truck. We publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to use to facilitate corn supply transactions.

After processing, our ethanol is held in storage tanks on-site pending loading to trucks and railcars. We sell our ethanol (i) to large customers – primarily refiners and gasoline blenders – under term and spot contracts, and (ii) in bulk markets such as New York, Chicago, Dallas, Florida, and the U.S. West Coast. We also use our ethanol for our own needs in blending gasoline. We ship our dry distillers grains (DDG) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the U.S. and Mexico, with some sales into the Far East. We also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites.

The following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants, their approximate ethanol and DDG production capacities, and their approximate corn processing capacities.

The combined ethanol production from our plants in 2011 averaged 3.4 million gallons per day.

________________________


Ethanol is commercially produced using either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains.


During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are concentrated to yield modified distillers grains, or, after further drying, dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial replacement for corn, soybean, and dicalcium phosphate in feeds for livestock, swine, and poultry.



RETAIL

Our retail segment operations include:

•

sales of transportation fuels at retail stores and unattended self-service cardlocks,

•

sales of convenience store merchandise and services in retail stores, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

We are one of the largest independent retailers of transportation fuels in the central and southwest U.S. and eastern Canada. Our retail operations are segregated geographically into two groups: Retail-U.S. and Retail-Canada.

Retail-U.S.

Sales in Retail-U.S. represent sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise and services through our company-operated retail sites. For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, total sales of transportation fuels through Retail-U.S.’s sites averaged 119,780 BPD. In addition to transportation fuels, our company-operated stores sell convenience-type items, such as tobacco products, beer, snacks and beverages, and fast foods. Our stores also offer services such as ATM access, money orders, lottery tickets, car wash facilities, air and water, and video rentals. On

December 31, 2011

, we had 998 company-operated sites in Retail-U.S. (of which 80 percent were owned and 20 percent were leased). Our company-operated stores are operated primarily under the Corner Store

®

brand name. Transportation fuels sold in our Retail-U.S. stores are sold primarily under the Valero

®

brand.

Retail-Canada

Sales in Retail-Canada include:

•

sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise through our company-operated retail sites and cardlocks,

•

sales of transportation fuels through sites owned by independent dealers and jobbers, and

•

sales of home heating oil to residential customers.

Retail-Canada includes retail operations in eastern Canada where we are a major supplier of transportation fuels serving Quebec, Ontario, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, total retail sales of transportation fuels through Retail-Canada averaged approximately 76,100 BPD. Transportation fuels are sold under the Ultramar

®

brand through a network of 791 outlets throughout eastern Canada. On

December 31, 2011

, we owned or leased 381 retail stores in Retail-Canada and distributed gasoline to 410 dealers and independent jobbers. In addition, Retail-Canada operates 82 cardlocks, which are card- or key-activated, self-service, unattended stations that allow commercial, trucking, and governmental fleets to buy transportation fuel 24 hours a day. Retail-Canada operations also include a large home heating oil business that provides home heating oil to approximately 133,000 households in eastern Canada. Our home heating oil business is seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter.



RISK FACTORS

Our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control.

Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of U.S. and international suppliers, levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future.

Economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the U.S. and other countries. Lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.

Refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. Worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins.

A significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS) and Brent crude oils. These crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.

Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.

Our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.

Our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. (Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.) We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely



by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Specifically, if S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our future operations and financial position.

From time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. In addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.

Compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance.

The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. Certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. Environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned.

Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. We may be required to make expenditures to modify operations or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced its intent to promulgate in 2012 more stringent requirements for refinery air emissions through revisions to existing New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. In addition, the EPA has, in recent years, adopted final rules making more stringent the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, and the EPA is considering further revisions to the NAAQS. Emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities, which may result in increased capital expenditures.



Governmental restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including so-called “cap-and-trade” programs targeted at reducing carbon dioxide emissions – could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of, and reduction in demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations

.

A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.

In addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. These restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the U.S. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

We are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.

We often use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks and refined products to and from our facilities. If we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport feedstocks or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage

.

The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.

Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.



A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.

Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, encounter work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. Significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.

We are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our future liquidity, operating results, and financial condition

.

Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

Our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. We can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events.

Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.

We may incur losses as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.

We currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses.

Environmental Enforcement Matters

While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on our financial position or results of operations. We are reporting these proceedings to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.

EPA

(mobile source enforcement). In November 2010, the EPA issued a letter to us formalizing a proposed penalty of $585,000 in connection with eight alleged violations of U.S. federal fuels regulations (most of which were self-reported) purportedly occurring from March 2004 to 2006 at various refineries and terminals. We are negotiating with the EPA to resolve this matter.

EPA

(Port Arthur Refinery). We expect the EPA to assess a penalty in an amount greater than $100,000 for a flaring event that occurred at our Port Arthur Refinery in 2011. The penalty would be a stipulated amount prescribed under our consent decree with the EPA. We have not yet received a formal penalty assessment from the EPA.

EPA

(Three Rivers Refinery). We expect the EPA to assess a penalty in an amount greater than $100,000 for a flaring event that occurred at our Three Rivers Refinery in 2011. The penalty would be a stipulated amount prescribed under our consent decree with the EPA. We have not yet received a formal penalty assessment from the EPA.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)

(Benicia Refinery). In the fourth quarter of 2011, we settled 23 violation notices (VN’s) with the BAAQMD that were issued in 2009. In the first quarter of 2012, we settled five VN’s from 2009 and nine VN’s from 2010. We presently have outstanding 75 VN’s issued by the BAAQMD from 2010 to the present. These VN’s are for various alleged air regulation and air permit violations at our Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant.

, Third Judicial Circuit Court, Madison County (Case No. 03-CH-00459, filed May 29, 2003) (Hartford Refinery and terminal). The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has issued several notices of violation alleging violations of air and waste regulations at Premcor’s Hartford, Illinois terminal and closed refinery. We are negotiating the terms of a consent order for corrective action.

South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)

(Wilmington Refinery). Due to excess flare related emissions in 2011 at our Wilmington Refinery, we will pay a mitigation fee of about $2.3 million under SCAQMD Rule 1118 for emissions from refinery flares. We will pay the fee in the first quarter of 2012.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)

(Corpus Christi West Refinery). In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, we disclosed that in the second quarter of 2009, the TCEQ issued a notice of enforcement (NOE) to our Corpus Christi West Refinery. The NOE alleged excess air emissions relating to two cooling tower leaks that occurred in 2008. We settled this matter with the TCEQ



in the fourth quarter of 2011.

TCEQ

(Three Rivers Refinery). In our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we disclosed that the TCEQ had issued a proposed agreed order to our Three Rivers Refinery for various alleged air violations. We settled this matter with the TCEQ in the first quarter of 2012.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

We reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of

$2.1 billion

, or

$3.69 per share

, for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to

$923 million

, or

$1.62 per share

, for the year ended

December 31, 2010

. The improvement in net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to an increase in operating income of

$1.8 billion

attributable to the business segments outlined in the following table (in millions):

The increase of

$1.6 billion

in refining operating income was primarily due to the favorable difference between the price of sweet crude oils sourced from the inland U.S., such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), versus the price of benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent. Historically, the price of WTI-type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils. Due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region, the increased supply of WTI-type crude oil resulted in WTI-type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils for most of 2011 as compared to 2010. Our McKee and Ardmore Refineries in the U.S. Mid-Continent region process WTI-type crude oils and significantly benefited from this favorable price difference.

The increase of

$35 million

in retail operating income was primarily due to higher fuel margins and volumes in our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.

The increase of

$187 million

in ethanol operating income was primarily due to improved operating margins combined with an increase in production volumes to an average of 3.4 million gallons per day. The ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and is impacted by U.S. government subsidies and biofuels (including ethanol) mandates.

On

August 1, 2011

, we acquired

100 percent

of the outstanding shares of Chevron Limited from a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and we subsequently changed the name of Chevron Limited to Valero Energy Ltd. Valero Energy Ltd owns and operates the Pembroke Refinery. Valero Energy Ltd also owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an extensive network of marketing and logistics assets throughout the U.K. and Ireland. On the acquisition date, we initially paid

$1.8 billion

from available cash, of which

$1.1 billion

was for working capital. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we recorded an adjustment to working capital (primarily inventory), resulting in an adjusted purchase price of

$1.7 billion

. This acquisition is referred to as the Pembroke Acquisition.



On

October 1, 2011

, we acquired the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets from Murphy Oil Corporation for an initial payment of

$586 million

, which was funded from available cash. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded an adjustment related to inventories acquired that reduced the purchase price to

$547 million

.

The benefit we experienced in our refining business for most of 2011 from processing discounted WTI-type crude oils declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 as the premium of LLS and Brent crude oils versus WTI-type crude oil narrowed considerably. In addition, our fourth quarter 2011 results reflected a significant decline in margins for most of the products we produce. Product margins have since improved in early 2012, but we expect the energy markets and margins to be volatile. The U.S. and worldwide refining business continues to experience capacity rationalization, particularly in Europe, the U.S. East Coast, and the Caribbean, where declining product margins have negatively impacted refineries in those regions. In particular, our Aruba Refinery has been negatively impacted. We restarted the Aruba Refinery in January 2011 after shutting it down temporarily in July 2009, but the refinery has not yet generated positive cash flows on a sustained basis. We are exploring strategic alternatives for the refinery, including alternative feedstocks, configuration changes, and a temporary or permanent shutdown of the refinery facilities. We expect to conclude our evaluation of these strategic alternatives in the first quarter of 2012. A decision to temporarily or permanently shut down the refinery or a revision to the future operating plans for the refinery that results in a decrease in future expected cash flows could result in the refinery being impaired. The Aruba Refinery had a net book value of

$958 million

as of

December 31, 2011

; therefore, an impairment loss would be material to our results of operations.

As of the date of the filing of this report, the financial markets continue to experience significant volatility and the overall impact on our business is uncertain at this time.

The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and U.S. Gulf Coast region include the results of operations of our Meraux Refinery, including related logistics assets, from the date of its acquisition on October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.

(b)

The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region include the results of operations of our Pembroke Refinery, including the related market and logistics business from the date of its acquisition on August 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.

(c)

In 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and our shutdown Delaware City refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of these refineries have been presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, the operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region exclude these refineries for the year ended December 31, 2010.

(d)

We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010. The information presented includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.

(e)

Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.

(f)

Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.

(g)

The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, Port Arthur, and Meraux Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent  region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic (formerly known as Northeast) region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.

(h)

Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the price of LLS crude oil and other types of crude oil, have been included in the table of Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials. The table also includes price differentials by region between the prices of certain products and the benchmark crude oil that provides the best indicator of product margins for each region. Prior to the first quarter of 2011, feedstock and product differentials were based on the price of WTI crude oil. However, the price of WTI crude oil no longer provides a reasonable benchmark price of crude oil for all regions. Beginning in late 2010, WTI crude oil began to price at a discount to benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent, because of increased WTI supplies resulting from greater U.S. production and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region. Therefore, the use of the price of WTI crude oil as a benchmark price for regions that do not process WTI crude oil is no longer reasonable.

General

Operating revenues increased 53 percent (or

$43.8 billion

) for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations. The higher throughput volumes resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 33,000 BPD


(

$1.3 billion

of revenue) from the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on

October 1, 2011

, incremental throughput of 109,000 BPD


(

$7.5 billion

of revenue) from the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on

August 1, 2011

, and incremental throughput of 145,000 BPD ($4.9 billion of revenue) from the Aruba Refinery, which restarted operations in January 2011. Operating income increased

$1.8 billion

and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased

$1.8 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to the amounts reported for the year ended

December 31, 2010

primarily due to a

$1.6 billion

increase in refining segment operating income discussed below.

_______________


Calculated based on throughput volumes of the Meraux Refinery and the Pembroke Refinery from the date of their respective acquisitions (October 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011), divided by the number of days during the year ended December 31, 2011.



Refining

Refining segment operating income nearly doubled from

$1.9 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

to

$3.5 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

. The

$1.6 billion

improvement in operating income was due to a $2.2 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a

$462 million

increase in operating expenses.

The $2.2 billion increase in refining margin was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (a $1.50 per barrel increase between the years). This increase in refining margin was largely driven by an improvement in the U.S. Mid-Continent region, which experienced an increase in its throughput margin per barrel of

$7.77

. The U.S. Mid-Continent throughput margin per barrel of

$15.10

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

was more than double the throughput margin per barrel of

$7.33

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This increase was due to the substantial discount in the price of WTI-type crude oil, the primary type of crude oil processed by our U.S. Mid-Continent refineries, versus the price of LLS and Brent crude oils. Historically, the price of WTI-type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils, but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid-Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid-Continent region, the increased supply of WTI-type crude oil resulted in WTI-type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils during 2011. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent conventional 87 gasoline was

$22.37

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to

$8.20

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, representing a favorable increase of

$14.17

per barrel. In addition, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was

$31.06

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to

$11.91

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, representing a favorable increase of

$19.15

per barrel. We estimate that these increases in gasoline and distillate margins per barrel had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, year over year.

The increase of $462 million in operating expenses discussed above was partially due to $42 million in operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, and $141 million in operating expenses of the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011. The remaining increase of $279 million was due to a $107 million increase in chemicals and catalyst costs, an $86 million increase in employee-related expenses, and a $75 million increase in reliability expenses.

Retail

Retail operating income was

$381 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to

$346 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This 10 percent (or $35 million) increase was primarily due to increases in fuel margins of $43 million primarily from our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, and an increase in merchandise margins of $15 million, offset by increased operating expenses of

$24 million

.

Ethanol

Ethanol segment operating income was

$396 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to

$209 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This increase of

$187 million

was primarily due to a $226 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $36 million increase in operating expenses.

Gross margin increased from the year ended

December 31, 2010

to the year ended

December 31, 2011

due to an increase in ethanol production (a 331,000 gallon per day increase between the years) primarily resulting from the full operation of three additional plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 and higher utilization rates and increased yields during 2011 combined with a $0.13 per gallon increase in the ethanol gross margin.



The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to $27 million of additional expenses related to the  three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010. We operated these plants for all of 2011 compared to part of 2010.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses increased

$40 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2010

due to a $25 million increase in variable compensation expense,

$27 million

in costs incurred in connection with the Pembroke Acquisition, and a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which reduced general and administrative expenses in 2010. These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by favorable legal settlements of $47 million in 2011.

“Other income, net” for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased

$63 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2010

due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) recognized in November 2010 and the $16 million effect of earnings on our interest in CHOPS recognized in 2010.

“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” for the year ended

December 31, 2011

decreased

$83 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $62 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and the resumption of construction activity on previously suspended projects combined with a $19 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings.

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased

$651 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2010

mainly as a result of higher operating income in


and a one-time $20 million income tax benefit recognized in 2010 related to a tax settlement with the Government of Aruba (GOA).

The loss from discontinued operations of

$7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2011

is primarily due to adjustments to the working capital settlement related to the sale of our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010. The loss from discontinued operations of

$599 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

represents a $47 million after-tax loss from the discontinued operations of the Delaware City and Paulsboro Refineries and a $610 million after-tax loss on the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, partially offset by a $58 million after-tax gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets at Delaware City.

The following notes relate to references on pages


through


.

(a)

In December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding Company LLC for $547 million of cash proceeds and a

$160 million

one-year note, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the sale of

$980 million

(

$610 million

after taxes). The results of operations of the refinery, including the loss on the sale, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and North Atlantic Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.

(b)

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre-tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). In June 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP for

$220 million

of cash proceeds, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of the refinery assets of

$92 million

(

$58 million

after taxes) and an insignificant gain on the sale of the terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and North Atlantic Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. The terminal and pipeline assets associated with the refinery were not shut down in 2009 and continued to be operated until they were sold; the results of these operations are reflected in continuing operations for both years presented.

(c)

We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010 and seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.

(d)

The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.

(e)

Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.

(f)

Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.

(g)

The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Quebec City Refinery; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.

(h)

A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the GOA regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel.

General

Operating revenues increased 27 percent (or

$17.6 billion

) for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2009

primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years. Operating income increased

$1.8 billion

and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased

$1.8 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to the amounts reported for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, primarily due to a

$1.7 billion

increase in refining segment operating income discussed below.

Refining

Operating income for our refining segment increased from

$247 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

to

$1.9 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of

$1.3 billion

(discussed below), reduced asset impairment loss of

$218 million

, and the nonrecurrence of a

$114 million

loss contingency accrual in 2009. The asset impairment loss recorded in


related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. We continued to evaluate our ongoing construction projects during 2009 and 2010, but the number and significance of projects cancelled substantially declined in 2010. The loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba.



The

$1.3 billion

improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (an overall

$1.80

per barrel increase between the comparable years). The increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical (primarily propylene) margins, but these improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below.

•

Changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was

$11.14

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to

$8.02

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing a favorable increase of

$3.12

per barrel. Similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions. We estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an $820 million positive impact on our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced

712,000

BPD of distillates during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. Similarly, the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast propylene was $7.92 per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to a negative margin of $1.31 for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing a favorable increase of $9.23 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals (primarily propylene) had a $199 million positive impact on our refining margin, year over year. Distillate and propylene margins were higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the U.S. and worldwide economies and exports.

•

The WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast conventional 87 gasoline was

$7.51

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to

$7.61

per barrel for the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing an unfavorable decrease of

$0.10

per barrel. The WTI-based CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the U.S. West Coast region (a

$1.87

per barrel unfavorable decrease). We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a $119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced

1.05 million

BPD of gasoline during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. Gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010. We believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory. In addition, our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline.

•

For the year ended

December 31, 2010

, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of

$9.13

per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This compared to a discount of

$5.19

per barrel during the year ended

December 31, 2009

, representing a favorable increase of

$3.94

per barrel. The benefit of this wider differential, however, was offset by a reduction of 30,000 BPD of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009. We estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, had a $196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed

844,000

BPD of sour crude oils.



Retail

Retail operating income was

$346 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to

$293 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. This 18 percent (or $53 million) increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of $57 million and merchandise margin of $27 million, partially offset by a $28 million increase in operating expenses.

Retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price for a gallon of ethanol was $0.23 less than a gallon of U.S. Gulf Coast conventional 87 gasoline for the year ended

December 31, 2010

, but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. We estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a $32 million positive impact to our U.S. retail fuel margins for


as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended

December 31, 2010

contained 10 percent ethanol. Retail fuel margins in our Canadian retail operations increased by $27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $0.96 during 2010 compared to $0.88 in 2009, representing an increase in value of nine percent.

Retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix, and a favorable impact from the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009, as described above.

The increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar had a $21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2009.

Ethanol

Ethanol operating income was

$209 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to

$165 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. This increase of

$44 million

was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010, as described in

Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporate Expenses and Other

General and administrative expenses decreased

$41 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

compared to the year ended

December 31, 2009

primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which offset an increase in litigation costs of $40 million recorded in 2009. After adjusting for these items, the $40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of $21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of $18 million for environmental remediation expenses.

“Other income, net” for the year ended

December 31, 2010

increased

$89 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2009

due to a pre-tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS in November 2010 and the effect of a $42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earn-out agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008.

“Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest” increased

$68 million

from the year ended

December 31, 2009

to the year ended

December 31, 2010

. This increase is composed of a $53 million increase



in interest incurred on $1.25 billion of debt issued in February 2010 and $1.0 billion of debt issued in March 2009 (see

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects. We do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume.

Income tax expense increased

$618 million

from a

$43 million

benefit in


to

$575 million

of expense in


mainly as a result of higher operating income in


.

“Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” decreased

$1.1 billion

from the year ended

December 31, 2009

to the year ended

December 31, 2010

due to the after-tax loss of $1.2 billion related to the permanent shut down of our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results of operations for the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries, including the loss and gain, respectively, on their sales, are reflected in “Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” as discussed in

Note 3

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2011

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2011

was

$4.0 billion

compared to

$3.0 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the $1.8 billion increase in operating income discussed above under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.” Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended

December 31, 2011

and


are shown in

Note 19

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in


due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of


compared to such prices at the end of


.

The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended

December 31, 2011

combined with

$150 million

of proceeds from the sale of receivables and

$2.3 billion

from available cash on hand was used mainly to:

•

fund

$3.0 billion

of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;

•

purchase the Pembroke Refinery and the related marketing and logistics business for

$1.7 billion

;

•

purchase the Meraux Refinery for

$547 million

;

•

; and

•

pay common stock dividends of

$169 million

.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2010

was

$3.0 billion

compared to

$1.8 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2009

. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a $923 million tax refund in


.

Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended

December 31, 2010

and


are shown in

Note 19

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in


due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of


compared to such prices at the end of


.



The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended

December 31, 2010

, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.5% notes due in February 2015, $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020, and $300 million of GO Zone Bonds as discussed in

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $547 million of proceeds from the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, $220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets, and $330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS as discussed in

Note 3

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:

•

fund $2.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;

Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are summarized as follows (in millions):

Capital Investments

Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, and the cost of these improvements is significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.

We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process higher volumes of sour crude oil, which lowers our feedstock costs, and enables us to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity



significantly.

During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we expended

$2.4 billion

for capital expenditures and

$629 million

for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended

December 31, 2011

included

$241 million

of costs related to environmental projects.

For 2012, we expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.8 billion for capital expenditures (approximately

$140 million

of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $560 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2011

are summarized below (in millions).

Debt and Capital Lease Obligations

During 2011, the following activity occurred related to our non-bank debt:

•

in December 2011, we redeemed our Series 1997B 5.4% and Series 1997C 5.4% industrial revenue bonds for $56 million, or 100% of their stated values;

•

in May 2011, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $200 million related to our 6.125% senior notes;

•

in April 2011, we made scheduled debt repayments of $8 million related to our Series 1997A 5.45%, Series 1997B 5.4%, and Series 1997C 5.4% industrial revenue bonds;

•

in February 2011, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $210 million related to our 6.75% senior notes; and

•

in February 2011, we paid $300 million to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which were subject to mandatory tender.

We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to

$1 billion

of eligible trade receivables. We amended our agreement in June 2011 to extend the maturity date to June 2012. As of

December 31, 2011

, the amount of eligible receivables sold was

$250 million

. During the year ended

December 31, 2011

, we sold

$150 million

of eligible receivables under this program and made no repayments. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.



Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of

December 31, 2011

, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:

We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.

Operating Lease Obligations

Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.

Purchase Obligations

A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of

December 31, 2011

, our short- and long-term purchase obligations increased by approximately $6 billion from the amount reported as of

December 31, 2010

. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at

December 31, 2011

compared to

December 31, 2010

.

Other Long-term Liabilities

Our other long-term liabilities are described in

Note 10

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of

December 31, 2011

.



Other Commercial Commitments

As of

December 31, 2011

, our committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions):

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of

December 31, 2011

expire during 2012 and 2013.

Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources

Stock Purchase Programs

As of

December 31, 2011

, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately

$3.5 billion

of our common stock.

Pension Plan Funded Status

During


, we contributed $204 million to our pension plans that have minimum funding requirements. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the assets of these plans was approximately 88 percent of the projected benefit obligations under these plans.

We have minimum required contributions of

$2 million

to these pension plans during 2012; however, we plan to contribute approximately

$100 million

to our pension plans during 2012.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.

Tax Matters

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax matters.



As of December 31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009, as discussed in

Note 16

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have received Revenue Agent Reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the IRS. Although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements, should the IRS eventually prevail, it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

Cash Held by Our International Subsidiaries

We operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in

Note 16

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of

December 31, 2011

, $822 million of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.

Financial Regulatory Reform

In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). The Wall Street Reform Act, among many things, creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses. Rules to implement the Wall Street Reform Act are being finalized and therefore, the impact to our operations is not yet known. However, implementation could result in higher margin requirements, higher clearing costs, and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities.

Concentration of Customers

Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.

Sources of Liquidity

We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.



NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As discussed in

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.

Property, Plant and Equipment

The cost of property, plant and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, are capitalized. The cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets, however, is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.

Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.

Depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.

Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.



Also under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset (net of salvage value) that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset (primarily involuntary conversions). Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See

Note 4

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses.

We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.

Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.



The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended

December 31, 2011

,


, and


is included in

Note 10

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2011

and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2012 (in millions):

See

Note 14

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

Tax Matters

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts.

We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our



estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.

Legal Matters

A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:

•

inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels and

•

forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases,  and corn purchases to lock in the price of these forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.

Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.

The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions):

See

Note 21

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of

December 31, 2011

.



COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISK

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of financial instruments associated with

various governmental and regulatory compliance programs that we must purchase in the open market to comply with these programs. To reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may enter into derivative instruments, such as futures. As of December 31, 2011, there was no significant gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the futures contracts. See

Note 21

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs and notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of

December 31, 2011

.

INTEREST RATE RISK

The following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of

December 31, 2011

and


.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had commitments to purchase

$751 million

of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on the contracts, as they matured on or before

January 26, 2012

, resulting in a

$3 million loss

in the first quarter of 2012.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT

’

S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) for Valero. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of Valero’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

. In its evaluation, management used the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management believes that as of

December 31, 2011

, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Management’s evaluation of and conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting excludes the internal control over financial reporting of Valero Energy Ltd and its subsidiaries (VEL), which we acquired on

August 1, 2011

and of Valero Refining-Meraux LLC (Meraux), the operations of which we acquired on

October 1, 2011

, (as described in

Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The VEL and Meraux acquisitions contributed approximately

7 percent

of our total operating revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2011

and accounted for approximately

10 percent

of our total assets as of

December 31, 2011

. We plan to fully integrate VEL and Meraux into our internal control over financial reporting in 2012.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which begins on page


of this report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of

December 31, 2011

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2011

. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2011

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2011

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated

February 24, 2012

expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:

We have audited Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company’s) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

The Company acquired Valero Energy Ltd and its subsidiaries (VEL) on

August 1, 2011

and the operations of Valero Refining-Meraux LLC (Meraux) on

October 1, 2011

, and management excluded VEL’s and Meraux’s internal control over financial reporting from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

. The VEL and Meraux acquisitions



contributed approximately

7 percent

of the Company’s total operating revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2011

and accounted for approximately

10 percent

of its total assets as of

December 31, 2011

. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of VEL and Meraux.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2011

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2011

, and our report dated

February 24, 2012

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

General

As used in this report, the terms “Valero,” “we,” “us,” or “our” may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. We are an independent petroleum refining and marketing company and own


refineries with a combined total throughput capacity of approximately

3.0 million

barrels per day as of

December 31, 2011

. We market our refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and we sell refined products through a network of approximately

6,800

retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States (U.S.), Canada, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Aruba, and Ireland under various brand names including Valero

®

, Diamond Shamrock

®

, Shamrock

®

,

Ultramar

®

, Beacon

®

,

and

Texaco

®

. We also produce ethanol and operate

ten

ethanol plants in the U.S. with a combined nameplate production capacity of approximately

1.1 billion

gallons per year as of

December 31, 2011

. Our operations are affected by:

•

company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds;

•

seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving season and heating oil during the winter season; and

•

industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differentials between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds.

We have evaluated subsequent events that occurred after

December 31, 2011

through the filing of this Form 10-K. Any material subsequent events that occurred during this time have been properly recognized or disclosed in these financial statements.

Noncontrolling Interest

On

January 21, 2011

, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Darling Green Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Darling International, Inc., to form Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD Holdings). DGD Holdings, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Diamond Green Diesel LLC (DGD), is constructing and will operate a biomass-based diesel plant having a design feed capacity of

10,000

barrels per day that will process animal fats, used cooking oils, and other vegetable oils into renewable green diesel. The plant will be located next to our St. Charles Refinery. The aggregate cost of this facility is estimated to be approximately

$368 million

and the construction is expected to be completed in late 2012. The joint venture agreement requires that contributions be made to DGD Holdings based on the percentage of units held by each member, which is currently on a

50/50

basis. From the inception of DGD Holdings (

January 21, 2011

) through

December 31, 2011

, each member had contributed

$22 million

of cash and

$1 million

of noncash assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, and equipment, to DGD Holdings. In addition, on

May 31, 2011

, we agreed to lend DGD up to

$221 million

in order to finance

60 percent

of the construction costs of the plant.

Because of our controlling financial interest in DGD Holdings, we have included the financial statements of DGD Holdings in these consolidated financial statements and have separately disclosed the related noncontrolling interest.

Significant Accounting Policies

Reclassifications

Certain amounts previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in significant noncontrolled entities are accounted for using the equity method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Cash and Temporary Cash Investments

Our temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments that have a maturity of

three

months or less when acquired.

Receivables

Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is adjusted based on management’s assessment of our customers’ historical collection experience, known credit risks, and industry and economic conditions.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing, refined products, and grain and ethanol inventories are determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method using the dollar-value LIFO method, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies, and convenience store merchandise are determined principally under the weighted-average cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

The cost of property, plant and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, is capitalized. The cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets, however, is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.

Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

based on changing internal and external factors.

Depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from


to

30 years

.

Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.

Also under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset (net of salvage value) that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset (primarily involuntary conversions). Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.

Depreciation of property assets used in our retail segment is also recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related facilities primarily using the composite method of depreciation. However, depreciation of property assets used in our ethanol segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each individual asset. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Deferred Charges and Other Assets

“Deferred charges and other assets, net” include the following:

•

turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at our refineries and ethanol plants and which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs;

•

fixed-bed catalyst costs, representing the cost of catalyst that is changed out at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed function, which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the specific catalyst;

•

investments in entities that we do not control; and

•

other noncurrent assets such as convenience store dealer incentive programs, investments of certain benefit plans, debt issuance costs, and various other costs.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalysts costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods. See

Note 4

for our impairment analysis of our long-lived assets.

We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in income, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.

Environmental Matters

Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments from governmental regulatory agencies and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a


-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies, without establishing a range of loss for these liabilities. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties.

Asset Retirement Obligations

We record a liability, which is referred to as an asset retirement obligation, at fair value for the estimated cost to retire a tangible long-lived asset at the time we incur that liability, which is generally when the asset is purchased, constructed, or leased. We record the liability when we have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire the asset and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability’s fair value.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of each of our international operations is generally the respective local currency, which includes the Canadian dollar, the Aruban florin, the pound sterling, and the euro. Balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year presented. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues for products sold by the refining, retail, and ethanol segments are recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, which is the point at which title to the products is transferred, and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured.

We present excise taxes on sales by our U.S. retail system on a gross basis with supplemental information regarding the amount of such taxes included in revenues provided in a footnote on the face of the statements of income. All other excise taxes are presented on a net basis.

We enter into certain purchase and sale arrangements with the same counterparty that are deemed to be made in contemplation of one another. We combine these transactions and, as a result, revenues and cost of sales are not recognized in connection with these arrangements. We also enter into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with our customers by accessing refined products in markets where we do not operate our own refineries. These refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no revenues are recorded on these transactions.

Product Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for our share-based compensation plans is based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each award. For new grants that have retirement-eligibility provisions, we use the non-substantive vesting period approach, under which compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if that date is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes in income tax expense.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Participating share-based payment awards, including shares of restricted stock granted under certain of our stock-based compensation plans, are included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two-class method. Earnings per common share – assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution arising from our outstanding stock options and nonvested shares granted to employees in connection with our stock-based compensation plans. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of earnings per common share – assuming dilution when the effect of including such shares would be antidilutive.

Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, receivables, payables, debt, capital lease obligations, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign currency derivative contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts, except for certain debt as discussed in

Note 20

.

Derivatives and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading derivative. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedging relationships (derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The cash flow effects of all of our derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities in the statements of cash flows.

Business Combinations

In December 2010, the provisions of ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” were modified to specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, then the entity should disclose pro forma revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. In addition, the supplemental pro forma disclosures were expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2011 did not affect our financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affect disclosures.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 210, “Balance Sheet,” were amended to require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. These provisions are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2013 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but may result in additional disclosures.

In December 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income,” were amended to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. These provisions to ASC Topic 220 are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2011 and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2012 will not affect our financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affect presentation.

In May 2011, the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” were amended to clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and to change certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. Amendments that change measurement and disclosure requirements relate to (i) fair value measurement of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio, (ii) application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement, and (iii) additional disclosures about fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2012 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but may result in additional disclosures.

ACQUISITIONS

Acquisitions of Refineries

The acquired refining and marketing businesses as discussed below involve the production and marketing of refined petroleum products. These acquisitions are consistent with our general business strategy and complement our existing refining and marketing network.

Meraux Acquisition

On

October 1, 2011

, we acquired the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets from Murphy Oil Corporation for an initial payment of

$586 million

, which was funded from available cash. This acquisition is referred to as the Meraux Acquisition. The Meraux Refinery has a total throughput capacity of

135,000

barrels per day and is located in Meraux, Louisiana.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded an adjustment related to inventories acquired that reduced the purchase price to

$547 million

. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Meraux Acquisition were recognized at their acquisition-date estimated fair values, pending the completion of an independent appraisal and other evaluations, and are as follows (in millions):

Pembroke Acquisition

On

August 1, 2011

, we acquired

100 percent

of the outstanding shares of Chevron Limited from a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (Chevron), and we subsequently changed the name of Chevron Limited to Valero Energy Ltd. Valero Energy Ltd owns and operates the Pembroke Refinery, which has a total throughput capacity of

270,000

barrels per day and is located in Wales, U.K. Valero Energy Ltd also owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an extensive network of marketing and logistics assets throughout the U.K. and Ireland. On the acquisition date, we initially paid

$1.8 billion

from available cash, of which

$1.1 billion

was for working capital. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we recorded an adjustment to working capital (primarily inventory), resulting in an adjusted purchase price of

$1.7 billion

, as outlined below. This acquisition is referred to as the Pembroke Acquisition.

SALES OF ASSETS

Paulsboro Refinery

In December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding Company LLC (PBF Holding). Working capital, consisting primarily of inventory, was included as part of this transaction. The results of operations of the Paulsboro Refinery, including the loss on the sale discussed below, have been presented as discontinued operations for all years presented.

We received total proceeds of

$707 million

, including

$361 million

from the sale of working capital, resulting in a pre-tax loss of

$980 million

(

$610 million

after taxes). The loss includes a

$50 million

charge related to a LIFO inventory liquidation that resulted from the sale of inventory to PBF Holding and the effect of a

$40 million

accrual to settle differences between estimated and actual inventory volumes sold. The sale proceeds consisted of

$547 million

of cash and a

$160 million

note secured by the Paulsboro Refinery. In February 2012, we received full payment on this note.

Selected results of operations of the Paulsboro Refinery prior to its sale, excluding the loss on the sale in 2010, are shown below (in millions).

Delaware City Refinery Assets and Associated Terminal and Pipeline Assets

In November 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery, and we recorded a pre-tax loss of

$1.9 billion

, of which

$1.4 billion

represented the write-down of the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value. The results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery have been presented as discontinued operations for all years presented.

In June 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and the terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP for

$220 million

of cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a gain of

$92 million

(

$58 million

after taxes) related to the shutdown refinery assets and a gain of

$3 million

related to the terminal and pipeline assets. The gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets primarily resulted from receiving proceeds related to the scrap value of the assets and the reversal of certain liabilities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the shutdown of the refinery, which we will not incur because of the sale. This gain is presented in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.

interest in CHOPS to Genesis Energy, L.P. for total cash proceeds of

$330 million

. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of

$55 million

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS

In late 2008, the U.S. and worldwide economies experienced severe disruptions in their capital and commodities markets resulting in a significant economic slowdown that negatively impacted refining industry fundamentals and the demand and price for our refined products. Because of this negative impact, we decided to shut down our Aruba Refinery temporarily in July 2009. We also decided to shut down our Delaware City Refinery permanently in late 2009 and ultimately sold that refinery in June 2010, and we sold our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010, as discussed in

Note 3

. In addition, we temporarily suspended construction activity on various capital projects and permanently cancelled other projects. These permanent cancellations resulted in asset impairment losses of

$2 million

and

$222 million

for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The U.S. and worldwide economies and refining industry fundamentals improved throughout 2010 and most of 2011, resulting in a significant improvement in the operating results of all of our refining segment assets. These improvements led to our decision to restart our Aruba Refinery and resume construction activities on the majority of the previously suspended capital projects. However, we analyzed our Aruba Refinery for potential impairment as of

December 31, 2011

because of its recent temporary shutdown, its inability to generate positive cash flows on a sustained basis subsequent to its restart, and the sensitivity of its profitability to sour crude oil differentials, which narrowed significantly in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we are exploring strategic alternatives for the refinery, including alternative feedstocks, configuration changes, and a temporary or permanent shutdown of the refinery facilities.

We considered all of these matters in our impairment analysis and concluded that our Aruba Refinery was not impaired as of

December 31, 2011

. Our future cash flow estimates for the refinery are based on our expectation that refining industry fundamentals will continue to improve in connection with an increase in the demand for refined products. However, should refining industry fundamentals fail to continue to improve, our future cash flow estimates will be negatively impacted. In addition, as discussed above, we are exploring strategic alternatives for the refinery and expect to conclude our evaluation of these strategic alternatives in the first quarter of 2012. A decision to temporarily or permanently shut down the refinery or a revision to



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the future operating plans for the refinery that results in a decrease in future expected cash flows could result in the refinery being impaired. The Aruba Refinery had a net book value of

$958 million

as of

December 31, 2011

; therefore, an impairment loss would be material to our results of operations.

by

$247 million

and

$16 million

, respectively, and increased cost of sales in


by

$66 million

. The effect of the liquidation in 2010 excludes the impact from the sale of inventory in connection with the sale of our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding. The effect of the 2010 liquidation attributable to the sale of that inventory increased the loss on the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery by

$50 million

(

$31 million

after taxes) as discussed in

Note 3

and is reflected in discontinued operations.

As of

December 31, 2011

There were no significant environmental liabilities assumed in connection with the Meraux Acquisition.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Asset Retirement Obligations

We have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refinery assets due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of various component parts of each refinery at the time they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain our refinery assets and continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our refineries have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire refinery assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery, we estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that cost using established present value techniques.

We also have asset retirement obligations for the removal of underground storage tanks (USTs) for refined products at owned and leased retail locations. There is no legal obligation to remove USTs while they remain in service. However, environmental laws require that unused USTs be removed within certain periods of time after the USTs no longer remain in service, usually one to two years depending on the jurisdiction in which the USTs are located. We have estimated that USTs at our owned retail locations will not remain in service after


years of use and that we will have an obligation to remove those USTs at that time. For our leased retail locations, our lease agreements generally require that we remove certain improvements, primarily USTs and signage, upon termination of the lease. While our lease agreements typically contain options for multiple renewal periods, we have not assumed that such leases will be renewed for purposes of estimating our obligation to remove USTs and signage.

Changes in our asset retirement obligations were as follows (in millions).

There are no assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling our asset retirement obligations.

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility

We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to

Under this program, one of our marketing subsidiaries (Valero Marketing) sells eligible receivables, without recourse, to another of our subsidiaries (Valero Capital), whereupon the receivables are no longer owned by Valero Marketing. Valero Capital, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party entities and financial institutions. To the extent that Valero Capital retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased from Valero Marketing, such interest is included in our financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of Valero Capital with those of Valero Energy Corporation; the receivables are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Valero Marketing or Valero Energy Corporation.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

We have long-term operating lease commitments for land, office facilities, retail facilities and related equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined product and corn inventories.

Certain leases for processing equipment and feedstock and refined product storage facilities provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in excess of a base amount. Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage. Leases for convenience stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on sales volumes. In most cases, we expect that in the normal course of business, our leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

As of

December 31, 2011

, our future minimum rentals and minimum rentals to be received under subleases for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in millions):

Rental expense was as follows (in millions):



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Other Commitments

We have various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. None of these obligations are associated with suppliers’ financing arrangements. These purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities.

Environmental Matters

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began regulating greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011, under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act). Any new construction or material expansions will require that, among other things, a greenhouse gas permit be issued at either or both the state or federal level in accordance with the Clean Air Act and regulations, and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The determination would be on a case by case basis, and the EPA has provided only general guidance on which controls will be required.

Furthermore, the EPA is currently developing refinery-specific greenhouse gas regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose, on new and existing operations, greenhouse gas emission limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations but have not yet been delineated. Any such controls, however, could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Certain states and foreign governments have pursued regulation of greenhouse gases independent of the EPA. For example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB 32, directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020. The CARB has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal, including a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as a statewide cap-and-trade program.

•

The LCFS was scheduled to become effective in 2011, but recent rulings by the U.S. District Court have stayed enforcement of the LCFS until certain legal challenges to the LCFS have been resolved. Most notably, the court determined that the LCFS violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to the extent that the standard discriminates against out-of-state crude oils and corn ethanol. CARB has appealed the lower court’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

▪

As initially designed, the LCFS called for initially small reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California. The mandated reductions in carbon intensity were thereafter scheduled to increase through 2020, after which another step-change in reductions is anticipated.

▪

CARB designed the LCFS to encourage substitution of traditional petroleum fuels, and, over time, lead to greater use of electric cars and alternative fuels, such as E85, as companies seek to generate more credits to offset petroleum fuels.

•

A California statewide cap-and-trade program will begin in 2013. Initially, the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases (e.g., refinery and power plant greenhouse gas



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

emissions). Greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in California will be covered by the program beginning in 2015. We anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program, but we expect that compliance costs will increase significantly beginning in 2015, when transportation fuels are included in the program.

•

Complying with AB 32, including the LCFS and the cap-and-trade program, could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

In January 2012, CARB adopted amendments to its Clean Fuels Outlet (CFO) Regulation. CARB states that the CFO Regulation is intended to provide outlets of clean fuel to meet the needs of alternative fuel vehicles. The regulation would require major refiners and importers of gasoline, including Valero, to install clean fuel outlets at five percent of California’s retail stations for hydrogen fueling and electric vehicle charging. We expect this regulation to be challenged, but we could be required to make significant capital expenditures if the regulation is implemented as presently adopted.

The EPA has disapproved certain permitting programs of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that historically have streamlined the environmental permitting process in Texas. For example, the EPA has disapproved the TCEQ pollution control standard permit, thus requiring conventional permitting for future pollution control equipment. Litigation is pending from industry groups and others against the EPA for each of these actions. The EPA has also objected to numerous Title V permits in Texas and other states, including permits at our Port Arthur, Corpus Christi East, and McKee Refineries. Environmental activist groups have filed a notice of intent to sue the EPA, seeking to require the EPA to assume control of these permits from the TCEQ. All of these developments have created substantial uncertainty regarding existing and future permitting. Because of this uncertainty, we are unable to determine the costs or effects of the EPA’s actions on our permitting activity. But the EPA’s disruption of the Texas permitting system could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.

Tax Matters

We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.

As of December 31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009, as discussed in

Note 16

. We have received Revenue Agent Reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the IRS. Although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

in our financial statements, should the IRS eventually prevail, it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

Effective June 1, 2010, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a new tax regime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in Aruba. Under the new tax regime, we are subject to a profit tax rate of

7 percent

and a dividend withholding tax rate of

zero percent

. In addition, all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees. Beginning June 1, 2012, we will also make a minimum annual tax payment of

$10 million

(payable in equal quarterly installments), with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years.

The new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement entered into on February 24, 2010 between the GOA and us that set the parties’ proposed terms for settlement of a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties. On May 30, 2010, the Aruban Parliament adopted several laws that implemented the provisions of the settlement agreement, which became effective June 1, 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we relinquished certain provisions of a previous tax holiday regime. On June 4, 2010, we made a payment to the GOA of

$118 million

(primarily from restricted cash held in escrow) in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to June 1, 2010. This settlement resulted in an after-tax gain of

$30 million

recognized primarily as a reduction to interest expense of

$8 million

and an income tax benefit of

$20 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2010

.

Health Care Reform

In March 2010, a comprehensive health care reform package composed of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Health Care Reform) was enacted into law. Provisions of the Health Care Reform are expected to affect the future costs of our U.S. health care plans. We sponsor U.S. health care plans that are grandfathered under Health Care Reform and have made only those changes required by Health Care Reform to our plans. Legislative challenges have been made to several of the Health Care Reform provisions and are currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. We expect to receive more guidance on the Health Care Reform provisions which are required in 2014 and will then be able to evaluate the potential impact of the Health Care Reform on our financial position and results of operations.

Litigation Matters

We are party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We have not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to some of these matters because we have determined that it is remote that a loss has been incurred.  For other matters, we have recorded a loss contingency liability where we have determined that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable.  These loss contingency liabilities are not material to our financial position. We re-evaluate and update our loss contingency liabilities as matters progress over time, and we believe that any changes to the recorded liabilities will not be material to our financial position or results of operations.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans, some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements, that cover

most

of our employees. These plans provide eligible employees with retirement income based on years of service and compensation during specific periods. We fund our pension plans as required by local regulations. In the U.S., all qualified pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. We typically do not fund or fully fund U.S. nonqualified and certain international pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than our other investment alternatives.

We also provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees through our postretirement benefit plans. Most of our employees  become eligible for these benefits if, while still working for us, they reach normal retirement age or take early retirement. These plans are unfunded, and retired employees share the cost with us. Individuals who became our employees as a result of an acquisition became eligible for other postretirement benefits under our plans as determined by the terms of the relevant acquisition agreement.

The discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2011

for the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans was based on the Aon Hewitt AA Only Above Median yield curve and considered the timing of the projected cash outflows under our plans. This curve was designed by Aon Hewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their pension plans or postretirement benefit plans. It is a hypothetical double-A yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates with maturities from

one-half year to 99 years

. Each bond issue underlying the curve is required to have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by Moody’s Investor Services (Moody’s), Standard and Poor’s Ratings Service (S&P), and Fitch Ratings. Only the bonds representing the 50 percent highest yielding issuance among these with average ratings of double-A are included in this yield curve.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2010

for the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans was based on the Hewitt Above Median yield curve and considered the timing of the projected cash outflows under our plans. This curve was also designed by Aon Hewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their pension plans or other postretirement benefit plans. This curve was a hypothetical double yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates with maturities from

one-half year to more than 30 years

. Each bond issue underlying the curve was required to have a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s or a rating of AA or better by S&P.

We based our

December 31, 2011

discount rate assumption on the Aon Hewitt AA Only Above Median yield curve because we believe it is representative of the types of bonds we would use to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities as of that date. We believe that the market volatility of the last two to three years has largely subsided and that the yields associated with the bonds used to develop this yield curve reflect the current level of interest rates. In 2010 and 2009, we based our discount rate assumption on the Hewitt Above Median yield curve because it included a larger number of bonds which lessened the effect of outlier bonds whose yields were influenced by the volatility in the market at that time.

Plan assets for certain U.S. nonqualified pension plans are disclosed in

The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the pension plans is estimated using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient.

Three

methods are used to derive the long-term expected returns for each asset class. Because each method has distinct advantages and disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average of the methods’ results is used.

Defined Contribution Plans

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We have various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans under which awards have been granted, which are summarized as follows:

•

The 2011 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the OSIP) authorizes the grant of various stock and stock-based awards to our employees and our non-employee directors. Awards available under the OSIP include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. The OSIP was approved by our stockholders on April 28, 2011. As of

December 31, 2011

,

18,498,630

shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under the OSIP.

•

Prior to the approval of the OSIP by our stockholders, most of the equity awards granted to our employees and non-employee directors were made under our 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. Prior awards granted under this plan included options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee.

No

additional grants may be awarded under this plan.

•

The Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors authorizes an annual grant of our common stock valued at

$160,000

to each non-employee director. Vesting generally will occur based on the number of grants received as follows: (i) initial grants will vest in

three

equal annual installments, (ii) second grants will vest

one-third

on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining

two-thirds

on the second anniversary of the grant date, and (iii) all grants thereafter will vest

100 percent

on the first anniversary of the grant date. As of

December 31, 2011

,

8,289

shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

•

The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of various stock and stock-related awards to employees and prospective employees. Awards include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. As of

December 31, 2011

,

536,141

shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.

•

In addition, we maintained other stock option and incentive plans under which previously granted equity awards remain outstanding.

No

additional grants may be awarded under these plans.

Each of our stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed below.

The following table reflects activity related to our stock-based compensation arrangements (in millions):

Stock Options

Under the terms of our various stock-based compensation plans, the exercise price of options granted is not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options become exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually in

three

or

five

equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with unexercised options generally expiring

seven or ten years

from the date of grant.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected life of options granted is the period of time from the grant date to the date of expected exercise or other expected settlement. The expected life for each of the years in the table below was calculated using the safe harbor provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and No. 110 related to share-based payments. Because the vesting period for all of the stock options granted during the years ended

December 31, 2011

,


, and


was

three years

rather than

five years

as in prior years, historical exercise patterns did not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected life. Expected volatility is based on closing prices of our common stock for periods corresponding to the expected life of options granted. Expected dividend yield is based on annualized dividends at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate used is the implied yield currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options at the grant date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock is granted to employees and non-employee directors. Restricted stock granted to employees vests in accordance with individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually in equal annual installments over a period of

three to five years

beginning one year after the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to our non-employee directors vests from

one to three years

following the date of grant. A summary of the status of our restricted stock awards is presented in the table below.

As of

December 31, 2011

was

$32 million

,

$25 million

, and

$12 million

, respectively.

Performance Awards

Performance awards are issued to certain of our key employees and represent rights to receive shares of our common stock upon the achievement by us of an objective performance measure. The objective performance measure is our total shareholder return, which is ranked among the total shareholder returns of a defined peer group of companies. Our ranking determines the rate at which the performance awards convert into our common shares. Conversion rates can range from

zero

to

200 percent

.

Performance awards vest in equal

one-third

increments (tranches) on an annual basis. Our compensation committee establishes the peer group of companies for each tranche of awards at the beginning of the

one-year

vesting period for that tranche. Therefore, performance awards are not considered to be granted for accounting purposes until our compensation committee establishes the peer group of companies for each tranche of awards. The fair value of each tranche of awards is determined at the time the awards are considered to be granted and is based on the expected conversion rate for those awards and the fair value per share. Fair value per share is equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant date reduced by expected dividends over that tranche’s vesting period.

For performance awards awarded in 2010, if a tranche of these awards fails to meet the minimum performance measure at the end of its vesting period as established by our compensation committee, that tranche of awards remains outstanding for an additional year and may convert into our common shares that following year. If such tranche of awards does not convert to our common shares the following year, those awards are forfeited. Performance awards awarded in 2011 do not have carry-forward features.

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of our international subsidiaries based on the determination that such differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of these subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in the international operations. As of

December 31, 2011

, the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately

$4.9 billion

. If those earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been recorded after consideration of U.S. foreign tax credits. In addition, as a result of our Pembroke Acquisition, certain U.S. tax elections may be available to us. The decision by us to forego these elections could significantly increase our taxable earnings and profits. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

General

GAAP requires that certain financial instruments, such as derivative instruments, be recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets. However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are not required to be recognized at their fair values, but GAAP provides an option to elect fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair values of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their fair values or carrying amounts in our balance sheets. For financial instruments recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of instrument, along with other information, including changes in the fair values of certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive income, and this information is provided below under

“Recurring Fair Value Measurements.”

For financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their fair values is provided below under

“Other Financial Instruments.”

Nonfinancial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and nonfinancial liabilities are recognized at their carrying amounts in our balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires the remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the impairment of property, plant and equipment. In addition, if such an event occurs, GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair value of the asset or liability along with other information, including the gain or loss recognized in income in the period the remeasurement occurred. This information is provided below under

“Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.”

GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques based on the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. Following is a description of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

•

Level 1

- Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2

- Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

•

Level 3

- Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant judgment.

The financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities included in our disclosure of recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure their fair values.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The tables below present information (in millions) about our financial instruments recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of

Cash collateral deposits of

and

$403 million

with brokers under master netting arrangements are included in the fair value of the commodity derivatives reflected in Level 1 as of

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

, respectively. Certain of our commodity derivative contracts under master netting arrangements include both asset and liability positions. We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral asset or obligation under the column “Netting Adjustments” below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented on a gross basis in the tables below.



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

A description of our financial instruments and the valuation methods used to measure those instruments at fair value are as follows:

•

Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures and swaps, and as disclosed in

Note 21

, some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. These contracts are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but because they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

Physical purchase contracts to purchase inventories represent the fair value of firm commitments to purchase crude oil feedstocks and the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts, and as disclosed in

Note 21

, some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. The fair values of these firm commitments and purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange, but because these commitments have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, they are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

Investments of certain benefit plan assets consist of investment securities held by trusts for the purpose of satisfying a portion of our obligations under certain U.S. nonqualified benefit plans. The assets categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from national securities exchanges. The assets categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair value of which is provided by the insurer. Obligations of certain benefit plans relate to certain U.S. nonqualified defined contribution plans under which our obligations to eligible employees are equal to the fair value of the assets held by those plans.

•

Other investments consist of (i) equity securities of private companies over which we do not exercise significant influence nor whose financial statements are consolidated into our financial statements



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and (ii) debt securities of a private company whose financial statements are not consolidated into our financial statements. We have elected to account for these investments at their fair values. These investments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair values of these investments are determined using the income approach based on internally developed analyses.

•

Our biofuels blending obligation represents a liability for the purchase of RINs and RTFCs, as defined and described in

Note 21

under

“Compliance Program Price Risk,”

to satisfy our obligation to blend biofuels into the products we produce. Our obligation is based on our deficiency in RINs and RTFCs and the price of these instruments as of the balance sheet date. Our obligation is categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and is measured at fair value using the market approach based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances (in millions) for fair value measurements developed using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

For the year ended

December 31, 2009

, the amount reflected in “total losses included in income” in the table above related to the earn-out agreement are reported in “other income, net.” We entered into an earn-out agreement with Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008. We also entered into commodity derivative instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the earn-out agreement. The gains (losses) associated with these instruments are also reported in “other income, net.”

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

As of

December 31, 2011

and


, there were no assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Other Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that we recognize in our balance sheets at their carrying amounts include cash and temporary cash investments, receivables, payables, debt and capital lease obligations. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts, except for debt as shown in the table below (in millions):

The fair value of our debt is determined using the market approach based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1).

21.

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of commodities, the price of financial instruments associated with governmental and regulatory compliance programs, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, and we enter into derivative instruments to manage some of these risks. We also enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk on other contractual derivatives into which we have entered. The only types of derivative instruments we enter into are those related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, financial instruments we must purchase to maintain compliance with various governmental and regulatory programs, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below. All derivative instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see

Note 20

).

When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading derivative. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges (derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The cash flow effects of all of our derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities in our statements of cash flows for all periods presented.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, and options. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.

For risk management purposes, we use fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and economic hedges. In addition to the use of derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objective for entering into each type of hedge or trading derivative is described below.

Fair Value Hedges

Fair value hedges are used to hedge price volatility in certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories. The level of activity for our fair value hedges is based on the level of our operating inventories, and generally represents the amount by which our inventories differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels.

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into to hedge crude oil and refined product inventories and commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of crude oil and refined products at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels).



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Cash Flow Hedges

Cash flow hedges are used to hedge price volatility in certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. The objective of our cash flow hedges is to lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, product or natural gas purchases or refined product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable.

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases or sales of crude oil and refined products. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels).



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Economic Hedges

Economic hedges represent commodity derivative instruments that are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges and are used to manage price volatility in certain (i) refinery feedstock, refined product, and corn inventories, (ii) forecasted refinery feedstock, refined product, and corn purchases, and refined product sales, and (iii) fixed-price corn purchase contracts. Our objective for entering into economic hedges is consistent with the objectives discussed above for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. However, the economic hedges are not designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, usually due to the difficulty of establishing the required documentation at the date that the derivative instrument is entered into that would allow us to achieve “hedge deferral accounting.”

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into as economic hedges and commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of corn at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels, except those identified as corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels).



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Trading Derivatives

Our objective for entering into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes is to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into for trading purposes. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes represent thousands of barrels, except those identified as natural gas contracts that are presented in billions of British thermal units and corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels).

Compliance Program Price Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of financial instruments associated with various governmental and regulatory compliance programs that we must purchase in the open market to comply with these programs. These programs are described below.

Obligation to Blend Biofuels

We are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce in most of the countries in which we operate, and those countries set annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels that must be blended into the motor fuels consumed in these countries. As a producer of motor fuels from petroleum, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the applicable quota. To the degree we are unable to blend at the applicable rate in the U.S. and the U.K., we must purchase Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the U.S. and Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation certificates (RTFCs) in the U.K., and



VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

as such, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these financial instruments. We have not entered into derivative instruments to manage this risk, but we purchase RINs and RTFCs when the price of these instruments is deemed favorable.  For the years ended

December 31, 2011

,


, and


, the cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was

$231 million

,

$66 million

, and

$96 million

, respectively, and these amounts are reflected in cost of sales.

Maintaining Minimum Inventory Quantities

In the U.K., we are required to maintain a minimum quantity of refined products as a reserve against shortages or interruptions in the supply of these products. To the degree we decide not to physically hold the minimum quantity of these products, we must purchase Compulsory Stock Obligation (CSO) tickets from other suppliers of refined products in the U.K. or other European Union (EU) member countries, and we make economic decisions as to the cost of maintaining certain quantities of refined products versus the cost of purchasing CSO tickets. We have not entered into derivative instruments to manage the price volatility of CSO tickets. For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, the cost of purchasing CSO tickets to help meet our obligations under this compliance program was

$4 million

, and this amount was reflected in cost of sales. We had

no

obligations under this compliance program prior to completing the Pembroke Acquisition in 2011.

Emission Allowances

Our Pembroke Refinery is subject to a maximum amount of carbon dioxide that it can emit each year under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Under this cap-and-trade program, we purchase emission allowances on the open market for the difference between the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and the maximum amount allowed under the program. Therefore, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these allowances. For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, the cost of meeting our obligation under this compliance program was

$2 million

, and this amount is reflected in refining operating expenses. We had

no

obligations under this compliance program prior to completing the Pembroke Acquisition in 2011.

We enter into derivative instruments (futures) to reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows. Our positions in these derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. As of

December 31, 2011

, we had purchased futures contracts – long for

68,000

metric tons of EU emission allowances that were entered into as economic hedges. As of

December 31, 2011

, the fair value of these futures contracts was immaterial and therefore not separately presented in the table below under

“Fair Values of Derivative Instruments.”

For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, the loss recognized in income on these derivative instruments designated as economic hedges was also immaterial and therefore not separately presented in the table below under

“Effect of Derivative Instruments on Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.”

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, at times we have used interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed to floating interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of these operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, and therefore they are classified as economic hedges. As of

December 31, 2011

, we had commitments to purchase

$751 million

of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before

January 26, 2012

.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of

December 31, 2011

and


(in millions) and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See

Note 20

for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative instruments.

As indicated in

Note 20

, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts. In addition, in

Note 20

, we included cash collateral on deposit with or received from brokers in the fair value of the commodity derivatives; these cash amounts are not reflected in the tables below.

Market and Counterparty Risk

Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact our overall exposure to counterparty risk because these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, financial services companies are the counterparties in certain of our price risk management activities, and such financial services companies may be adversely affected by periods of uncertainty and illiquidity in the credit and capital markets.

As of

December 31, 2011

, we had net receivables related to derivative instruments of

$2 million

from counterparties in the refining industry and

no

amounts from counterparties in the financial services industry. As of

December 31, 2010

, we had net receivables related to derivative instruments of

$4 million

from counterparties in the refining industry and

$21 million

from counterparties in the financial services industry. These amounts represent the aggregate amount payable to us by companies in those industries, reduced by payables from us to those companies under master netting arrangements that allow for the setoff of amounts receivable from and payable to the same party. We do not require any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating.

Effect of Derivative Instruments on Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income

The following tables provide information about the gain or loss recognized in income and other comprehensive income on our derivative instruments and the line items in the financial statements in which such gains and losses are reflected (in millions).

For fair value hedges, no component of the derivative instruments’ gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for the years ended

December 31, 2011

, cash flow hedges primarily related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil, with

$19 million

of cumulative after-tax gains on cash flow hedges remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income. We estimate that

$19 million

of the deferred gains as of

December 31, 2011

will be reclassified into cost of sales over the next 12 months as a result of hedged transactions that are forecasted to occur. For the years ended

December 31, 2011

and


, there were no amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a result of the

discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting. For the year ended

December 31, 2009

, there were

$132 million

of pre-tax losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting. This amount, which is the amount classified as a loss from discontinued operations in the table, relates to the forecasted sales of distillates that did not occur due to the shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery.

The gain of

$29 million

on the other contract for the year ended

December 31, 2011

is related to the difference between the fair value of inventories acquired in connection with the Pembroke Acquisition and the amount paid for such inventories based on the terms of the purchase agreement. The loss of

$349 million

on commodity contracts for the year ended

December 31, 2011

includes a

$542 million

loss related to forward sales of refined products.
