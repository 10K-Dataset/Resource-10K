                         PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

     Valero Energy Corporation is one of the United States' largest 
independent refiners and marketers, and the largest on the Gulf Coast.  
With the May 1, 1997 acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., the Company 
now owns and operates four refineries in Texas and Louisiana with a combined
throughput capacity of approximately 530,000 barrels per day ("BPD").  
The Company principally produces premium, environmentally clean products 
such as reformulated gasoline, low-sulfur diesel and oxygenates.  The 
Company also produces a substantial slate of middle distillates, jet fuel 
and petrochemicals.  The Company markets its products in 32 states and 
selected export markets.  Unless otherwise required by the context, the 
term "Valero" as used herein refers to Valero Energy Corporation, and the
term "Company" refers to Valero and its consolidated subsidiaries.

     Valero was incorporated in Delaware in 1981 under the name Valero 
Refining and Marketing Company and became a publicly held corporation on 
July 31, 1997.  Its principal executive offices are located at 7990 West 
I.H. 10, San Antonio, Texas, 78230 and its telephone number is (210) 370-2000.

     For financial and statistical information regarding the Company's 
operations, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations."  For a discussion of cash flows provided by and
used in the Company's operations, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital 
Resources."

1997 Developments

Restructuring 

     Prior to July 31, 1997, Valero was a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero
Energy Corporation ("Energy").  Energy was a diversified energy company 
engaged in both the refining and marketing business and the natural gas 
related services business.  On July 31, 1997, pursuant to an agreement and 
plan of distribution between Valero and Energy (the "Distribution Agreement"),
Energy spun off Valero to Energy's stockholders by distributing all of 
Valero's $.01 par value common stock on a share for share basis to holders 
of record of Energy common stock at the close of business on July 31, 1997
(the "Distribution").  Immediately after the Distribution, Energy, with its
remaining natural gas related services business, merged (the "Merger")
with a wholly owned subsidiary of PG&E Corporation ("PG&E").  The completion
of the Distribution and the Merger (collectively referred to as the 
"Restructuring") finalized the restructuring of Energy previously announced
in January 1997.  The Distribution and the Merger were approved by Energy 
stockholders at their annual meeting held on June 18, 1997 and, in the 
opinion of Energy's outside counsel, were tax-free transactions.  Regulatory 
approval of the Merger was received from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission on July 16, 1997.  Upon completion of the Restructuring, Valero's
name was changed from Valero Refining and Marketing Company to Valero Energy
Corporation and its common stock was listed for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "VLO." 

     Immediately prior to the Distribution, the Company paid a dividend to 
Energy of  $210 million pursuant to the Distribution Agreement.  In addition,
the Company paid to Energy approximately $5 million in settlement of the 
intercompany note balance between the Company and Energy arising from certain
transactions during the period from January 1 through July 31, 1997.  In 
connection with the Merger, PG&E issued approximately 31 million shares of 
its common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding $1 par 
value common shares of Energy, and assumed $785.7 million of Energy's debt.  
Each Energy stockholder received .554 of one share of PG&E common stock, 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PCG," for each 
Energy share owned on July 31, 1997.  This fractional share amount was based
on the average price of PG&E common stock during a prescribed period 
preceding the closing of the transaction and the number of Energy shares 
issued and outstanding at the time of the closing. 

     Prior to the Restructuring, Energy, Valero and PG&E entered into a tax 
sharing agreement ("Tax Sharing Agreement"), which sets forth each party's 
rights and obligations with respect to payments and refunds, if any, of 
federal, state, local, or other taxes for periods before the Restructuring.  
In general, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Energy and Valero are each 
responsible for their allocable share of the federal, state and other taxes 
incurred by the combined operations of Energy and Valero prior to the 
Distribution.  Furthermore, Valero is responsible for substantially all 
tax liability in the event the Distribution or the Merger fails to qualify 
as a tax-free transaction, except that Energy would be responsible for any 
such tax liability attributable to certain actions by Energy and/or PG&E. 

     The separation of the Company from the natural gas business and 
operations of Energy was structured as a spin-off of the Company for legal, 
tax and other reasons.  However, the Company succeeded to certain important 
aspects of Energy's business, organization and affairs, namely:  (i) the
Company succeeded to the name "Valero Energy Corporation" and the Company 
retained the refining and marketing business of Energy which represented 
approximately one-half of the assets, revenues, and operating income of the 
businesses, operations and companies previously constituting Energy; (ii) the
Company's Board of Directors consists of those individuals formerly comprising 
Energy's Board of Directors; and (iii) the Company's executive management 
consists primarily of those individuals formerly comprising Energy's 
executive management.

Acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc.

     Effective May 1, 1997, Energy acquired all of the outstanding common 
stock of Basis Petroleum, Inc. ("Basis"), a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Salomon Inc ("Salomon").  The primary assets acquired with Basis include 
three refineries located in Texas City, Texas (the "Texas City Refinery"), 
Houston, Texas (the "Houston Refinery") and Krotz Springs, Louisiana (the 
"Krotz Springs Refinery") (these three refineries are collectively referred 
to as the "Acquired Refineries") and an extensive wholesale marketing 
business.  At the time of their acquisition, the Acquired Refineries had a 
combined total throughput capacity in excess of 300,000 BPD.  Prior to the 
Restructuring, Energy transferred the stock of Basis to Valero.  As a 
result, Basis was a part of the Company at the time it was spun off to 
Energy's stockholders pursuant to the Restructuring.  Basis' name was 
subsequently changed to Valero Refining Company-Texas and the Basis assets 
located in Louisiana were transferred to a newly-formed subsidiary of the 
Company, Valero Refining Company-Louisiana.  Energy acquired the capital 
stock of Basis for approximately $470 million which includes certain 
post-closing adjustments and settlements.  The purchase price was paid,
in part, with 3,429,796 shares of Energy common stock having a fair market 
value of approximately $114 million with the remainder paid in cash from 
borrowings under Energy's bank credit facilities.  In addition, Salomon is 
entitled to receive earn-out payments from the Company in any of the years
through 2007 if certain average refining margins during any of those years 
are above a specified level. Any payments under this earn-out arrangement 
are limited to $35 million in any year and $200 million in the aggregate 
and are determined on May 1 of  each year beginning in 1998.

     For additional information concerning the Company's financing activities,
see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refining Operations

     The Company owns and operates four refineries located in the U.S. Gulf 
Coast region having a combined total refining capacity of approximately 
530,000 BPD, net of inter-refinery transfers averaging approximately 
35,000 BPD.  The Company's largest refinery is located on 254 acres in 
Corpus Christi, Texas (the "Corpus Christi Refinery") along the Corpus 
Christi Ship Channel and has a feedstock throughput capacity of 
approximately 190,000 BPD.  The Texas City Refinery is located on 
290 acres along the Texas City Ship Channel and has a feedstock throughput 
capacity of approximately 180,000 BPD. The Houston Refinery is located on 
250 acres along the Houston Ship Channel with a feedstock throughput 
capacity of approximately 115,000 BPD.  The Krotz Springs Refinery is 
located on 260 acres in Southern Louisiana along the Atchafalaya River 
which has access to the Mississippi River and to the Colonial pipeline.  
The feedstock throughput capacity of the Krotz Springs Refinery is 
approximately 80,000 BPD.

     In addition to more than tripling the Company's throughput capacity, the
Acquired Refineries have substantially diversified the Company's feedstock 
slate, allowing it to process both medium sour crude oils and heavy sweet 
crudes, both of which can typically be purchased at a discount to West Texas 
Intermediate ("WTI"), a benchmark crude oil.  The Company's primary feedstocks
are medium sour crude oil, heavy sweet crude oil and high-sulfur atmospheric 
residual fuel oil ("resid").

     In 1998, the Company plans to begin a capital expenditure program that 
targets a system wide increase in total throughput capacity of approximately 
140,000 BPD by early to mid-2000.  The Company currently estimates the cost 
of this expansion to be $250-275 million in the aggregate.  The majority 
of these capital expenditures are anticipated to be spent in 1999 on 
upgrades and modifications to the Acquired Refineries and will be performed
during scheduled maintenance turnarounds.  In addition to capital 
expenditures related to this expansion program, other capital expenditures 
are planned to improve system reliability and reduce emissions.  

     The Company has very few turnarounds scheduled for 1998.  During 1999,
maintenance turnarounds for most of the Company's major refining units 
are planned.  Such turnarounds are scheduled to occur early in the first
quarter and in the fourth quarter when refining margins are historically
low so as to minimize the impact on the Company's operating results.

Corpus Christi Refinery

     The Corpus Christi Refinery specializes in processing primarily resid 
and heavy crude oil into premium products, such as reformulated gasoline 
("RFG").  The Corpus Christi Refinery can produce approximately 117,000 BPD 
of  gasoline and gasoline-related products, 35,000 BPD of middle distillates 
and 40,000 BPD of other products such as chemicals, asphalt and propane.  
The Corpus Christi Refinery can produce all of its gasoline as RFG and all of 
its diesel fuel as low-sulfur diesel.  The Corpus Christi Refinery has 
substantial flexibility to vary its mix of gasoline products to meet changing 
market conditions. 

     The Corpus Christi Refinery produces oxygenates  such as MTBE (methyl
tertiary butyl ether) and TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether).   MTBE is an 
oxygen-rich, high-octane gasoline blendstock produced by reacting methanol 
and isobutylene, and is used to manufacture oxygenated and reformulated 
gasolines. TAME, like MTBE, is an oxygen-rich, high-octane gasoline 
blendstock.  The butane upgrade facility which produces MTBE (the "Corpus 
Christi MTBE Plant") is located at the Corpus Christi Refinery and can 
produce approximately 17,000 BPD of MTBE from butane and methanol feedstocks.
The MTBE/TAME Unit at the Corpus Christi Refinery converts light olefin 
streams produced by the refinery's heavy oil cracker ("HOC") into MTBE and 
TAME.  The Corpus Christi MTBE Plant and MTBE/TAME Unit enable the Corpus 
Christi Refinery to produce approximately 22,500 BPD of oxygenates, which 
are blended into the Company's own gasoline production and sold separately.  
Substantially all of the methanol feedstocks required for the production of 
oxygenates at the Corpus Christi Refinery can normally be provided by a 
methanol plant in Clear Lake, Texas owned by a joint venture between a 
Valero subsidiary and Hoechst Celanese Chemical Group, Inc. (the "Clear Lake 
Methanol Plant"). 

[FN]
  "Oxygenates" are liquid hydrocarbon compounds containing oxygen.  
       Gasoline that contains oxygenates usually has lower carbon monoxide
       emissions than conventional gasoline.

     In January 1997, a mixed xylene fractionation facility ("Xylene Unit"), 
which recovers the mixed xylene stream from the Corpus Christi Refinery's 
reformate stream, was placed into service at the refinery.  The fractionated 
xylene is sold into the petrochemical feedstock market for use in the 
production of paraxylene.  The Corpus Christi MTBE Plant, the MTBE/TAME 
Unit, the Xylene Unit and related facilities diversify the Corpus Christi 
Refinery's operations, giving the Company the flexibility to pursue 
higher-margin product markets.  

     In 1997, the Company completed a scheduled turnaround on the crude unit 
at the Corpus Christi Refinery.  The Company also completed a scheduled 
turnaround of certain of the Corpus Christi Refinery's major refining units 
in the first quarter of 1998.  Modifications made during the 1998 turnaround 
are expected to increase throughput by 5,000 to 10,000 BPD, depending upon 
the type of feedstocks utilized.  In addition, the hydrodesulfurization unit 
("HDS") was modified to allow for the processing of approximately 25,000 BPD
of high sulfur crude oil, thereby increasing the Corpus Christi Refinery's 
feedstock flexibility.  The Corpus Christi Refinery experienced one 
significant unscheduled shutdown of its HOC during the second quarter 
resulting in a reduction of operating income for 1997 of approximately 
$8 million.  During this shutdown, certain debottlenecking modifications 
were completed which have increased the capacity of the HOC by approximately 
3,000 BPD.  Other than the HOC downtime, the Corpus Christi Refinery's 
principal refining units operated during 1997 without significant unscheduled 
downtime.  No further turnaround activity is scheduled for the Corpus Christi 
Refinery during 1998.  During 1999, the HOC is scheduled to be down for a 
maintenance turnaround and to increase the unit's capacity and the HDS is 
scheduled to be down for a maintenance turnaround and to replace the catalyst 
in the unit.

Acquired Refineries

     The acquisition of the Acquired Refineries significantly diversified 
the Company's asset base and expanded and diversified its feedstock slate.  
At the time of their acquisition, the Acquired Refineries had a combined 
total throughput capacity of approximately 300,000 BPD.  As a result of 
upgrading and reconfiguration activities undertaken by the Company, the 
aggregate throughput capacity of the Acquired Refineries has been increased 
to approximately 340,000 BPD, net of inter-refinery transfers averaging 
approximately 35,000 BPD.  Much of this increased capacity has resulted 
from efforts to optimize feedstock selection in order to capitalize on the 
reconfiguration of the Acquired Refineries.  In 1998, the Company plans to 
begin a capital expenditure program designed to increase total system 
capacity of the Acquired Refineries by converting the fluid catalytic 
cracking units ("FCC Units") to HOCs and increasing their capacity, 
expanding the crude unit capacities and various other expenditures to 
enhance feedstock flexibility.  In addition, expenditures to upgrade 
instrumentation systems and modernize the control rooms at each of the 
Acquired Refineries will continue over the next few years to improve plant 
efficiency and management information systems.

        Texas City Refinery

     The Texas City Refinery is capable of refining lower-value, medium sour 
crudes into a slate of gasolines, low-sulfur diesels and distillates, 
including home heating oil, kerosene and jet fuel.  The Texas City Refinery 
typically produces approximately 55,000 BPD of gasoline and 60,000 BPD of 
distillates.  The Texas City Refinery also  provides approximately 35,000 BPD 
of intermediate feedstocks such as deasphalted oil to the Corpus Christi 
Refinery and the Houston Refinery.  The Texas City Refinery typically 
receives its feedstocks and ships product by tanker via deep water docking 
facilities along the Texas City Ship Channel, and also has access to the 
Colonial, Explorer and TEPPCO pipelines for distribution of its products.

     During the latter part of 1996, a Residfiner (which improves the 
cracking characteristics of the feedstocks for the FCC Unit), and a Residual 
Oil Supercritical Extraction ("ROSE") unit (which recovers deasphalted oil 
from the vacuum tower bottoms for feed to the FCC Unit) were placed in 
service at the Texas City Refinery, which significantly enhanced this 
refinery's feedstock flexibility and product diversity.  Certain intermediate 
products produced from these units are also being utilized as feedstocks at 
the Corpus Christi and Houston Refineries.

     During 1997, the Texas City Refinery's principal refining units 
operated without significant unscheduled downtime.  A scheduled turnaround 
was completed on the Residfiner in July 1997.  During 1998, the Residfiner 
is scheduled for a maintenance turnaround.  During 1999, the FCC Unit, the 
crude unit, Residfiner and ROSE unit are scheduled to be down for 
maintenance turnarounds.  At that time, the FCC Unit will be converted to 
a heavy oil cracker and its capacity increased.  The capacity of the crude 
unit will also be increased at that time.

     Houston Refinery

     The Houston Refinery is capable of processing heavy sweet or medium 
sour crude oil and produces approximately 54,000 BPD of gasoline and 
37,000 BPD of distillates. The refinery typically receives its feedstocks 
via tanker at deep water docking facilities along the Houston Ship Channel.
This facility also has access to major product pipelines, including the 
Colonial, Explorer and TEPPCO pipelines.

     The Houston Refinery experienced unplanned shutdowns of its FCC Unit 
during the second and fourth quarters of 1997 for approximately 11 and 14
days, respectively, in order to make certain repairs and to replace a section 
of its regenerator.  Other than the FCC Unit repairs, the Houston Refinery's 
primary refining units operated during 1997 without significant unscheduled 
downtime.  No turnaround activity is scheduled for the Houston Refinery 
during 1998.  During 1999, the FCC Unit, the crude unit and the ROSE Unit are
scheduled to be down for maintenance turnarounds.  At that time, the FCC Unit
will be converted to a heavy oil cracker and its capacity increased.  The
capacity of the crude unit will also be increased at that time.

     Krotz Springs Refinery

     The Krotz Springs Refinery processes primarily local, light Louisiana 
sweet crude oil and produces approximately 34,000 BPD of gasoline and 
38,000 BPD of distillates.  As a result of recent modifications to its 
FCC Unit, the Krotz Springs Refinery is also capable of processing resid.  
The refinery is geographically located to benefit from access to upriver 
markets on the Mississippi River and it has docking facilities along the 
Atchafalaya River sufficiently deep to allow barge and light ship access.  
The facility is also connected to the Colonial pipeline for product 
transportation to the Southeast and Northeast.  This refinery was built 
during the 1979-1982 time period making it, like the Corpus Christi Refinery, 
a relatively new facility compared to other Gulf Coast refineries.  This 
refinery also benefits from recently added MTBE/polymerization and 
isomerization units.

     The Krotz Springs Refinery's principal operating units operated during 
1997 without significant unscheduled downtime.  No turnaround activity is 
scheduled for the Krotz Springs Refinery during 1998.  During 1999, the 
crude unit is scheduled to be down for a maintenance turnaround and to 
increase the unit's capacity.

Selected Operating Results

     The following table sets forth certain consolidated operating results 
for the last three fiscal years.  Amounts for 1997 include the results of 
operations of the Acquired Refineries from May 1, 1997.  Average throughput 
margin per barrel is computed by subtracting total direct product cost of 
sales from product sales revenues and dividing the result by throughput 
volumes. 



     For additional information regarding the Company's operating results for 
the three years ended December 31, 1997, see "Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Marketing

     The Company's product slate is presently comprised of approximately 90% 
gasoline and related components, distillates, chemicals and other light 
products.  The Company sells refined products under spot and term contracts 
to bulk and truck rack customers at over 170 locations in 32 states throughout 
the United States and selected export markets in Latin America. As a result 
of the Basis acquisition, total product sales volumes increased from 
approximately 291,000 BPD during 1996 to approximately 630,000 BPD during 
1997.  Sales volumes include amounts produced at the Company's refineries and
amounts purchased from third parties and resold in connection with the 
Company's marketing activities.  Currently, the Company markets approximately 
170,000 BPD of gasoline and distillates through truck rack facilities.  
Other sales are made to large oil companies and gasoline distributors and 
transported by pipeline, barges and tankers.  The principal purchasers of 
the Company's products from truck racks have been wholesalers and jobbers 
in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and Gulf Coast.  No single purchaser 
of the Company's products accounted for more than 10% of total sales during 
1997.  With its access to the Gulf of Mexico, the Company's refineries are 
able to ship refined products to Latin American markets and the West Coast.
Interconnects with common-carrier pipelines give the Company the flexibility
to sell products in most major geographic regions of the United States.

     Approximately 40,000 BPD of the Company's RFG production is under 
contract to supply wholesale gasoline marketers in Texas at market-related 
prices.  In 1997, the Company also supplied approximately 1.5 million 
barrels of CARB Phase II gasoline to West Coast markets in connection 
with the commencement of California Air Resources Board's gasoline program.
The Company expects demand for RFG to continue to improve as a result of 
increased demand in areas currently designated as non-attainment and more 
cities across the United States "opting in" to the federal RFG program.  For 
further discussion, see "Factors Affecting Operating Results" and "Outlook" 
under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations."  

Feedstock Supply

     The acquisition of the Acquired Refineries expanded and diversified 
the slate of feedstocks which the Company can process.  Prior to the Basis 
acquisition, the Company's primary feedstock was resid processed at the 
Corpus Christi Refinery.  Approximately 70% of the Company's feedstock slate 
is now comprised of medium sour crude oil, heavy sweet crude oil and resid.  
The remaining feedstocks are primarily comprised of intermediates, light 
sweet crude oil, methanol and butane.

     The Company has term feedstock contracts totaling approximately 
300,000 BPD, or approximately 57% of its total feedstock requirements.  
The remainder of its feedstock requirements are purchased on the spot 
market.  The term agreements include contracts to purchase medium sour 
crude oil and resid from various foreign national oil companies, including 
certain Middle Eastern suppliers, and various domestic integrated oil 
companies.

     In connection with the Distribution, the Company entered into several 
contracts with its former affiliates, including a 10-year term contract 
under which a former affiliate is to supply approximately 50% of the butane 
required to operate the Corpus Christi MTBE Plant and natural gasoline for 
blending.  The Company obtains approximately 80% of its total methanol 
requirements for all of its refineries through its 50% joint venture 
interest in the Clear Lake Methanol Plant.

     The Company owns feedstock and refined product storage facilities and 
leases feedstock and refined product storage facilities in various locations.
The Company believes its storage facilities are generally adequate for its
refining and marketing operations.

Factors Affecting Operating Results

     The Company's earnings and cash flow from operations are primarily 
affected by the relationship between refined product prices and the prices 
for crude oil and resid.  The cost to acquire feedstocks and the price for 
which refined products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors 
beyond the Company's control, including the supply and demand for crude 
oil, gasoline and other refined products which in turn are dependent upon, 
among other things, the availability of imports, the economies and production 
levels of foreign suppliers, the marketing of competitive fuels, political 
affairs and the extent of governmental regulation.

     The prices received by the Company for its refined products are 
affected by other factors, such as product pipeline capacity, local market 
conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries.  As a result of 
the geographic location of the Company's refineries, the Company's 
profitability is largely dependent upon Gulf Coast refining margins.  
A large, rapid increase in crude oil prices or a decrease in refined product
prices in the Gulf Coast region could adversely affect the Company's 
operating margins.  Crude oil costs and the price of refined products have 
historically been subject to wide fluctuation.  Installation of additional 
refinery crude distillation and upgrading facilities, price volatility, 
international political developments and other factors beyond the control of 
the Company are likely to continue to play an important role in refining 
industry economics.  The Company is aware, for example, of additional 
capacity of up to 200,000 BPD from a refinery in Good Hope, Louisiana 
which may become operational as early as late 1998.   These factors can 
impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market resulting 
in price volatility.  Moreover, the industry typically experiences seasonal 
fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as for gasoline during the
summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter in the
Northeast.

     A significant portion of the Company's feedstock supplies are secured 
under term contracts.  There is no assurance of renewal of such contracts 
upon their expiration or that economically equivalent substitute supply 
contracts can be secured.  The term agreements include an agreement with 
the Saudi Arabian Oil Company to provide an average of 36,000 BPD of resid 
from its Ras Tanura refinery to the Company through mid-1998.  The Saudi 
Arabian Oil Company has advised the Company that it plans to begin
operation of certain new resid conversion units in 1998 at the Ras Tanura 
refining complex in Saudi Arabia.  As a result, the production of resid at 
Ras Tanura for export would be significantly reduced, which could adversely
affect the price, terms or availability of high quality resid feedstocks in 
the future.  However, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company has indicated that they 
are willing to provide an additional supply of resid to the Company from 
their other refineries although no contract has yet been negotiated.  The 
availability of such supplies notwithstanding, the Company anticipates that 
lower volumes of high quality resid will be available from Saudi Arabia in 
the future.

     The Company's feedstock supplies from international producers  are 
loaded aboard chartered vessels and are subject to the usual maritime 
hazards.   If the Company's foreign sources of crude oil or access to the 
marine system for delivering crude oil were curtailed, the Company's 
operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, the loss of, or 
an adverse change in the terms of, certain of its feedstock supply 
agreements or the loss of sources or means of delivery of its feedstock 
supplies, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating 
results.  The volatility of prices and quantities of feedstocks that may 
be purchased on the spot market or pursuant to term contracts could also 
have a material adverse effect on operating results.

     Because the Company manufactures a substantial portion of its gasoline 
as RFG and can produce approximately 26,000 BPD of total oxygenates, certain 
federal and state clean-fuel programs significantly affect the operations of 
the Company and the markets in which it sells its refined products.  In the 
future, the Company cannot control or with certainty predict the effect of 
such clean-fuel programs on the cost to manufacture, demand for or supply 
of refined products.  Presently, the EPA's oxygenated fuel program under 
the Clean Air Act requires that areas designated "nonattainment" for carbon 
monoxide use gasoline that contains a prescribed amount of clean burning 
oxygenates during certain winter months.  Additionally, the EPA's RFG 
program under the Clean Air Act requires year-round usage of RFG in areas 
designated "extreme" or "severe" nonattainment for ozone.  In addition to 
these nonattainment areas, approximately 44 of the 87 areas that were 
designated as "serious," "moderate" or "marginal" nonattainment for ozone
also "opted in" to the RFG program to decrease their emissions of 
hydrocarbons and toxic pollutants.  In 1996, California adopted a statewide, 
year-round program requiring the use of gasoline that meets more restrictive 
emissions specifications than the federally mandated RFG.  Under the 
California gasoline program, the entire state is required to use CARB 
Phase II gasoline that meets the California emissions standards which 
are higher than those set by the EPA.  Based upon oxygenate supply and demand
data, it appears most California refiners are choosing to use oxygenates to 
help them comply with the statewide emissions standards.  In 1997, Phoenix, 
Arizona adopted a year-round program requiring gasoline that meets either 
the federal RFG standards or the CARB Phase II standards.  For the first 
time in many years, Phoenix had no ozone exceedances in 1997.  Because 
Phoenix previously used oxygenated gasoline only in the winter months 
for carbon monoxide control, the Company estimates this change will increase 
annualized U.S. oxygenate demand about one percent.  

     MTBE margins are affected by the price of MTBE and its feedstocks, 
methanol and butane, as well as the demand for RFG, oxygenated gasoline and 
premium gasoline.  The worldwide movement to reduce lead in gasoline is 
expected to increase worldwide demand for oxygenates to replace the octane 
provided by lead-based compounds.  The general United States growth in 
gasoline demand as well as additional "opt-ins" by certain areas into the 
EPA clean fuels programs are expected to continue to increase the demand for 
MTBE as a component of these clean fuels.  However, initiatives have been 
presented in California which would restrict or potentially ban the use of 
MTBE as a gasoline component.  Based on available information, the Company 
believes that numerous scientific studies commissioned by the EPA, CARB and 
others will result in defeat of these initiatives.  However, if MTBE were 
to be restricted or banned, the Company believes that its MTBE-producing 
facility could be modified to produce a product similar to alkylate or other 
petrochemicals.

     The Corpus Christi Refinery's operating results are affected by the 
relationship between refined product prices and resid prices, which in turn 
are largely determined by market forces.  The price of resid is affected by 
the relationship between the demand for refined products (increased refined
products demand increases crude oil demand, thereby increasing the supply of 
resid as more crude oil is processed) and worldwide additions to resid 
conversion capacity (which reduces the available supply of resid).  The crude 
oil and refined products markets typically experience periods of extreme price
volatility.  During such periods, disproportionate changes in the prices of 
refined products and resid usually occur.  The potential impact of changing 
crude oil and refined product prices on the Corpus Christi Refinery's results 
of operations is further affected by the fact that the Company generally 
buys a portion of its resid feedstocks approximately 45 to 50 days prior to 
processing.  

     Because the Company's refineries are generally more complex than many 
conventional refineries and are designed principally to process resid and 
other heavy and/or sour crude oils, its operating costs per barrel are 
generally higher than those of most conventional refiners.  But because the
Company's primary feedstocks usually sell at discounts to benchmark crude oil, 
it has been generally able to recover its higher operating costs and generate 
higher margins than many conventional refiners that use lighter crude oil as 
their principal feedstock.  Moreover, through recent improvements in 
technology and modifications to its operating units, the Company has improved
its ability to process different types of feedstocks, including synthetic 
domestic heavy oil blends and heavy crude oils.  The Company expects its 
primary feedstocks to continue to sell at a discount to benchmark crude oil, 
but is unable to predict future relationships between the supply of and 
demand for its feedstocks.

     In April 1995, six major oil refiners filed a lawsuit against Unocal 
Corporation ("Unocal") in Los Angeles, California seeking a declaratory 
judgment that Unocal's claimed patent on certain gasoline compositions was 
invalid and unenforceable.  The Company is not a party to this litigation.
Unocal's claimed patent covers a substantial portion of the reformulated 
gasoline compositions required by the CARB Phase II regulations that went
into effect in March 1996.  In October 1997, a federal court jury upheld
the validity of Unocal's patent.  In November 1997, the jury awarded 
Unocal royalty damages based on infringement of the patent.  A final phase 
of the trial involving the unenforceability of Unocal's patent due to 
"inequitable conduct" was held in December 1997, but to date, no decision 
on this issue has been reached.  Any adverse judgment against the six oil
refiners will likely be appealed.  If the Company were required to pay a 
royalty on the compositions claimed by Unocal's patent, such amounts could 
affect the operating results of the Company and alter the blending economics 
for compositions not covered by the patent.  The Company is unable to 
predict the validity or effect of any claimed Unocal patent.

Competition

     Many of the Company's competitors in the petroleum industry are fully 
integrated companies engaged, on a national and/or international basis, in 
many segments of the petroleum business, including exploration, production, 
transportation, refining and marketing on scales much larger than the 
Company's.  Such competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to 
or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of such segments.  
Substantially all of the Company's crude oil and feedstock supplies are 
purchased from third party sources, while some competitors have proprietary
sources of crude oil available for their own refineries.

     The refining industry is highly competitive with respect to both 
feedstock supply and marketing.   The Company competes with numerous other 
companies for available supplies of resid and other feedstocks and for 
outlets for its refined products.  Many of the Company's competitors 
obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned 
production and are able to dispose of refined products at their own 
retail outlets.  The Company does not have retail gasoline operations.  
Competitors that have their own production or retail outlets (and 
brand-name recognition) may be able to offset losses from refining 
operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and 
may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining 
margins or feedstock shortages.  

     The Company expects a continuation of the trend of industry 
restructuring and consolidation through mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, 
joint ventures and similar transactions, making for a more competitive 
business environment while providing the Company with opportunities to 
expand its operations.  As described above, the Company expects to 
undertake a capital expansion program to increase the throughput capacity 
of its refinery facilities by approximately 140,000 BPD, and increase their 
operational flexibility.  The Company also plans to continue evaluating and 
pursuing potential acquisitions to add refining capacity, in any case, 
depending upon the Company's assessment of an acquisition's potential for 
accretive earnings, creating geographic diversity, providing enhanced 
marketing opportunities and providing economies of scope and scale.

Environmental Matters

     The Company's operations are subject to environmental regulation by 
federal, state and local authorities, including but not limited to, the EPA, 
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission ("TNRCC") and the 
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.  The regulatory requirements 
relate primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste 
management and pollution prevention measures.  Several of the more 
significant federal laws applicable to the Company's operations include 
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
("RCRA").  The Clean Air Act establishes stringent criteria for regulating 
conventional air pollutants as well as toxic pollutants at operating 
facilities in addition to requiring refiners to market cleaner-burning 
gasoline in specific regions of the country to reduce ozone forming 
pollutants and toxic emissions.

     CERCLA and RCRA, and related state law, subject the Company to the 
potential obligation to remove or mitigate the environmental impact of the 
disposal or release of certain pollutants at the Company's facilities and 
at formerly owned sites.  Under CERCLA, the Company is subject to potential 
joint and several liability for the costs of remediation at "superfund" 
sites at which it has been identified as a "potentially responsible party" 
(a "PRP").  Pursuant to the terms of the Basis acquisition, Salomon agreed 
to indemnify the Company from third party claims, including "superfund" 
liability associated with any pre-closing activities with respect to the 
Acquired Refineries, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations.  
As of December 31, 1997, the Company has not been designated as a PRP under 
CERCLA for any sites or costs not covered by Salomon's indemnity.

     Because the Corpus Christi Refinery was completed in 1984, it was 
built under more stringent environmental requirements than many existing 
refineries.  The Corpus Christi Refinery currently meets EPA emissions 
standards requiring the use of "best available control technology," and 
is located in an area currently designated "attainment" for air quality.  
Accordingly, the Corpus Christi Refinery may be able to comply with the 
Clean Air Act and future environmental legislation more easily than older 
refineries, and significant additional capital expenditures for environmental 
compliance are not anticipated.  In 1996, the Corpus Christi, Texas, area was 
approved as a "flexible attainment region" ("FAR") by the EPA and the TNRCC.  
Under the Clean Air Act, the FAR designation will allow local officials 
to design and implement an ozone prevention strategy customized for the 
community.  This designation also prevents the EPA from designating the 
Corpus Christi area as "nonattainment" for a five-year period while 
agreed-upon control strategies are being initiated to reduce ozone 
formation.  The FAR designation should provide greater flexibility with 
respect to possible future expansion projects at the Corpus Christi Refinery.

     The Company is leading an industry initiative in the State of Texas to 
voluntarily permit "grandfathered" emissions sources at the Houston and 
Texas City Refineries by utilizing a flexible permitting process.  The 
flexible permit is a new permitting concept in Texas that allows companies 
that have committed to install advanced pollution control technology greater 
operational flexibility, including increased throughput capacities, as long 
as a facility-wide emissions cap is not exceeded.

     As part of the Company's efforts to convert all of its Texas refineries 
to flexible permits and utilize "best available pollution control technology"
at all its refineries, the Company plans to install flue gas scrubbers on the
FCC Units at the Houston and Texas City Refineries and upgrade its waste 
water treatment plants at the Houston and Corpus Christi Refineries.  The 
Company anticipates spending approximately $50 million in connection with 
these efforts over the next two years.  These expenditures are not included 
in the estimate of capital expenditures to increase capacity discussed above
under the heading "Refining Operations."

     In 1997, capital expenditures for the Company attributable to compliance 
with environmental regulations were approximately $15 million and are 
currently estimated to be $21 million for 1998 (including expenditures at 
the Acquired Refineries).  These amounts are exclusive of any amounts 
related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures 
relating to compliance with environmental regulations is not determinable.

     Governmental regulations are complex and subject to different 
interpretations.  Therefore, future action and regulatory initiatives 
could result in changes to expected operating permits, additional remedial 
actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot 
be assessed with certainty at this time.  There are no material governmental 
fines or corrective action requirements associated with the Company's 
operations and the Company believes its operations are in substantial 
compliance with current and applicable environmental laws and regulations.

See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Litigation Relating to Operations of Basis Prior to Acquisition

     Basis has been named as a party to numerous claims and legal proceedings 
which arose prior to its acquisition by the Company.  Pursuant to the Stock 
Purchase Agreement between Energy, the Company, Salomon, and Basis, Salomon 
assumed the defense of all known suits, actions, claims and investigations 
pending at the time of the acquisition and all obligations, liabilities and 
expenses related to or arising therefrom.  In addition, Salomon agreed to 
assume all obligations, liabilities and expenses related to or resulting 
from all private third-party suits, actions and claims which arise out of 
a state of facts existing on or prior to the time of the acquisition 
(including "superfund" liability), but which were not pending at such time, 
subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations.  In certain pending 
matters, the plaintiffs are requesting injunctive relief which, if granted, 
could potentially result in the operations acquired in connection with the 
purchase of Basis being adversely affected through required reductions in 
emissions, discharges or refinery throughput, which could be outside 
Salomon's indemnity obligations.  The Company and Salomon reached an 
agreement in December 1997 whereby Salomon paid the Company $9.5 million 
in settlement of certain of Salomon's contingent environmental obligations 
assumed under the Stock Purchase Agreement.  This settlement did not affect
Salomon's other indemnity obligations described in this paragraph.

Litigation Relating to Discontinued Operations

     Energy and certain of its natural gas related subsidiaries, as well as 
the Company, have been sued by Teco Pipeline Company ("Teco") regarding the 
operation of the 340-mile West Texas pipeline in which a subsidiary of 
Energy holds a 50% undivided interest.  In 1985, a subsidiary of Energy 
sold a 50% undivided interest in the pipeline and entered into a joint 
venture through an ownership agreement and an operating agreement, each 
dated February 28, 1985, with the purchaser of the interest.  In 1988, 
Teco succeeded to that purchaser's 50% interest.  A subsidiary of Energy 
has at all times been the operator of the pipeline.  Notwithstanding the 
written ownership and operating agreements, the plaintiff alleges that a 
separate, unwritten partnership agreement exists, and that the defendants 
have exercised improper dominion over such alleged partnership's affairs.  
The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants acted in bad faith by 
negatively affecting the economics of the joint venture in order to provide 
financial advantages to facilities or entities owned by the defendants and 
by allegedly usurping for the defendants' own benefit certain opportunities 
available to the joint venture.  The plaintiff asserts causes of action for 
breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, tortious interference with business
relationships, professional malpractice and other claims, and seeks 
unquantified actual and punitive damages.  Energy's motion to compel 
arbitration was denied, but Energy has filed an appeal.  Energy has also 
filed a counterclaim alleging that the plaintiff breached its own 
obligations to the joint venture and jeopardized the economic and 
operational viability of the pipeline by its actions.  Energy is seeking 
unquantified actual and punitive damages.  Although PG&E previously acquired 
Teco and now ultimately owns both Teco and Energy after the Restructuring, 
PG&E's Teco acquisition agreement purports to assign the benefit or 
detriment of this lawsuit to the former shareholders of Teco.  Pursuant 
to the Distribution Agreement by which the Company was spun off to Energy's
stockholders in connection with the Restructuring, the Company has agreed to 
indemnify and hold harmless Energy with respect to this lawsuit to the 
extent of 50% of the amount of any final judgment or settlement amount 
not in excess of $30 million, and 100% of that part of any final judgment or
settlement amount in excess of $30 million.  

General

     The Company is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings 
arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes it is 
unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to 
which the Company is a party would have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's financial statements; however, due to the inherent uncertainty 
of litigation, the range of possible loss, if any, cannot be estimated with 
a reasonable degree of precision and there can be no assurance that the 
resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have an adverse 
effect on the Company's results of operations for the interim period in 
which such resolution occurred.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the 
fourth quarter of 1997.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     
RESTRUCTURING

     On July 31, 1997, Valero Energy Corporation ("Energy") completed the 
spin-off of its refining and marketing subsidiary, Valero Refining and 
Marketing Company, to its shareholders and the merger of its natural gas 
related services business with PG&E Corporation ("PG&E")(collectively 
referred to as the "Restructuring").  Upon completion of the Restructuring, 
Valero Refining and Marketing Company was renamed Valero Energy Corporation 
("Valero," and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company") 
and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VLO."  The 
Restructuring was the result of a management recommendation announced in 
November 1996 to pursue strategic alternatives involving Energy's principal 
business activities.  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information about the Restructuring.

     For financial reporting purposes under the federal securities laws, 
Valero is a "successor registrant" to Energy.  As a result, the following 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations, and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere 
herein reflect Energy's natural gas related services business as 
discontinued operations of the Company.  As the context requires, 
references to "Energy" are to (i) Valero Energy Corporation and its 
consolidated subsidiaries, both individually and collectively, for all 
periods prior to the close of business on July 31, 1997, the effective 
date of the Restructuring, and (ii) the natural gas related services 
business which was merged with PG&E for all periods subsequent to 
July 31, 1997. The following review of the Company's results of operations 
and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction 
with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto of the
Company presented on pages 30 to 64.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

     In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 128, 
"Earnings per Share," which became effective for the Company's financial 
statements beginning with the period ending December 31, 1997.  This 
statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 15, "Earnings per Share," and 
related interpretations and establishes new standards for computing and 
presenting earnings per share, requiring a dual presentation for companies 
with complex capital structures.  In accordance with this new statement, 
the Company has presented basic and diluted earnings per share on the 
face of the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  References 
to "per share" amounts in the following discussion of Results of Operations 
are to basic earnings per share. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The following discussion contains certain estimates, predictions, 
projections and other "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning 
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and uncertainties.
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they 
are based, are made in good faith and reflect the Company's current judgment 
regarding the direction of its business, actual results will almost always 
vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections,
assumptions, or other future performance suggested herein.  Some important 
factors (but not necessarily all factors) that could affect the Company's 
sales volumes, growth strategies, future profitability and operating results, 
or that otherwise could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed in any forward-looking statement include the following:  renewal 
or satisfactory replacement of the Company's residual oil ("resid") feedstock 
arrangements as well as market, political or other forces generally affecting 
the pricing and availability of resid and other refinery feedstocks and 
refined products; accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting the 
Company's, its suppliers' or its customers' pipelines, plants, machinery or 
equipment; excess industry capacity; competition from products and services
offered by other energy enterprises; changes in the cost or availability of 
third-party vessels, pipelines and other means of transporting feedstocks 
and products; ability to implement the cost reductions and operational 
changes related to, and realize the various assumptions and efficiencies 
projected for, the operation of the Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs 
refineries; state and federal environmental, economic, safety and other 
policies and regulations, any changes therein, and any legal or regulatory 
delays or other factors beyond the Company's control; execution of planned 
capital projects; weather conditions affecting the Company's operations or 
the areas in which the Company's products are marketed; rulings, judgments, 
or settlements in litigation or other legal matters, including unexpected 
environmental remediation costs in excess of any reserves; the introduction 
or enactment of federal or state legislation; and changes in the credit 
ratings assigned to the Company's debt securities and trade credit.  
Certain of these risk factors are more fully discussed in the Company's 
Form S-1 registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on May 13, 1997 ("Form S-1").  The Company undertakes no 
obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such 
forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or 
circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of 
unanticipated events.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

     The following are the Company's financial and operating highlights for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.  Amounts for 
1996 and 1995 have been restated to reflect Energy's natural gas related 
services business as discontinued operations pursuant to the Restructuring.  
The amounts in the following table are in thousands of dollars, unless 
otherwise noted:



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1997 COMPARED TO 1996

  General

     The Company reported income from continuing operations of $111.8 
million, or $2.16 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1997 compared 
to $22.5 million, or $.51 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1996.  
For the fourth quarter of 1997, income from continuing operations was 
$12.4 million, or $.22 per share, compared to a loss from continuing 
operations of $5.3 million, or $.12 per share, for the fourth quarter of 
1996.  Results from discontinued operations were a loss of $15.7 million, 
or $.39 per share, for the seven months ended July 31, 1997, and income 
of $24.1 million, or $.49 per share, and $50.2 million, or $.89 per share, 
for the quarter and year ended December 31, 1996, respectively.  In 
determining earnings per share, dividends on Energy's preferred stock were 
deducted from income from discontinued operations as such preferred stock 
was issued in connection with Energy's natural gas related services business.

     The May 1, 1997 acquisition of the Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs 
refineries (individually, the "Texas City Refinery," the "Houston Refinery" 
and the "Krotz Springs Refinery"), which were acquired from Salomon Inc in 
connection with the purchase of Basis Petroleum, Inc. ("Basis")(see Note 4 
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), added significantly to the 
Company's 1997 results.  Income from continuing operations and related 
earnings per share increased significantly during 1997 compared to 1996 
due primarily to an increase in operating income, partially offset by an 
increase in income tax expense.  In addition, fourth quarter and total 
year results for 1996 were negatively impacted by a $19.5 million pre-tax 
loss resulting from the write-off of the Company's investment in its joint
venture project to design, construct and operate a plant in Mexico to 
produce methyl tertiary butyl ether ("MTBE").  This loss reduced results 
from continuing operations for such periods by approximately $.29 per share.

Operating Revenues

     Operating revenues increased $3 billion, or 109%, to $5.8 billion 
during 1997 compared to 1996 due to a 116% increase in average daily sales 
volumes resulting primarily from additional throughput volumes attributable 
to the May 1, 1997 acquisition of the Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs 
refineries.  Also contributing, to a lesser extent, to the increase in sales 
volumes was an increase in marketing activities and a 6% increase in 
throughput volumes at the Company's Corpus Christi refinery ("Corpus Christi 
Refinery") resulting from, among other things,  various unit capacity 
expansions completed in late 1996 and 1997 and less unit downtime 
experienced in 1997 compared to 1996.

Operating Income

     Operating income increased $121.3 million, or 135%, to $211 million 
during 1997 compared to 1996 due to an approximate $84 million contribution 
from the operations related to the Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs 
refineries, and to an approximate $67 million increase in total throughput
margins for the operations related to the Corpus Christi Refinery.  Partially
offsetting these increases in operating income were an approximate 
$15 million increase in operating costs at the Corpus Christi Refinery 
(explained below) and an approximate $15 million increase in administrative 
expenses resulting primarily from higher employee-related costs, including 
the effect of additional personnel resulting from the acquisition of Basis 
in May 1997.  Total throughput margins for the operations related to the 
Corpus Christi Refinery increased during 1997 compared to 1996 due to a 
substantial improvement in the price differential between conventional 
gasoline and crude oil, higher oxygenate margins resulting primarily 
from a decrease in methanol feedstock costs as a result of lower production 
costs at the Company's joint venture methanol plant in Clear Lake, Texas 
("Clear Lake Methanol Plant"), and higher premiums on sales of reformulated 
gasoline and petrochemical feedstocks, including a substantial benefit from 
the sale of mixed xylenes produced from the xylene fractionation unit that 
was placed in service at the Corpus Christi Refinery in January 1997.  Total 
throughput margins for the operations related to the Corpus Christi Refinery 
were also higher in 1997 due to less unit downtime compared to 1996 as 
described below.  The increases resulting from these factors were partially 
offset by lower discounts on purchases of resid feedstocks during the last 
nine months of the year due to high demand for resid in the Far East and a
decrease in crude oil prices.  The $15 million, or 7%, increase in operating 
costs at the Corpus Christi Refinery was due primarily to increases in 
maintenance and employee-related costs, incremental costs associated with 
the xylene fractionation unit, and higher variable costs resulting from the 
above noted increase in throughput volumes.  However, due to such increase 
in throughput volumes, operating costs per barrel at the Corpus Christi 
Refinery increased only 2%.

     At the Corpus Christi Refinery, turnarounds of the crude and vacuum 
units were completed in April 1997 which increased the crude unit's capacity 
by approximately 8,000 barrels per day.  Also, in the second quarter of 1997,
the heavy oil cracking unit ("HOC") was shut down for approximately 14 days
as a result  of various unit malfunctions.  In 1996, a maintenance turnaround 
and a catalyst change for the hydrodesulfurization ("HDS") unit were completed
in July, a turnaround of the MTBE Plant was completed in September during 
which its capacity was increased by approximately 1,500 barrels per day, and 
turnarounds of the hydrocracker and naphtha reformer units were completed in 
December.  Also, in the 1996 second quarter, two power outages resulted in 
reduced run rates for several units.  In addition, the Clear Lake Methanol 
Plant was out of service for approximately three months beginning in 
December 1996 as a result of an explosion that occurred as the plant was 
being shut down for repairs.  At the Texas City Refinery, a turnaround and 
catalyst change for the residfiner unit was completed in July 1997.  At the 
Houston Refinery, the fluid catalytic cracking unit ("FCC Unit") was shut 
down for repairs for approximately 11 days in the 1997 second quarter and
approximately 14 days in December 1997, during which times minor turnarounds
were completed.  See "Outlook" for a discussion of maintenance turnarounds 
scheduled at the Company's refineries in 1998.

     The Company enters into various exchange-traded and over-the-counter 
financial instrument contracts with third parties to manage price risk 
associated with refining feedstock and fuel purchases, refined product 
inventories and refining operating margins.  Although such activities are 
intended to limit the Company's exposure to loss during periods of declining 
margins, such activities could tend to reduce the Company's participation in 
rising margins.  In 1997 and 1996, the effect of hedging activities on
refining throughput margins was not significant.  In 1996, the Company 
reduced its operating costs by approximately $2.8 million as a result of 
hedges on refining natural gas fuel requirements.  The effect of such 
hedging activities on operating costs in 1997 was not significant. See 
Note 2 under "Price Risk Management Activities" and Note 7 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Net Interest and Debt Expense

     Net interest and debt expense increased $3.9 million, or 10%, to 
$42.4 million during 1997 compared to 1996 due primarily to interest on 
bank borrowings related to the acquisition of Basis and to the special
pre-Distribution dividend paid to Energy described in Note 1 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The increase in net interest and debt 
expense resulting from these factors was partially offset by a $12.5 million 
decrease in interest expense on allocated corporate debt (see Notes 3 and 6 
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and by a reduction in bank 
borrowings resulting from cash provided by operations subsequent to the 
Restructuring.

Income Tax  Expense

     Income tax expense increased $47.2 million to $63.8 million during 1997 
compared to 1996 due primarily to higher pre-tax income from continuing 
operations.

Discontinued Operations

     The loss from discontinued operations in 1997 of $15.7 million (net of 
an income tax benefit of $8.9 million), or $.39 per share, reflected the net 
loss of Energy's natural gas related services business for the seven months 
ended July 31, 1997, prior to consummation of the Restructuring.  Income from 
discontinued operations in 1996 of $50.2 million (net of income tax expense 
of $24.4 million), or $.89 per share, reflected the net income of Energy's 
natural gas related services business for all of such year.  See Note 3 of 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

1996 COMPARED TO 1995

  General

     The Company reported income from continuing operations of $22.5 million, 
or $.51 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1996 compared to 
$58.2 million, or $1.33 per share, for the year ended December 31, 1995.  
For the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company reported a loss from continuing 
operations of $5.3 million, or $.12 per share, compared to income from 
continuing operations of $11.1 million, or $.25 per share, for the fourth 
quarter of 1995.  Results from discontinued operations were income of 
$24.1 million, or $.49 per share, and $50.2 million, or $.89 per share,
for the quarter and year ended December 31, 1996, respectively, and income 
(loss) of $1.8 million, or $(.02) per share, and $1.6 million, or $(.23) 
per share, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 1995.   In determining 
earnings per share for the 1996 and 1995 periods, dividends on Energy's 
preferred stock were deducted from income from discontinued operations as 
such preferred stock was issued in connection with Energy's natural gas 
related services business.

     Income from continuing operations and related earnings per share 
decreased during the 1996 fourth quarter and total year compared to the 
same periods in 1995 due primarily to a decrease in refining and marketing 
operating income, and a $19.5 million pre-tax loss recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1996 resulting from the write-off of the Company's investment in 
its Mexico MTBE project which reduced results from continuing operations by 
approximately $.29 per share.

  Operating Revenues

     Operating revenues increased $807.1 million, or 41%, to $2.8 billion 
during 1996 compared to 1995 due primarily to a 26% increase in sales 
volumes and a 12% increase in the average sales price per barrel.  The 
increase in sales volumes was due primarily to increased volumes from trading 
and rack marketing activities, and a 6% increase in average daily throughput 
volumes at the Corpus Christi Refinery resulting from various unit 
improvements and enhancements made during 1995 and a reduced impact on 
production due to unit turnarounds which occurred in 1996 compared to 1995, 
partially offset by the effects of two second quarter 1996 power outages.  
The average sales price per barrel increased due primarily to higher 
gasoline and distillate prices which generally followed an increase 
in crude oil prices during 1996.

  Operating Income

     Operating income decreased $34 million, or 27%, to $89.7 million during 
1996 compared to 1995 due primarily to a decrease in total throughput margins
and higher operating costs.  The decrease in total throughput margins was due
primarily to lower oxygenate margins resulting from higher butane feedstock 
costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, lower margins on sales of 
petrochemical feedstocks, and decreased results from price risk management 
activities.  These decreases in throughput margins were partially offset by 
the increase in throughput volumes noted above in the discussion of operating
revenues, higher distillate margins, and an improvement in discounts on 
purchases of resid feedstocks.  Operating expenses increased due primarily 
to costs associated with the Clear Lake Methanol Plant which was placed in 
service in late August 1995 and higher variable costs resulting from 
increased throughput at the Corpus Christi Refinery.

     In 1996, refining throughput margins were reduced by $1.2 million as 
a result of hedging activities compared to a $12.8 million benefit in 1995.  
The 1995 benefit resulted primarily from favorable price swap contracts on 
methanol, as methanol prices dropped by over 70% during that year.  In 1996
and 1995, the Company reduced its operating costs by $2.8 million and 
$1 million, respectively, as a result of hedges on refining natural gas 
fuel requirements.

Net Interest and Debt Expense

     Net interest and debt expense decreased $2.4 million to $38.5 million 
during 1996 compared to 1995 due primarily to a decrease in bank borrowings.

Income Tax  Expense

     Income tax expense decreased $13.8 million in 1996 compared to 1995 due 
primarily to lower pre-tax income.

Discontinued Operations

     Income from discontinued operations in 1996 of $50.2 million (net of 
income tax expense of $24.4 million), or $.89 per share, and in 1995 of 
$1.6 million (net of income tax expense of $4.8 million), or a loss of 
$.23 per share, reflected the net income of Energy's natural gas related 
services business for all of such years.  See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information.

OUTLOOK

     Over the next few years, the Company anticipates a moderate improvement 
in refining margins due to tightening refining capacity.  Increased demand 
for light products is expected to outpace capacity additions due to slow 
growth in capacity additions resulting from poor margins experienced in 
recent years.  Excess conversion capacity triggered by enhanced conversion 
capacity projects in the early to mid-1990's has now been fully absorbed, 
and any such projects currently planned will not keep pace with an expected 
increase in the supply of heavy crudes resulting from increased Middle East 
and Latin American production.  As a result, the spread between light and 
heavy crudes is expected to increase.  The quantity and quality of resid 
feedstock is expected to decrease as conversion capacity expansions come 
on-line in the Middle East and Asia.

     Domestic gasoline demand, which increased 2.5% in 1997 versus only 1% 
in 1996, is expected to continue to improve due to a strong economy and the 
trend in recent years toward less fuel-efficient vehicles.  Demand for 
clean-burning fuels, such as RFG, is expected to continue to increase 
resulting from the worldwide movement to reduce lead in gasoline.  The 
demand for RFG increased to 32.5% of the total demand for gasoline in the 
U.S. in 1997, up from 30.3% in 1996, primarily due to the full-year 
effect of the implementation in 1996 of the requirement for the use of 
Phase II RFG in California and the opt-in to RFG by Phoenix in the summer 
of 1997.  The increasing demand for clean-burning fuels should sustain a 
strong demand for oxygenates such as MTBE.

     Certain initiatives have been presented in California which would 
restrict or potentially ban the use of MTBE as a gasoline component.  
Based on available information, the Company believes that numerous 
scientific studies commissioned by the EPA, CARB, and others will result 
in defeat of these initiatives.  However, if MTBE were to be restricted 
or banned, the Company believes that its MTBE-producing facility could be 
modified to produce a product similar to alkylate or other petrochemicals.

     The Company expects a continuation of the recent industry consolidations 
through mergers and acquisitions, making for a more competitive business 
environment while providing the Company with opportunities to expand its 
operations.  Beginning in 1998, the Company expects to undertake a capital 
expansion program to increase the throughput capacity of its refinery 
facilities by approximately 140,000 barrels per day, and increase the 
operational flexibility of the refineries.  The majority of such program
is anticipated to be performed in 1999 during scheduled maintenance
turnarounds.  

     The Company's turnaround schedule for 1998 is light.  During 
January 1998, catalyst change-outs in the HDS unit and the 
hydrocracker/reformer complex, as well as a maintenance turnaround of 
the MTBE Plant, were completed at the Corpus Christi Refinery.  A 
catalyst change in the residfiner at the Texas City Refinery is currently 
scheduled to begin in late March 1998.  During 1999, maintenance turnarounds
for most of the Company's major refining units are planned.  Such turnarounds
are scheduled to occur early in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter 
when refining margins are historically low so as to minimize the impact on 
the Company's operating results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Net cash provided by continuing operations increased $76.2 million to 
$196.6 million during 1997 compared to 1996 due to the increase in income 
from continuing operations discussed above under "Results of Operations," 
partially offset by the changes in current assets and current liabilities 
detailed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under 
"Statements of Cash Flows."  Included in the changes in current assets 
and current liabilities for 1997 was a substantial decrease in accounts 
payable offset to a large extent by decreases in accounts receivable 
and inventories.  Accounts payable and accounts receivable decreased in 
1997 due to lower commodity prices.  In 1996, inventories increased due 
to increased wholesale marketing activities for the operations related 
to the Corpus Christi Refinery.  The inventory increase in 1996 was almost 
entirely offset by the net change in accounts receivable and accounts 
payable, both of which increased due to higher commodity prices and 
increased purchase and sales volumes.  During 1997, cash provided by 
operating activities, along with net proceeds from bank and other 
borrowings (see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), 
and issuances of common stock related to Energy's benefit plans totaled 
approximately $748 million.  These funds were utilized to acquire Basis,
fund capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, pay 
common and preferred stock dividends, pay a special dividend to Energy 
and settle the intercompany note balance with Energy pursuant to the 
Distribution Agreement (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements), purchase treasury stock, and redeem the remaining outstanding 
shares of Energy's Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 8 of Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements).

     The Company currently maintains a five-year, unsecured $835 million 
revolving bank credit and letter of credit facility that matures in 
November 2002 and is available for general corporate purposes including 
working capital needs and letters of credit.  Borrowings under this 
facility bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin, a base rate or a 
money market rate.  The Company is also charged various fees and expenses, 
including a facility fee and various letter of credit fees.  The interest 
rate and fees under the credit facility are subject to adjustment based 
upon the credit ratings assigned to the Company's long-term debt.  The 
credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants including a coverage 
ratio, a capitalization ratio, and a minimum net worth test, none of which 
are expected to limit the Company's ability to operate in the ordinary 
course of business.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company had approximately 
$558 million available under this committed bank credit facility for 
additional borrowings and letters of credit.  The Company also has numerous 
uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities, along with several uncommitted 
letter of credit facilities.  As of December 31, 1997, a minimum of 
$120 million and a maximum of $313 million were available for additional 
borrowings under the short-term bank credit facilities, and approximately 
$232 million was available for additional letters of credit under the 
uncommitted letter of credit facilities.  As of December 31, 1997, the 
Company's debt to capitalization ratio was 32.3%.  The Company was in 
compliance with all covenants contained in its bank credit and letter of 
credit facilities, and other debt facilities noted below, as of 
December 31, 1997.  See Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  

     During 1997, the Company undertook various initiatives to lower its 
future interest payments and increase its financial flexibility.  In 
April 1997, the Company refinanced $98.5 million principal amount of 
10 1/4% to 10 5/8% tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds, which had due 
dates ranging from 2008 to 2017, with $98.5 million of variable rate 
tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds which have due dates ranging from 
2009 to 2027.  These bonds bore interest at rates ranging from 3.65% 
to 3.95% as of December 31, 1997.  In May 1997, the Company issued 
$25 million of new variable rate tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds 
due in 2031 and used the proceeds to reduce bank borrowings.  These bonds
bore interest at 3.8% as of December 31, 1997.  In addition, in December 
1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of notes ("Notes") 
at an effective interest rate of 5.86% over the initial five years of their 
term, also using the proceeds to reduce bank borrowings.  If the 30-year 
Treasury rate has decreased below 6.13% at the end of five years from the 
date of issuance of the Notes, a third party will likely exercise its 
option to purchase the Notes and the term of the Notes will be 
extended thirty years at 6.13% plus the Company's prevailing credit spread.
If at the end of five years from the date of issuance of the Notes, the 
30-year Treasury rate is higher than 6.13% and as a result the third party 
does not exercise its purchase option, then the Company will be required 
to repurchase the Notes at par.  See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

     In order to reduce the Company's exposure to increases in interest 
rates, in January 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 
commencement of efforts to convert the interest rates on the Company's 
$123.5 million of outstanding industrial revenue bonds from variable 
rates to fixed rates.  At the same time, the Board approved the issuance 
of an additional $25 million of tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds at 
a fixed interest rate and the issuance of up to $43.5 million of taxable 
industrial revenue bonds at variable interest rates, both of which are 
expected to mature in the year 2032.  The $43.5 million of variable 
rate bonds will be supported by a letter of credit issued under the 
Company's $835 million revolving bank credit facility.  The letters of 
credit issued under such facility and associated with the above noted 
$123.5 million of outstanding tax-exempt bonds will be released upon 
conversion of the interest rates from variable to fixed.  The interest 
rate conversion of the outstanding bonds and the issuance of the new 
bonds are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 1998.

     As described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Energy acquired the outstanding common stock of Basis on May 1, 1997 for 
approximately $356 million in cash, funded with borrowings under Energy's 
bank credit facilities, and Energy common stock which had a fair market 
value of $114 million on the date of issuance.  Although Basis incurred 
significant operating losses during 1995 and 1996, the Texas City, Houston 
and Krotz Springs refineries and related marketing operations were able to 
contribute approximately $84 million to the Company's operating income for 
the months of May through December 1997, as described above under "Results 
of Operations."  The achievement of such results was due to, among other 
things, refinery upgrading projects completed both prior to and after the 
acquisition, favorable market conditions which existed throughout much 
of the year, a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to 
the acquisition cost of Basis being less than its net book value, and a 
reduction in operating and overhead costs through various operational and 
personnel-related changes implemented by the Company.  The Company believes
that the operations related to the Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs 
refineries will continue to benefit the Company's consolidated cash flow 
and earnings.

     During 1997, the Company expended, exclusive of the Basis acquisition 
cost, approximately $133 million for capital investments, including capital 
expenditures of $122 million and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs of 
$11 million.  Of the total capital investment amount, $80 million related 
to continuing refining and marketing operations while $53 million related to 
the discontinued natural gas related services operations.  Included in the 
refining and marketing amount was approximately $21 million related to the 
Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs refineries for expenditures during 
the months of May through December.  For 1998, the Company currently expects 
to incur approximately $175 to $225 million for capital investments, 
including approximately $40 to $50 million for deferred turnaround and 
catalyst costs.

     Dividends on the Company's Common Stock are considered quarterly by 
the Company's Board of Directors, and may be paid only when approved by the 
Board.  Prior to the Restructuring, Energy declared dividends on its common 
stock of $.13 per share during each of the first two quarters of 1997.  
Following the Restructuring, the Company declared dividends of $.08 per 
common share during each of the last two quarters of 1997 and the first 
quarter of 1998.  Because appropriate levels of dividends are determined 
by the Board on the basis of earnings and cash flows, the Company cannot 
assure the continuation of Common Stock dividends at any particular level.

     The Company believes it has sufficient funds from operations, and to 
the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank 
markets, to fund its ongoing operating requirements.  The Company expects 
that, to the extent necessary, it can raise additional funds from time to 
time through equity or debt financings; however, except for the new 
issuances of industrial revenue bonds described above and borrowings 
under bank credit agreements, the Company has no specific financing 
plans as of the date hereof to increase the amount of debt outstanding.

     The Company's refining and marketing operations have a concentration 
of customers in the oil refining industry and spot and retail gasoline 
markets.  These concentrations of customers may impact the Company's 
overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in 
that the customers in such industry and markets may be similarly affected 
by changes in economic or other conditions.  However, the Company believes 
that its portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to 
the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk.  Historically, the 
Company has not had any significant problems collecting its accounts 
receivable.  The Company's accounts receivable are not collateralized.

     The Company's refining and marketing operations are subject to 
environmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Capital 
expenditures for environmental control and protection for its refining and 
marketing operations totaled approximately $15 million in 1997 and are 
expected to be approximately $21 million in 1998.  These amounts are 
exclusive of any amounts related to constructed facilities for which the 
portion of expenditures relating to environmental requirements is not 
determinable.  The Corpus Christi Refinery was completed in 1984 under 
more stringent environmental requirements than many existing United States 
refineries, which are older and were built before such environmental 
regulations were enacted.  As a result, the Company believes that it will 
be able to more easily comply with present and future environmental 
legislation with respect to such facility.  Within the next several years, 
all U.S. refineries must obtain federal operating permits under provisions 
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Clean Air Act").  As new rules 
are promulgated under the Clean Air Act, the recently acquired Texas City, 
Houston and Krotz Springs refineries will require additional capital 
investments to upgrade some of their pollution control technology.  The 
Refinery MACT II (Maximum Available Control Technology) standards are 
anticipated to be published in proposed form during the second quarter 
of 1998.  These rules will require refiners to control toxic emissions 
from fluid catalytic crackers, sulfur recovery units, and reformers.  
Once the proposed rules are published, the Company will be able to determine 
what, if any, capital improvements will be required at the Texas City, 
Houston and Krotz Springs refineries.  The final MACT II rules are 
anticipated to be published in late 1998 with a three year compliance 
schedule to install pollution control technology.  The estimated amount of 
1998 environmental expenditures noted above includes amounts for pollution 
control equipment installation at the Texas City, Houston and Krotz Springs 
refineries.  Sulfur plant modifications are not anticipated for the Corpus 
Christi or Texas City refineries; however, depending on the outcome of the 
MACT II rules, sulfur plant control may be necessary for the Houston and 
Krotz Springs refineries.  The Clean Air Act is not expected to have any 
significant adverse impact on the Company's operations and the Company 
does not anticipate that it will be necessary to expend any material 
amounts in 1998 in addition to those mentioned above for environmental 
control and protection.  The Company is not aware of any material 
environmental remediation costs related to its operations.  See Notes 4 
and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information 
regarding the settlement of certain of Salomon's contingent environmental
obligations for which it was liable in connection with the Company's 
acquisition of Basis.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive 
Income."  SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of 
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose 
financial statements and requires that all items that are required to be 
recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive 
income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the 
same prominence as other financial statements.  This statement requires 
that an enterprise classify items of other comprehensive income by their 
nature in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of 
other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and 
additional paid-in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial 
position.  Reclassification of  prior period financial statements presented 
for comparative purposes is required.  This statement becomes effective for 
the Company's financial statements beginning in 1998 and requires that a 
total for comprehensive income be reported in interim period financial 
statements issued to shareholders.  Based on current accounting standards, 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.

     Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."  SFAS No. 131 
establishes new standards for reporting information about operating 
segments in annual financial statements and requires selected operating 
segment information to be reported in interim financial reports issued to 
shareholders.  It also establishes standards for related disclosures about 
products and services, geographic areas and major customers.  This statement 
becomes effective for the Company's financial statements beginning with the 
year ended December 31, 1998 at which time restatement of prior period 
segment information presented for comparative purposes is required.  Interim 
period information is not required until the second year of application, at 
which time comparative information is required.  The adoption of this 
statement is not expected to impact the Company's consolidated financial 
statement disclosures.

     In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures 
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits."  SFAS No. 132 standardizes
the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
to the extent practicable, requires additional information on changes in the
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets, and eliminates certain 
disclosures that are no longer useful.  This statement becomes effective for 
the Company's financial statement disclosures beginning in 1998 and requires 
restatement of prior period disclosures presented for comparative purposes 
unless the information is not readily available. 

     The FASB had previously issued in February 1997 SFAS No. 128, "Earnings 
per Share," (discussed above) and SFAS No. 129, "Disclosure of Information 
about Capital Structure," both of which became effective for the Company's 
financial statements beginning with the period ending December 31, 1997.  
As the purpose of SFAS No. 129 was primarily to consolidate certain 
disclosure requirements previously contained in other pronouncements with 
which the Company was already in compliance, the adoption of this statement 
had no effect on the Company's accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER ISSUES

     Historically, certain computer programs have been written using two 
digits rather than four to define the applicable year, which could result 
in the computer recognizing a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than 
the year 2000.  This, in turn, could result in major system failures or 
miscalculations, and is generally referred to as the "Year 2000" problem.

     In late 1996, the Company began the implementation of new client/server 
based systems which will run substantially all of the Company's principal 
data processing and financial reporting software applications.  These new 
systems are Year 2000 compliant and are expected to be completed by the end 
of 1998.  The Company is also currently evaluating the computerized 
production equipment at its refineries to ensure that the transition to the 
Year 2000 will not disrupt the Company's processing capabilities.  In 
addition, the Company intends to communicate with, and evaluate the systems 
of, its customers, suppliers, financial institutions and others with which 
it does business to identify any Year 2000 issues.  Presently, the Company 
does not believe that Year 2000 compliance will result in material investments
by the Company, nor does the Company anticipate that the Year 2000 problem 
will have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial 
performance of the Company.  There can be no assurance, however, that the 
Year 2000 problem will not adversely affect the Company and its business.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
 of Valero Energy Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Valero Energy Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, common stock and other stockholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.  These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 
based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy 
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

                     VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
   
                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   
1.  RESTRUCTURING
   
      In the discussion below and Notes that follow, the "Company" refers to 
Valero Energy Corporation ("Valero") and its consolidated subsidiaries.  
Valero was formerly known as Valero Refining and Marketing Company prior to 
the Restructuring described below.  Upon completion of the Restructuring, 
Valero Refining and Marketing Company was renamed Valero Energy Corporation.
"Energy" refers to Valero Energy Corporation and its consolidated 
subsidiaries, both individually and collectively, for periods prior to the 
Restructuring, and to the natural gas related services business of Energy for
periods subsequent to the Restructuring.
   
     On July 31, 1997, pursuant to an agreement and plan of distribution 
between Energy and Valero (the "Distribution Agreement"), Energy spun off 
Valero to Energy's stockholders by distributing all of Valero's $.01 par 
value common stock ("Common Stock") on a share for share basis to holders 
of record of Energy common stock at the close of business on such date 
(the "Distribution").  Immediately after the Distribution, Energy merged 
its natural gas related services business with a wholly owned subsidiary 
of PG&E Corporation ("PG&E") (the "Merger").  The Distribution and the 
Merger (collectively referred to as the "Restructuring") were approved by 
Energy's stockholders at Energy's annual meeting of stockholders held on 
June 18, 1997 and, in the opinion of Energy's outside counsel, were tax-free
transactions.  Regulatory approval of the Merger was received from the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") on July 16, 1997.  Upon 
completion of the Restructuring, Valero Refining and Marketing Company was
renamed Valero Energy Corporation and is listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange under the symbol "VLO."
   
     Immediately prior to the Distribution, the Company paid to Energy a 
$210 million dividend pursuant to the Distribution Agreement.  In addition, 
the Company paid to Energy approximately $5 million in settlement of the 
intercompany note balance between the Company and Energy arising from certain
transactions during the period from January 1 through July 31, 1997.
     
     In connection with the Merger, PG&E issued approximately 31 million 
shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding $1 par value 
common shares of Energy, and assumed $785.7 million of Energy's debt.  
Each Energy stockholder received .554 of a share of PG&E common stock 
(trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PCG") for each 
Energy share owned.  This fractional share amount was based on the average 
price of PG&E common stock during a prescribed period preceding the closing 
of the transaction and the number of Energy shares issued and outstanding at 
the time of the closing.
   
     Prior to the Restructuring, Energy, Valero, and PG&E entered into a tax 
sharing agreement ("Tax Sharing Agreement"), which sets forth each party's 
rights and obligations with respect to payments and refunds, if any, of 
federal, state, local or other taxes for periods before the Restructuring.  
In general, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Energy and Valero are each 
responsible for its allocable share of the federal, state and other taxes 
incurred by the combined operations of Energy and Valero prior to the 
Distribution.  Furthermore, Valero is responsible for substantially all tax 
liability resulting from the failure of the Distribution or the Merger to 
qualify as a tax-free transaction, except that Energy will be responsible 
for any such tax liability attributable to certain actions taken by Energy 
and/or PG&E.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
   
     Prior to the Restructuring, Valero was a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Energy.  For financial reporting purposes under the federal securities laws, 
Valero is a "successor registrant" to Energy.  As a result, for periods 
prior to the Restructuring,  the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements include the accounts of Energy restated to reflect Energy's 
natural gas related services business as discontinued operations.  For 
periods subsequent to the Restructuring, the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of Valero and its consolidated 
subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions have been 
eliminated in consolidation.  

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
   
Revenue Recognition
   
     Revenues generally are recorded when products have been delivered.
   
Price Risk Management Activities
   
     The Company enters into price swaps, options and futures contracts with 
third parties to hedge refinery feedstock purchases and refined product 
inventories in order to reduce the impact of adverse price changes on these 
inventories before the conversion of the feedstock to finished products and 
ultimate sale.  Hedges of inventories are accounted for under the deferral 
method with gains and losses included in the carrying amounts of inventories
and ultimately recognized in cost of sales as those inventories are sold.
   
     The Company also hedges anticipated transactions.  Price swaps, options 
and futures contracts with third parties are used to hedge feedstock and 
product purchases, product sales and refining operating margins by locking 
in purchase or sales prices or components of the margins, including feedstock
discounts, the conventional crack spread and premium product differentials.  
Hedges of anticipated transactions are also accounted for under the deferral 
method with gains and losses on these transactions recognized in cost of 
sales when the hedged transaction occurs.
   
     The above noted contracts are designated at inception as a hedge when 
there is a direct relationship to the price risk associated with the 
Company's inventories, future purchases and sales of commodities used in
the Company's operations, or components of the Company's refining operating 
margins.  If such direct relationship ceases to exist, the related contract 
is designated "for trading purposes" and accounted for as described below.
   
     Gains and losses on early terminations of financial instrument contracts
designated as hedges are deferred and included in cost of sales in the 
measurement of the hedged transaction. When an anticipated transaction being 
hedged is no longer likely to occur, the related derivative contract is 
accounted for similar to a contract entered into for trading purposes.
   
     The Company also enters into price swaps, options, and futures contracts 
with third parties for trading purposes using its fundamental and technical 
analysis of market conditions to earn additional revenues.  Contracts entered
into for trading purposes are accounted for under the fair value method.  
Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized as gains or 
losses in cost of sales currently and are recorded in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets in "Prepaid expenses and other" and "Accounts payable" at 
fair value at the reporting date.  The Company determines the fair value 
of its exchange-traded contracts based on the settlement prices for open 
contracts, which are established by the exchange on which the instruments 
are traded.  The fair value of the Company's over-the-counter contracts is 
determined based on market-related indexes or by obtaining quotes from 
brokers.
   
     The Company's derivative contracts and their related gains and losses 
are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements 
of Income as discussed above, depending on whether they are designated as a 
hedge or for trading purposes.  In the Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows, cash transactions related to derivative contracts are included in 
changes in current assets and current liabilities.
   
Inventories
 
     Refinery feedstocks and refined products and blendstocks are carried 
at the lower of cost or market, with the cost of feedstocks purchased for 
processing and produced products determined primarily under the last-in, 
first-out ("LIFO") method of inventory pricing and the cost of feedstocks 
and products purchased for resale determined primarily under the weighted 
average cost method.  The replacement cost of the Company's LIFO inventories 
approximated their LIFO values at December 31, 1997.  Materials and supplies
are carried principally at weighted average cost not in excess of market.  
Inventories as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as follows (in thousands):



     Refinery feedstock and refined product and blendstock inventory volumes 
totaled 15.7 million barrels ("MMbbls") and 7.4 MMbbls as of December 31, 
1997 and 1996, respectively.  See Note 7 for information concerning the 
Company's hedging activities related to its refinery feedstock purchases 
and refined product inventories.
   
Property, Plant and Equipment
   
     Property additions and betterments include capitalized interest and 
acquisition costs allocable to construction and property purchases.
   
     The costs of minor property units (or components of property units), 
net of salvage, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated 
depreciation under the composite method of depreciation.  Gains or losses
on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are credited or 
charged to income.
   
   

     Provision for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is made 
primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
depreciable facilities.  During 1996, a detailed study of the Company's 
fixed asset lives was completed by a third-party consultant for the 
majority of the Company's then-existing processing facilities.  As a 
result of such study, the Company adjusted the weighted-average 
remaining lives of the assets subject to the study, utilizing the 
composite method of depreciation, to better reflect the estimated periods 
during which such assets are expected to remain in service.  The effect of 
this change in accounting estimate was an increase in income from continuing
operations for 1996 of approximately $3.6 million, or $.08 per share.  A 
summary of the principal rates used in computing the annual provision for 
depreciation, primarily utilizing the composite method and including 
estimated salvage values, is as follows:



Deferred Charges and Other Assets
   
Catalyst and Refinery Turnaround Costs
   
     Catalyst costs are deferred when incurred and amortized over the 
estimated useful life of that catalyst, normally one to three years.  
Refinery turnaround costs are deferred when incurred and amortized over 
that period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs.
   
Technological Royalties and Licenses
   
     Technological royalties and licenses are deferred when incurred and 
amortized over the estimated useful life of each particular royalty or 
license.
   
Other Deferred Charges and Other Assets
   
     Other deferred charges and other assets include the Company's 20% 
interest in Javelina Company ("Javelina"), a general partnership that 
owns a refinery off-gas processing plant in Corpus Christi.  The Company 
accounts for its interest in Javelina on the equity method of accounting.  
Also included in other deferred charges and other assets are prefunded 
benefit costs and certain other costs.
   
Accrued Expenses


   
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
   
     The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments approximate 
fair value, except for certain long-term debt as of December 31, 1996 and 
financial instruments used in price risk management activities.  See Notes 6 
and 7.
   
Stock-Based Compensation
   
     The Company accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using 
the "intrinsic value" method of accounting set forth in Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," 
and related interpretations.  Accordingly, compensation cost for stock 
options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of 
the Company's common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an 
employee must pay to acquire the stock.  Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," 
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") in October 
1995, encourages, but does not require companies to measure and recognize 
in their financial statements a compensation cost for stock-based employee 
compensation plans based on the "fair value" method of accounting set forth 
in the statement.  See Note 13 for the pro forma effects on net income and 
earnings per share had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based 
compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123.
   
Earnings Per Share
   
     In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," 
which became effective for the Company's financial statements beginning 
with the period ending December 31, 1997.  This statement supersedes APB 
Opinion No. 15, "Earnings per Share," and related interpretations and 
establishes new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share, 
requiring a dual presentation for companies with complex capital structures.
In accordance with this new statement, the Company has presented basic 
and diluted earnings per share on the face of the accompanying income 
statements.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflects 
the potential dilution of the Company's Convertible Preferred Stock 
(see Note 9) and outstanding stock options and performance awards granted 
to employees in connection with the Company's stock compensation plans 
(see Note 13).  In determining basic earnings per share for the years 
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, dividends on Energy's preferred 
stock were deducted from income from discontinued operations as such 
preferred stock was issued in connection with Energy's natural gas related 
services business.  The weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was 
51,662,449, 43,926,026 and 43,651,914, respectively.

   
     A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and 
diluted per-share computations for income from continuing operations is as 
follows (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts):
  

   
Statements of Cash Flows
   
     In order to determine net cash provided by continuing operations, income 
from continuing operations has been adjusted by, among other things, changes 
in current assets and current liabilities, excluding changes in cash and 
temporary cash investments, current deferred income tax assets, short-term 
debt and current maturities of long-term debt.  The changes in the Company's 
current assets and current liabilities, excluding the items noted above, are 
shown in the following table as an (increase)/decrease in current assets and 
an increase/(decrease) in current liabilities.  The Company's temporary cash 
investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments which have a 
maturity of three months or less when acquired.  (Dollars in thousands.)



   
     Cash interest and income taxes paid, including amounts related to 
discontinued operations for periods up to and including July 31, 1997, 
were as follows (in thousands):



   
     Noncash investing and financing activities for 1997 included the 
issuance of Energy common stock to Salomon Inc ("Salomon") as partial 
consideration for the acquisition of the stock of Basis Petroleum, Inc. 
("Basis"), and an $18.3 million accrual as of December 31, 1997 related 
to the Company's estimate of a contingent earn-out payment in 1998 in 
conjunction with such acquisition.  See Note 4.  In addition, noncash 
investing and financing activities for 1997 included various adjustments 
to debt and equity, including the assumption of certain debt by PG&E that 
was previously allocated to the Company, resulting from the Merger discussed 
in Note 1.
   
New Accounting Standards
   
     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive 
Income."  SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of 
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose 
financial statements and requires that all items that are required to be 
recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income 
be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same 
prominence as other financial statements.  This statement requires that 
an enterprise classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature 
in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other 
comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional 
paid-in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position.
Reclassification of  prior period financial statements presented for 
comparative purposes is required.  This statement becomes effective for 
the Company's financial statements beginning in 1998 and requires that 
a total for comprehensive income be reported in interim period financial 
statements issued to shareholders.  Based on current accounting standards, 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.
   
     Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."  SFAS No. 131 
establishes new standards for reporting information about operating 
segments in annual financial statements and requires selected operating 
segment information to be reported in interim financial reports issued to 
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about 
products and services, geographic areas and major customers.  This statement 
becomes effective for the Company's financial statements beginning with the 
year ended December 31, 1998 at which time restatement of prior period 
segment information presented for comparative purposes is required.  
Interim period information is not required until the second year of 
application, at which time comparative information is required.  The 
adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the Company's 
consolidated financial statement disclosures.
   
     In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits."  SFAS No. 132 standardizes
the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
to the extent practicable, requires additional information on changes in 
the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets, and eliminates 
certain disclosures that are no longer useful.  This statement becomes 
effective for the Company's financial statement disclosures beginning in 
1998 and requires restatement of prior period disclosures presented for 
comparative purposes unless the information is not readily available.
   
     The FASB had previously issued in February 1997 SFAS No. 128, "Earnings 
per Share," (discussed above) and SFAS No. 129, "Disclosure of Information 
about Capital Structure," both of which became effective for the Company's 
financial statements beginning with the period ending December 31, 1997.  
As the purpose of SFAS No. 129 was primarily to consolidate certain disclosure 
requirements previously contained in other pronouncements with which the 
Company was already in compliance, the adoption of this statement had no 
effect on the Company's accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
   
3.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
   
     Energy's historical practice was to utilize a centralized cash management 
system and to incur certain indebtedness for its consolidated group at the 
parent company level rather than at the operating subsidiary level.  
Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect, for 
periods prior to the Restructuring, the allocation of a portion of the 
borrowings under Energy's various bank credit facilities, as well as a 
portion of other corporate debt of Energy, to the discontinued natural gas 
related services business based upon the ratio of such business' net assets, 
excluding the amounts of intercompany notes receivable or payable, to 
Energy's consolidated net assets.  Interest expense related to corporate 
debt was also allocated to the discontinued natural gas related services 
business for periods prior to the Restructuring based on the same net asset 
ratio.  Total interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in the 
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, including a portion of 
interest on corporate debt allocated pursuant to the methodology described 
above plus interest specifically attributed to discontinued operations, 
was $32.7 million for the seven months ended July 31, 1997, and
$58.1 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 
1995, respectively.
   
     Revenues of the discontinued natural gas related services business were 
$1.7 billion for the seven months ended July 31, 1997, and $2.4 billion and 
$1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  
These amounts are not included in operating revenues as reported in the 
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
   
4.  ACQUISITION OF BASIS PETROLEUM, INC.
   
     Effective May 1, 1997, Energy acquired the outstanding common stock of 
Basis, a wholly owned subsidiary of Salomon.  Prior to the Restructuring, 
Energy transferred the stock of Basis to Valero.  As a result, Basis was a 
part of the Company at the time it was spun off to Energy's stockholders 
pursuant to the Restructuring.  The primary assets acquired in the Basis 
acquisition included petroleum refineries located in Texas at Texas City 
and Houston and in Louisiana at Krotz Springs, and an extensive wholesale 
marketing business.  The acquisition has been accounted for using the 
purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values,
pending the completion of an independent appraisal.  The accompanying 
Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company include the results of 
the operations acquired in connection with the purchase of Basis for 
the months of May through December 1997.
   
     Energy acquired the stock of Basis for approximately $470 million.  
This amount includes certain costs incurred in connection with the 
acquisition and is net of $9.5 million received from Salomon in 
December 1997 representing a final resolution between the parties relating 
to certain contingent environmental obligations for which Salomon was 
liable pursuant to the purchase agreement.  The purchase price was paid, 
in part, with 3,429,796 shares of Energy common stock having a fair market 
value of $114 million, with the remainder paid in cash from borrowings 
under Energy's bank credit facilities (see Note 6).  Pursuant to the 
purchase agreement, Salomon is also entitled to receive payments in 
any of the next 10 years if certain average refining margins during any of 
such years exceed a specified level.  Any payments under this earn-out 
arrangement, which will be determined as of May 1 of each year beginning 
in 1998, are limited to $35 million in any year and $200 million in the 
aggregate and will be accounted for by the Company as an additional cost 
of the acquisition and depreciated over the remaining lives of the assets 
to which the additional cost is allocated.  As of December 31, 1997, the 
Company accrued $18.3 million related to its estimate of the contingent
earn-out payment due in 1998.  

     The following unaudited pro forma financial information of the Company 
assumes that the acquisition of Basis occurred at the beginning of each 
period presented.  Such pro forma information is not necessarily indicative 
of the results of future operations. (Dollars in thousands, except per share 
amounts.)
   

   
5.  SHORT-TERM DEBT 
   
     The Company currently maintains seven separate short-term bank credit 
facilities under which amounts ranging from $160 million to $435 million 
may be borrowed.  As of December 31, 1997, $122 million was outstanding 
under these short-term bank credit facilities at a weighted average 
interest rate of approximately 7.7%.  Four of these credit facilities 
are cancelable on demand, and the others expire at various times in 1998.  
These short-term credit facilities bear interest at each respective bank's 
quoted money market rate, have no commitment or other fees or compensating 
balance requirements and are unsecured and unrestricted as to use.
   
6.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND BANK CREDIT FACILITIES
   
     Long-term debt balances as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as 
follows (in thousands):
   
   

     Effective May 1, 1997, Energy replaced its existing unsecured 
$300 million revolving bank credit and letter of credit facility with a 
new five-year, unsecured $835 million revolving bank credit and letter 
of credit facility.  The new credit facility was used to finance a portion 
of the acquisition cost of Basis (see Note 4) and to fund a $210 million 
dividend paid by the Company to Energy immediately prior to the Distribution
(see Note 1).  The facility also provides continuing credit enhancement for 
the Company's Refunding Bonds and Revenue Bonds as discussed below, and can 
be used to provide financing for other general corporate purposes.  Energy 
was the borrower under the facility until the completion of the Restructuring
on July 31, 1997, at which time all obligations of Energy under the facility 
were assumed by the Company.  In November 1997, the facility was amended to 
further enhance the Company's financial flexibility.  Among other things, 
the amendment extended the maturity to November 2002, eliminated provisions 
restricting availability under the facility, and eliminated several 
restrictive covenants.
   
     Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either LIBOR plus 
a margin, a base rate, or a money market rate.  In addition, various fees 
and expenses are required to be paid in connection with the credit facility, 
including a facility fee, a letter of credit issuance fee and a fee based on 
letters of credit outstanding.  The interest rate and fees under the credit 
facility are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to 
the Company's long-term debt.  The credit facility includes certain 
restrictive covenants including a coverage ratio, a capitalization ratio, 
and a minimum net worth test.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 
approximately $558 million available under this revolving bank credit 
facility for additional borrowings and letters of credit.  The Company 
also has several uncommitted bank letter of credit facilities.  As of 
December 31, 1997, such facilities totaled $305 million of which 
approximately $73 million was outstanding.
   
     In April 1997, the Industrial Development Corporation of the Port of 
Corpus Christi issued and sold, for the benefit of the Company, 
$98.5 million of tax-exempt Revenue Refunding Bonds (the "Refunding Bonds"), 
with credit enhancement provided through a letter of credit issued under the 
revolving bank credit facility described above.  The Refunding Bonds were 
issued in four series with due dates ranging from 2009 to 2027.  The 
Refunding Bonds bear interest at variable rates determined weekly, with 
the Company having the right to convert such rates to a daily, weekly or 
commercial paper rate, or to a fixed rate.  The Refunding Bonds were issued 
to refund the Company's $98.5 million principal amount of tax-exempt bonds 
which were issued in 1987.  In May 1997, the Gulf Coast Industrial 
Development Authority issued and sold, for the benefit of the Company, 
$25 million of new Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (the "Revenue Bonds") 
which mature on December 1, 2031, with credit enhancement provided through 
a letter of credit issued under the Company's revolving bank credit 
facility.  Other terms and conditions of these bonds are similar to those 
of the Refunding Bonds.  In January 1998, the Company's Board of Directors 
approved the commencement of efforts to convert the interest rates on the 
Refunding Bonds and Revenue Bonds from variable rates to fixed rates.  At 
the same time, the Board approved the issuance of an additional $25 million 
of tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds at a fixed interest rate and the 
issuance of up to $43.5 million of taxable industrial revenue bonds at 
variable interest rates, both of which are expected to mature in the 
year 2032.  The $43.5 million of variable rate bonds will be supported 
by a letter of credit issued under the Company's revolving bank credit 
facility.  The above noted letters of credit associated with the 
$123.5 million of outstanding Refunding Bonds and Revenue Bonds will be 
released upon conversion of the interest rates from variable to fixed. 
The interest rate conversion of the outstanding bonds and the issuance 
of the new bonds are expected to be completed by the end of the first 
quarter of 1998.
   
     In December 1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of 
6.75% notes (the "Notes") for net proceeds of approximately $156 million.  
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally with all other 
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.  The Notes were 
issued to the Valero Pass-Through Asset Trust 1997-1 (the "Trust"), which 
funded the acquisition of the Notes through a private placement of 
$150 million principal amount of 6.75% Pass-Through Asset Trust Securities
("PATS").  The PATS represent a fractional undivided beneficial interest in 
the Trust.  In exchange for certain consideration paid to the Trust, a third 
party has an option to purchase the Notes under certain circumstances at par 
on December 15, 2002, at which time the term of the Notes would be extended 
30 years to December 15, 2032.  If the third party does not exercise its 
purchase option, then under the terms of the Notes, the Company would be 
required to repurchase the Notes at par on December 15, 2002.
   
     The Company was in compliance with all  covenants contained in its 
various debt facilities as of December 31, 1997.
   
     Based on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1997, the Company 
has no maturities of long-term debt during the next five years except for 
$150 million due in November 2002 under its revolving bank credit and 
letter of credit facility.  See above for maturities under the terms of 
the Notes.
   
     The carrying amounts of the Company's variable-rate industrial revenue 
bonds and revolving bank credit and letter of credit facility approximate 
fair value at December 31, 1997.  The carrying amount of the Company's 
6.75% Notes also approximates fair value at December 31, 1997 due to their 
issuance on December 12, 1997.  As of December 31, 1996, based on the 
borrowing rates available to the Company for long-term debt with similar 
terms and average maturities, the estimated fair value of the Company's 
long-term debt, including current maturities, was $412.7 million.
   
7.  PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
   
Hedging Activities
   
     The Company uses price swaps, options and futures to hedge refinery 
feedstock purchases and refined product inventories in order to reduce the 
impact of adverse price changes on these inventories before the conversion 
of the feedstock to finished products and ultimate sale.  Swaps, options 
and futures contracts held to hedge refining inventories at the end of 
1997 and 1996 had remaining terms of less than one year.  As of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, 14% and 13%, respectively, of the Company's 
refining inventory position was hedged.  As of December 31, 1997, 
$2.1 million of deferred hedge gains were included as a reduction of 
refining inventories, while as of December 31, 1996, $.8 million of 
deferred hedge losses were included as an increase to refining inventories.  
The following table is a summary of the volumes and range of prices for the 
Company's contracts held or issued to hedge refining inventories as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996.  Volumes shown for swaps represent notional 
volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements and 
do not represent volumes exchanged.


   
     The Company also hedges anticipated transactions.  Price swaps, options 
and futures are used to hedge feedstock and product purchases, product sales
and refining operating margins for periods up to five years by locking in 
purchase or sales prices or components of the margins, including the resid 
discount, the conventional crack spread and premium product differentials.  
There were no significant explicit deferrals of hedging gains or losses 
related to these anticipated transactions as of either year end.  The 
following table is a summary of the volumes and range of prices for the 
Company's contracts held or issued to hedge feedstock and product purchases,
product sales and refining margins as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.  
Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to 
calculate amounts due under the agreements and do not represent volumes 
exchanged.
   

   
     The following table discloses the carrying amount and fair value of the 
Company's contracts held or issued for non-trading purposes as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996 (dollars in thousands):
   
   

Trading Activities
   
     The Company enters into transactions for trading purposes using its 
fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions to earn additional 
revenues.  The types of instruments used include price swaps, 
over-the-counter and exchange-traded options, and futures.  These 
contracts run for periods of up to 12 months.  As a result, contracts 
outstanding as of December 31, 1997 will mature in 1998.  The following 
table is a summary of the volumes and range of prices for the Company's 
contracts held or issued for trading purposes as of December 31, 1997 and 
1996.  Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to 
calculate amounts due under the agreements and do not represent volumes 
exchanged.


   
     The following table discloses the fair values of contracts held or
issued for trading purposes and net gains (losses) from trading activities 
as of or for the periods ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 (dollars in 
thousands):


   
Market and Credit Risk
   
     The Company's price risk management activities involve the receipt or 
payment of fixed price commitments into the future.  These transactions give 
rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in market conditions may 
make an instrument less valuable.  The Company closely monitors and manages 
its exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies 
limiting net open positions.  Concentrations of customers in the refining 
industry may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, in that 
the customers in such industry may be similarly affected by changes in 
economic or other conditions.  The Company believes that its counterparties 
will be able to satisfy their obligations under contracts.
   
8.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
   
     On March 30, 1997, Energy redeemed the remaining 11,500 outstanding 
shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock, $8.50 Series A ("Series A 
Preferred Stock").  The redemption price was $104 per share, plus dividends 
accrued to the redemption date of $.685 per share.
   
9.  CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
   
     In April 1997, Energy called all of its outstanding $3.125 convertible 
preferred stock ("Convertible Preferred Stock") for redemption on 
June 2, 1997.  The total redemption price for the Convertible Preferred 
Stock was $52.1966 per share (representing a per-share redemption price 
of $52.188, plus accrued dividends in the amount of $.0086 per share for 
the one-day period from June 1, 1997 to the June 2, 1997 redemption date).  
The Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into Energy common stock at 
a conversion price of $27.03 per share (equivalent to a conversion rate 
of approximately 1.85 shares of common stock for each share of Convertible 
Preferred Stock).  Prior to the redemption, substantially all of the 
outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into 
shares of Energy common stock.
   
10.  PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
   
     In connection with the Distribution, the Company's Board of Directors 
declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share Purchase Right 
("Right") for each outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock 
distributed to Energy stockholders pursuant to the Distribution.  Except 
as set forth below, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase 
from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of the Company's Junior 
Participating Preferred Stock, Series I, ("Junior Preferred Stock") at 
a price of $100 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment.

     Until the earlier to occur of (i) 10 days following a public announcement 
that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "Acquiring 
Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding 
shares of the Company's Common Stock, (ii) 10 business days (or such later date
as may be determined by action of the Company's Board of Directors) following 
the initiation of a tender offer or exchange offer which would result in the 
beneficial ownership by an Acquiring Person of 15% or more of such outstanding
Common Stock (the earlier of such dates being called the "Rights Separation 
Date"), or (iii) the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights, the 
Rights will be transferred only with the Common Stock.  The Rights are not 
exercisable until the Rights Separation Date.  At any time prior to the 
acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial ownership of 15% or more 
of the outstanding Common Stock, the Company's Board of Directors may 
redeem the Rights at a price of $.01 per Right.  The Rights will expire 
on June 30, 2007, unless such date is extended or unless the Rights are 
earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.
   
     In the event that after the Rights Separation Date, the Company is 
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or if 50% 
or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, each holder 
of a Right will have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at 
the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of 
common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction 
will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.  In
the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons 
becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding Common 
Stock, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the
Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the 
right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of Common Stock having 
a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.  
   
     At any time after the acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial 
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock and prior to the 
acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the outstanding 
Common Stock, the Company's Board of Directors may exchange the Right 
(other than Rights owned by such Acquiring Person which have become void), 
at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or one one-hundredth of 
a share of Junior Preferred Stock, per Right (subject to adjustment).  
   
     Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a 
stockholder of the Company including, without limitation, the right to 
vote or to receive dividends.  
   
     The Rights may have certain anti-takeover effects.  The Rights will 
cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire 
the Company on terms not approved by the Company's Board of Directors, 
except pursuant to an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights 
being acquired.  The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other 
business combination approved by the Company's Board of Directors since 
the Rights may be redeemed by the Company prior to the time that a person 
or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Common 
Stock.
   
11.  INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION
   
     Subsequent to the Restructuring, the Company operates in one industry 
segment encompassing the refining and marketing of premium, environmentally 
clean products such as reformulated gasoline, CARB Phase II gasoline, 
low-sulfur diesel and oxygenates.  The Company also produces a substantial 
slate of middle distillates, jet fuel and petrochemicals.  The Company's 
operations consist primarily of four petroleum refineries located in Texas 
at Corpus Christi, Texas City and Houston, and in Louisiana at Krotz Springs 
which have a combined throughput capacity of approximately 530,000 BPD.  
The Company also has certain marketing operations located in Houston.  The 
Company currently markets its products to wholesale customers in 32 states, 
including California and other states located in the Northeast, 
Midwest, Southeast and Gulf Coast, and selected export markets in 
Latin America.  In 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company had no significant 
amount of export sales and no significant foreign operations.  In 1997, 
no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's 
consolidated operating revenues, while in 1996 and 1995, approximately 11% 
and 17%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were 
derived from a major domestic oil company.
   
12.  INCOME TAXES
   
     Components of income tax expense applicable to continuing operations
were as follows (in thousands):



     The following is a reconciliation of total income tax expense to income 
taxes computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% for 
all years presented) to income before income taxes (in thousands):
   




     The tax effects of significant temporary differences representing 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):



   
     At December 31, 1997, the Company had an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") 
credit carryforward of approximately $14.3 million which is available to 
reduce future federal income tax liabilities.  The AMT credit carryforward 
has no expiration date.  The Company has not recorded any valuation 
allowances against deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 1997.
   
     The Company's taxable years through 1993 are closed to adjustment by 
the Internal Revenue Service.  The Company believes that adequate provisions 
for income taxes have been reflected in its consolidated financial statements.
   
13.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
   
Pension Plans
   
     Prior to the Restructuring, Energy maintained a defined benefit pension 
plan.  Pursuant to an "Employee Benefits Agreement" entered into between the 
Company and Energy in connection with the Restructuring, effective at the 
time of the Distribution, the Company became the sponsor of Energy's pension 
plan and became solely responsible for (i) pension liabilities existing 
immediately prior to the time of the Distribution to, or relating to, 
individuals employed by Energy which became employees of PG&E after the 
Distribution, which liabilities will become payable upon the retirement of 
such individuals, (ii) all liabilities to, or relating to, former employees 
of Energy and the Company, and (iii) all liabilities to, or relating to,
current employees of the Company.  Also pursuant to the Employee Benefits 
Agreement, the Company became the sponsor of Energy's nonqualified 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), which provided additional 
pension benefits to executive officers and certain other employees, and 
assumed all liabilities with respect to current and former employees 
of both Energy and the Company under such plan.   

     The Company's pension plan, which is subject to the provisions of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, is designed to provide 
eligible employees with retirement income.  Participation in the plan 
commences upon attaining age 21 and the completion of one year of continuous 
service.  A participant vests in plan benefits after five years of vesting 
service or upon reaching normal retirement date.  Employees of the Company 
who were formerly employees of Basis commenced participation in the plan 
effective January 1, 1998 under the same service requirements as required 
for other Company employees.  For such employees, prior employment with 
Basis is considered in determining vesting service, but credited 
service for the accrual of benefits did not begin until January 1, 1998.
   
     The pension plan provides a monthly pension payable upon normal 
retirement of an amount equal to a set formula which is based on the 
participant's 60 consecutive highest months of compensation during the 
latest 10 years of credited service under the plan.  Contributions to the 
plan by the Company, when permitted, are actuarially determined in an amount 
sufficient to fund the currently accruing benefits and amortize any prior 
service cost over the expected life of the then current work force.  The 
Company's contributions to the pension plan and SERP in 1997, 1996 and 1995 
were approximately $8.8 million, $14.2 million and $4.3 million, 
respectively, and are currently estimated to be $1.1 million in 1998.
   
     In connection with the Restructuring, Energy approved the establishment 
of a supplement to the pension plan (the "1997 Window Plan") which permitted 
certain employees to retire from employment during 1997.
   
     The following table sets forth for the pension plans of the Company, 
including the SERP, the funded status and amounts recognized in the 
Company's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 1997 and 
1996 (in thousands):



   
      The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the actuarial 
present value of the projected benefit obligation was 7% and 7.25% as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The rate of increase in 
future compensation levels used in determining the projected benefit 
obligation as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 was 4% for nonexempt personnel 
and 4% and 3%, respectively, for exempt personnel.  The expected long-term 
rate of return on plan assets was 9.25% as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.
   
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
   
     The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for 
retired employees, referred to herein as "postretirement benefits other than 
pensions."  Substantially all of the Company's employees may become eligible 
for those benefits if, while still working for the Company, they either reach
normal retirement age or take early retirement.  Health care benefits are 
offered by the Company through a self-insured plan and a health maintenance 
organization while life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance 
company.  The Company funds its postretirement benefits other than pensions 
on a pay-as-you-go basis.   Pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement, 
effective at the time of the Distribution, the Company became responsible 
for all liabilities to former employees of both Energy and the Company as 
well as current employees of the Company arising under Energy's health care 
and life insurance programs.  Employees of the Company who were formerly 
employees of Basis became eligible for postretirement benefits other than 
pensions under the Company's plan effective January 1, 1998.
   
     The following table sets forth for the Company's postretirement benefits 
other than pensions, the funded status and amounts recognized in the Company's
consolidated financial statements at December 31, 1997 and 1996 (in thousands):


   
     Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the years ended 
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 included the following components 
(in thousands):


   
     For measurement purposes, the assumed health care cost trend rate was 5% 
in 1997, remaining level thereafter.  The health care cost trend rate 
assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the obligation and 
periodic cost reported.  An increase in the assumed health care cost trend 
rate by 1% in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1997 by $5.8 million and the aggregate of the 
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit 
cost for the year then ended by $.8 million.  The weighted average discount 
rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 was 7% and 7.25%, respectively.
   
Profit-Sharing/Savings Plans
   
     Prior to the Restructuring, Energy maintained a qualified profit-sharing 
plan (the "Thrift Plan").  Effective at the time of the Distribution, the 
Company became the sponsor of the Thrift Plan and became solely responsible 
for all liabilities arising under the Thrift Plan after the time of the 
Distribution with respect to current Company employees and former employees 
of both Energy and the Company.  Each Energy employee participating in the 
Thrift Plan prior to the Distribution who became a PG&E employee subsequent 
to the Distribution transferred their account balance to the PG&E thrift 
plan.   

     The purpose of the Thrift Plan is to provide a program whereby 
contributions of participating employees and their employers are 
systematically invested to provide the employees an interest in the Company 
and to further their financial independence.  Participation in the Thrift 
Plan is voluntary and is open to employees of the Company who become 
eligible to participate upon attaining age 21 and the completion of one 
year of continuous service.  Employees of the Company who were formerly 
Basis employees became eligible to participate in the Thrift Plan on 
January 1, 1998 under the same service requirements as required for other 
Company employees, with service including prior employment with Basis.  
Basis's previously existing 401(k) profit-sharing and retirement savings 
plan was maintained for such employees through December 31, 1997 and was 
merged into the Company's Thrift Plan effective January 1, 1998.
   
     Participating employees may contribute from 2% up to 22% of their total 
annual compensation, subject to certain limitations, to the Thrift Plan.  
Participants may elect to make such contributions on either a before-tax or 
after-tax basis, with federal income taxes on before-tax contributions being 
deferred until such time as a distribution is made to the participant.  
Participants' contributions to the Thrift Plan of up to 8% of their base 
annual compensation are matched 75% by the Company, with an additional match 
of up to 25% subject to certain conditions.  Participants' contributions in 
excess of 8% of their base annual compensation are not matched by the 
Company.  Up until termination of the VESOP (see below) in 1997, the Company 
made contributions to the Thrift Plan to the extent 75% of participants' base
contributions (from 2% up to 8% of total base salary) exceeded the amount 
of the Company's contribution to the  VESOP for debt service.  Subsequent 
to the VESOP termination, all Company contributions were made to the Thrift 
Plan.  Company contributions to the Thrift Plan were $2,253,000 in 1997.  
There were no Company contributions to the Thrift Plan in 1996 or 1995.
   
     In 1989, Energy established the Valero Employees' Stock Ownership Plan 
("VESOP") which was a leveraged employee stock ownership plan.  Pursuant to 
a private placement in 1989, the VESOP issued notes in the principal amount 
of $15 million.  The net proceeds from this private placement were used 
by the VESOP trustee to fund the purchase of Energy common stock.  During 
1991, Energy made an additional loan of $8 million to the VESOP which was 
also used by the trustee to purchase Energy common stock.  The 1989 and 
1991 VESOP loans are referred to herein as the "VESOP Notes."  In connection
with effecting the Restructuring, on April 11, 1997, Energy's Board of 
Directors approved the termination of the VESOP and subsequently directed 
the VESOP trustee to sell a sufficient amount of Energy common stock held 
in the VESOP suspense account to repay the outstanding amount of VESOP Notes 
and allocate the remaining stock in the suspense account to the accounts of 
the VESOP participants.  The VESOP Notes were repaid in full in May 1997, 
after which 226,198 remaining shares of Energy common stock were allocated
to all VESOP participants.
   
     As noted above, prior to termination of the VESOP, the Company's annual 
contribution to the Thrift Plan was reduced by the Company's contribution to 
the VESOP for debt service.  During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company 
contributed $586,000, $3,372,000 and $3,170,000, respectively, to the VESOP,
comprised of $58,000, $525,000 and $678,000, respectively, of interest on the
VESOP Notes and $541,000, $3,072,000 and $2,918,000, respectively, of 
compensation expense.  Compensation expense was based on the VESOP debt 
principal payments for the portion of the VESOP established in 1989 and on 
the cost of the shares allocated to participants for the portion of the 
VESOP established in 1991.  Dividends on VESOP shares of common stock were 
recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.  Dividends on allocated shares
of common stock were paid to participants.  Dividends paid on unallocated 
shares were used to reduce the Company's contributions to the VESOP during 
1997, 1996 and 1995  by  $13,000, $225,000 and $426,000, respectively.  
VESOP shares of common stock were considered outstanding for earnings per 
share computations.  As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the number of 
allocated shares was 1,052,454 and 940,470, respectively, the number of 
committed-to-be-released shares was 62,918 for both years, and the number 
of suspense shares was 583,301 and 772,055, respectively.
   
Stock Compensation Plans
   
     Prior to the Restructuring, Energy maintained various stock 
compensation plans.  In connection with the Restructuring, all stock 
options held by Energy employees under any of such stock compensation plans 
that were granted prior to January 1, 1997 became 100% vested and immediately
exercisable upon the approval of the Restructuring by Energy's stockholders 
on June 18, 1997.  For all options still outstanding at the time of the 
Distribution, pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement, each option 
to purchase Energy Common Stock held by a current or former employee of 
the Company was converted into an option to acquire shares of Company Common 
Stock, and each option held by a current or former employee of Energy's 
natural gas related services business  was converted into an option to 
acquire shares of PG&E common stock.  In each case, the number of options 
and related exercise prices were converted in such a manner so that the 
aggregate option value for each holder immediately after the Restructuring 
was equal to the aggregate option value immediately prior to the 
Restructuring.  The other terms and conditions of any such converted 
option remained essentially unchanged.  All restricted stock issued 
pursuant to Energy's stock compensation plans became fully vested either 
upon the approval of the Restructuring by Energy's stockholders on 
June 18, 1997 or upon the completion of the Restructuring on July 31, 1997.   

     As of December 31, 1997, the Company had various fixed and 
performance-based stock compensation plans.  The Company's Executive 
Stock Incentive Plan (the "ESIP"), which was maintained by Energy prior 
to the Restructuring,  authorizes the grant of various stock and 
stock-related awards to executive officers and other key employees.  
Awards available under the ESIP include options to purchase shares 
of Common Stock, restricted stock which vests over a period determined 
by the Company's compensation committee, and performance shares which 
vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal.  A total of 
2,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be issued under the ESIP, of 
which no more than 1,000,000 shares may be issued as restricted stock.  
Under the ESIP,  6,250 shares of restricted stock were granted during the 
period August 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997 at a weighted average 
grant-date fair value of $31.78 per share and 24,563 performance shares 
were granted during the period January 1, 1997 through July 31, 1997 at 
a weighted average grant-date fair value of $34.58 per share.  The Company 
also has a non-qualified stock option plan (the "Stock Option Plan") which, 
at the date of the Restructuring, replaced three non-qualified stock option 
plans previously maintained by Energy.  Awards under the Stock Option Plan 
are granted to key officers, employees and prospective employees of the 
Company.  A total of 2,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be 
issued under the Stock Option Plan.  The Company also maintains an 
Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, under which 200,000 shares of Company 
Common Stock may be issued, that provides bonus compensation to key 
employees of the Company based on individual contributions to Company 
profitability.  Bonuses are payable either in cash or in whole or in 
part in Company Common Stock.  No grants of Common Stock were made under 
this plan in 1997.  The Company also has a non-employee director stock 
option plan, under which 200,000  shares of Company Common Stock may be 
issued, and a non-employee director restricted stock plan, under 
which 100,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be issued.  During the 
period August 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997, 9,336 shares were granted 
under the non-employee director restricted stock plan at a weighted average 
grant-date fair value of $28.94 per share.
   
     Under the terms of the ESIP, the Stock Option Plan and the non-employee 
director stock option plan, the exercise price of the options granted will 
not be less than the fair market value of Common Stock at the date of grant.
Stock options become exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements 
between the Company and the participants, generally in three equal annual 
installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with unexercised 
options expiring ten years from the date of grant.  A summary of the status 
of the Company's stock option plans, including options granted under the 
ESIP, the Stock Option Plan, the non-employee director stock option plan 
and Energy's previously existing stock compensation plans, as of 
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, and changes during the years then ended 
is presented in the table below.  (Note: Shares outstanding at July 31, 1997 
prior to the Restructuring differs from shares outstanding at August 1, 1997 
after the Restructuring because the August 1 amount: (i) excludes options 
held by current or former employees of Energy's natural gas related services 
business which were converted to PG&E options and (ii) reflects the 
conversion of Energy options held by current or former employees of the 
Company to an equivalent number of Company options.)
   

   

     The following table summarizes information about stock options 
outstanding under the ESIP, the Stock Option Plan and the non-employee 
director stock option plan as of December 31, 1997:


   
     The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of 
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following 
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively:  risk-free interest rates of 6.3 percent, 6.4 percent and 
6.7 percent; expected dividend yields of 1.5 percent, 1.9 percent and 2.8 
percent; expected lives of 3.2 years, 3.1 years and 3.2 years; and expected 
volatility of 26.2 percent, 25.5 percent and 29.5 percent.
   
     For each share of stock that can be purchased thereunder pursuant to a 
stock option, the Stock Option Plan provides, and the predecessor stock 
option plans of Energy provided,  that a SAR may also be granted.  A SAR is
a right to receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the fair 
market value of Common Stock on the exercise date and the option price of 
the stock to which the SAR is related.  SARs are exercisable only upon the 
exercise of the related stock options.  At the end of each reporting 
period within the exercise period, the Company recorded an adjustment to 
compensation expense based on the difference between the fair market value 
of Common Stock at the end of each reporting period and the option price 
of the stock to which the SAR was related.  During the January 1, 1997 
through July 31, 1997 period prior to the Restructuring, 88,087 SARs 
were exercised at a weighted-average exercise price of $14.52 per share, 
and no SARs related to Company Common Stock remained outstanding as of 
July 31, 1997.  During the August 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997 
period subsequent to the Restructuring, no SARs were granted.
   
     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations 
in accounting for its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation cost has been 
recognized for its fixed stock option plans.  The after-tax compensation 
cost reflected in net income for stock-based compensation plans was 
$4.6 million, $2.6 million and $1.7 million for 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively.  Of these amounts, $2.1 million, $1.4 million and 
$.9 million related to the discontinued natural gas related services 
business.  Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based 
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant 
dates for 1997, 1996 and 1995 awards under those plans consistent with 
the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and earnings per 
share for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 would have 
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

   

     Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to 
awards granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation
cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years. 
   
14.  LEASE AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 
   
     The Company has long-term operating lease commitments in connection 
with land, office facilities and equipment, and various facilities and 
equipment used in the storage, transportation and production of refinery 
feedstocks and/or refined products.  Long-term leases for land have 
remaining primary terms of up to 26.7 years, while long-term leases for 
office facilities have remaining primary terms of up to 4.5 years. The 
Company's long-term leases for production equipment, feedstock and refined 
product storage facilities and transportation assets have remaining primary 
terms of up to 14.1 years and in certain cases provide for various 
contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in 
excess of a base amount. 
   
     Future minimum lease payments and minimum rentals to be received under
subleases as of December 31, 1997 for operating leases having initial or 
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows 
(in thousands):
   

   
     Consolidated rental expense under operating leases for continuing 
operations amounted to approximately $39,805,000, $26,739,000, and 
$24,177,000 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Such amounts are 
included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in cost of 
sales and operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses 
and include various month-to-month and other short-term rentals in 
addition to rents paid and accrued under long-term lease commitments.

     The Company has a product supply arrangement which requires the
payment of a reservation fee of approximately $10.4 million annually 
through August 2002.
   
15.  LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES 
   
Litigation Relating to Operations of Basis Prior to Acquisition
   
     Basis was named as a party to numerous claims and legal proceedings 
which arose prior to its acquisition by the Company.  Pursuant to the 
stock purchase agreement between Energy, the Company, Salomon, and Basis, 
Salomon assumed the defense of all known suits, actions, claims and 
investigations pending at the time of the acquisition and all obligations, 
liabilities and expenses related to or arising therefrom.  In addition, 
Salomon agreed to assume all obligations, liabilities and expenses related 
to or resulting from all private third-party suits, actions and claims which 
arise out of a state of facts existing on or prior to the time of the 
acquisition (including "superfund" liability), but which were not pending 
at such time, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations.  In 
certain pending matters, the plaintiffs are requesting injunctive relief 
which, if granted, could potentially result in the operations acquired in 
connection with the purchase of Basis being adversely affected through 
required reductions in emissions, discharges, or refinery throughput, 
which could be outside Salomon's indemnity obligations.  As discussed in 
Note 4, the Company and Salomon reached an agreement in December 1997 
whereby Salomon paid the Company $9.5 million in settlement of certain 
of Salomon's contingent environmental obligations assumed under the stock
purchase agreement.  This settlement did not affect Salomon's other 
indemnity obligations described in this paragraph.
   
Litigation Relating to Discontinued Operations
   
     Energy and certain of its natural gas related subsidiaries, as well as 
the Company, have been sued by Teco Pipeline Company ("Teco") regarding the 
operation of the 340-mile West Texas pipeline in which a subsidiary of Energy
holds a 50% undivided interest.  In 1985, a subsidiary of Energy sold a 50% 
undivided interest in the pipeline and entered into a joint venture through 
an ownership agreement and an operating agreement, each dated 
February 28, 1985, with the purchaser of the interest.  In 1988, Teco 
succeeded to that purchaser's 50% interest.  A subsidiary of Energy has 
at all times been the operator of the pipeline.  Notwithstanding the written 
ownership and operating agreements, the plaintiff alleges that a separate, 
unwritten partnership agreement exists, and that the defendants 
have exercised improper dominion over such alleged partnership's affairs.  
The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants acted in bad faith by 
negatively affecting the economics of the joint venture in order to provide 
financial advantages to facilities or entities owned by the defendants and by 
allegedly usurping for the defendants' own benefit certain opportunities 
available to the joint venture.  The plaintiff asserts causes of action for 
breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, tortious interference with business 
relationships, professional malpractice and other claims, and seeks 
unquantified actual and punitive damages.  Energy's motion to compel 
arbitration was denied, but Energy has filed an appeal.  Energy has also 
filed a counterclaim alleging that the plaintiff breached its own 
obligations to the joint venture and jeopardized the economic and 
operational viability of the pipeline by its actions.  Energy is seeking 
unquantified actual and punitive damages.  Although PG&E previously acquired 
Teco and now ultimately owns both Teco and Energy after the Restructuring, 
PG&E's Teco acquisition agreement purports to assign the benefit or 
detriment of this lawsuit to the former shareholders of Teco.  Pursuant 
to the Distribution Agreement by which the Company was spun off to Energy's 
stockholders in connection with the Restructuring, the Company has agreed to 
indemnify and hold harmless Energy with respect to this lawsuit to the 
extent of 50% of the amount of any final judgment or settlement amount 
not in excess of $30 million, and 100% of that part of any final judgment 
or settlement amount in excess of $30 million.
   
General
   
     The Company is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings 
arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes it is 
unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to 
which the Company is a party would have a material adverse effect on the 
Company's financial statements; however, due to the inherent uncertainty 
of litigation, the range of possible loss, if any, cannot be estimated 
with a reasonable degree of precision and there can be no assurance 
that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have 
an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations for the interim 
period in which such resolution occurred.   

16.  QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)
   
     The results of operations by quarter for the years ended 
December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as follows (in thousands of dollars, 
except per share amounts):

   * Filed herewith
   + Identifies management contracts or compensatory plans or arrangements 
         required to be filed as an exhibit hereto pursuant to Item 14(c) 
         of Form 10-K.
   ** The Financial Data Schedule and Restated Financial Data Schedule shall 
         not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities 
         Act of 1933 or Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
         and are included as exhibits only to the electronic filing of this 
         Form 10-K in accordance with Item 601(c) of Regulation S-K and 
         Section 401 of Regulation S-T.
   
     Copies of exhibits filed as a part of this Form 10-K may be obtained by 
stockholders of record at a charge of $.15 per page, minimum $5.00 each 
request.  Direct inquiries to Jay D. Browning, Corporate Secretary, 
Valero Energy Corporation, P.O. Box 500, San Antonio, Texas 78292.
   
     Pursuant to paragraph 601(b)(4)(iii)(A) of Regulation S-K, the 
registrant has omitted from the foregoing listing of exhibits, and hereby 
agrees to furnish to the Commission upon its request, copies of certain 
instruments, each relating to long-term debt not exceeding 10% of the total 
assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
   
    (b)  Reports on Form 8-K.  The Company did not file any Current Reports 
on Form 8-K during the quarter ended December 31, 1997.

     For the purposes of complying with the rules governing Form S-8 under 
the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes 
as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into 
registrant's Registration Statements on Form S-8 No. 333-31709 
(filed July 21, 1997), No. 333-31721 (filed July 21, 1997), No. 333-31723 
(filed July 21, 1997) and No. 333-31727 (filed July 21, 1997):
   
     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and 
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, 
or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public 
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, 
unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such 
liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred 
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in 
the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by 
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the 
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion 
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether 
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the 
Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be
