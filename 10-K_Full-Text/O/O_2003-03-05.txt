PART I

ITEM 1:  BUSINESS
         --------
                                   THE COMPANY

Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company (R), a Maryland
corporation ("Realty Income," the "Company," "our" or "we") was organized to
operate as an equity real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company's
primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions
from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations ("FFO") per
share. Over the past 33 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been
acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue
under long-term (primarily 15 to 20 year) lease agreements. The monthly
distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail
properties leased to regional and national retail chains.

We are a fully integrated, self-administered real estate company with in-house
acquisition, leasing, legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio
management and capital markets expertise. We seek to increase distributions to
stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio management and the
acquisition of additional properties. Our portfolio management focus includes:

o    Contractual rent increases on existing leases;
o    Rent increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions
     permit; and
o    The active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing of
     vacant properties and selective sales of properties.

Our acquisition of additional properties adheres to a focused strategy of
primarily acquiring properties that are:

o    Freestanding, single-tenant, retail locations;
o    Leased to regional and national retail chains; and
o    Under long-term, net-lease agreements.

At December 31, 2002, we owned a diversified portfolio:

o    Of 1,197 retail properties;
o    With an occupancy rate of 97.7%, or 1,170 properties occupied of the 1,197
     properties in the portfolio;
o    Leased to 79 different retail chains;
o    Doing business in 25 separate retail industries;
o    Located in 48 states;
o    With approximately 10 million square feet of leasable space; and
o    With an average leasable retail space of 8,400 square feet.

Of the 1,197 properties in the portfolio, 1,192, or 99.6%, are single-tenant
retail properties with the remaining five being multi-tenant properties. At
December 31, 2002, 1,165, or 97.7%, of the 1,192 single-tenant properties were
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension
options) of approximately 10.9 years.

In addition to our real estate portfolio, at December 31, 2002, our taxable REIT
subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest Net"), had invested $4.6 million in a
portfolio of four retail properties located in three states. These properties
are held for sale.

We typically acquire retail store locations under long-term leases with retail
chain store operators. This provides capital to the operators for continued
expansion and other corporate purposes. Our acquisition and investment
activities are concentrated in well-defined target markets and generally focus
on middle-market retailers providing goods and services that satisfy basic
consumer needs.





Our net-lease agreements generally:

o    Are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;
o    Require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating
     expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and
o    Provide for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on
     increases in the consumer price index, fixed increases, or additional rent
     calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified
     level.

Realty Income commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the
merger of 25 public and private real estate limited partnerships with and into
the Company. Each of the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the
purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased properties.

The six senior officers of the Company owned 1.0% of the Company's outstanding
common stock with a market value of $11.9 million at March 1, 2003. The
directors and six senior officers of the Company, as a group, owned 2.6% of the
Company's outstanding common stock with a market value of $31.8 million at
March 1, 2003.

Realty Income's common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
under the ticker symbol "O." Our central index key ("CIK") number is 726728 and
cusip number is 756109-104.

Realty Income's Class B cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the
NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprB" and its cusip number is 756109-302.

Realty Income's Class C cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the
NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprC" and its cusip number is 756109-500.

Realty Income's 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes, due 2008 are listed on the
NYSE under the ticker symbol "OUI". The cusip number of these notes is
756109-203.

Realty Income had 56 employees as of March 1, 2003.

We maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make
available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those
reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").


                               RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK. In July 2002, we issued 1,550,000 shares of common
stock at a price of $33.40 per share. The net proceeds of $48.9 million were
used to repay a portion of our $200 million acquisition credit facility.

In February 2002, we issued 273,150 shares of common stock to a unit investment
trust at a net price to us of $30.26 per share, based on a 5% discount to the
market price at the time of issuance of $31.85 per share. The net proceeds of
$8.2 million were used to repay a portion of our $200 million acquisition credit
facility.

NEW $250 MILLION BANK CREDIT FACILITY. In October 2002, we entered into a new
$250 million credit facility to replace our existing $200 million acquisition
credit facility and our $25 million credit facility, each of which was scheduled
to expire in 2003. Under the terms of the new credit facility, total funds
available were increased by $25 million. Concurrent with the closing of the new
facility, our previous credit facilities were canceled.






The borrowing rate on the new credit facility was reduced compared to the
previous credit facilities. Realty Income's current investment grade credit
ratings provide for financing at LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 90
basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of
110 basis points over LIBOR as compared to an all-in pricing of 145 basis points
on our previous credit facilities. The term of the new facility extends through
October 2005.

The co-lead Arranger and sole Administrative Agent for the credit facility is
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with The Bank of New York acting as co-lead Arranger and
sole Documentation Agent. They are joined by the Bank of America, N.A. and
Wachovia Bank, National Association as co-Syndication Agents. Five other banks
are also participants in providing the credit line: AmSouth Bank, Bank of
Montreal, U.S. Bank National Association, BANK ONE, NA and Chevy Chase Bank,
FSB.

UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION OF $500 MILLION. In December 2002, we filed a
universal shelf registration statement with the SEC covering up to $500 million
in value of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. This registration
statement was declared effective by the SEC in January 2003. Through March 1,
2003, we have not issued any securities under the universal shelf registration
statement.

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. In 2002, we acquired 108 properties (the "New
Properties") located in 24 states. In 2002, we invested $133.3 million in the
New Properties and properties under development, excluding estimated unfunded
development costs at December 31, 2002 of $9.3 million and investments by Crest
Net.

The initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the $133.3 million
invested in 2002 is estimated to be 10.4%, computed as estimated contractual net
operating income (which in the case of a net-leased property is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of properties under construction, the estimated base
rent under the lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated
total costs. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above.

The New Properties are expected to contain approximately 719,800 leasable square
feet and are 100% leased under net leases, with an average initial lease term of
19.8 years. As of December 31, 2002, six of the New Properties were leased and
under construction, pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to
develop the properties (with development costs funded by Realty Income) and with
rent scheduled to begin in 2003.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO). In 2002, our FFO increased by $17.3 million, or
22.2%, to $95.1 million versus $77.8 million in 2001. See our discussion of FFO
in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" in this annual report, which includes a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO.

In 2002, Crest Net generated $2.7 million in FFO for Realty Income. The future
contribution, if any, to our FFO by Crest Net will depend on the timing and the
number of property sales it achieves, if any, in a given year.

CREST NET. We created Crest Net in January 2000 to buy, own and sell properties,
primarily to buyers using tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Realty Income owns 100%
of Crest Net's stock. The financial statements of Crest Net are consolidated
into Realty Income's financial statements. All material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In 2002, Crest Net invested $6.1 million in three retail properties and
properties under development. These three new properties are expected to contain
approximately 13,200 leasable square feet, are 100% leased and have initial
lease terms averaging 18.4 years. Two of these properties were sold in 2002.






In 2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties for $27.3 million and Realty Income
recorded a gain of $3.5 million, before income taxes. At the end of 2002, Crest
Net carried an inventory of $4.6 million, which is included on Realty Income's
consolidated balance sheet in real estate held for sale, net.

SALES OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES. In 2002, we sold or exchanged 35 properties for
a total of $20.2 million and recognized a gain of $6.3 million. Of this gain,
$6.0 million is included in income from discontinued operations.

We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate
higher returns, enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or
extend our average remaining lease term. At December 31, 2002, we classified
real estate with a carrying amount of $6.5 million as held for sale, which
includes $4.6 million in properties owned by Crest Net. Additionally, we
anticipate selling properties from our portfolio that have not yet been
specifically identified. We anticipate we will receive between $15 million and
$30 million in proceeds from the sale of properties during the next 12 months.
We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions.

INCREASES IN MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. We continue our
33-year policy of paying distributions monthly. In the past 12 months, we
increased monthly distributions per share by $0.00125 on four separate
occasions. In April 2002 the increase per share was to $0.19125, in July 2002 to
$0.1925, in October 2002 to $0.19375 and in January 2003 to $0.195. The increase
in January 2003 was our 21st consecutive quarterly increase and 23rd increase in
the amount of our dividend since the Company's listing on the NYSE in 1994. In
2002, we paid 12 monthly cash distributions per share; three in the amount of
$0.19, three in the amount of $0.19125, three in the amount of $0.1925, and
three in the amount of $0.19375, totaling $2.3025 per share. In December 2002,
January 2003 and February 2003, we declared distributions of $0.195 per share,
which were paid on January 15, 2003, and February 18, 2003, and will be paid on
March 17, 2003, respectively.

The monthly distribution of $0.195 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of $2.34 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 6.8% based on the last reported sale price of the Company's Common
Stock on the NYSE of $34.66 on March 1, 2003. Although we expect to continue our
policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain the current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share, or what the actual distribution yield
will be for any future period.


                               DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Distributions are paid to our common stockholders and Class C Preferred
stockholders on a monthly basis and are paid to our Class B Preferred
stockholders on a quarterly basis if, as and when declared by our Board of
Directors. The Class B Preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions
at a rate of 9.375% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference
(equivalent to $2.34375 per annum per share). The Class C Preferred stockholders
receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 9.5% per annum on the $25 per
share liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.375 per annum per share).

In order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders
aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without
regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains) and
we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our
REIT taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2002, our distributions
totaled approximately 106.9% of our estimated REIT taxable income. Our estimated
REIT taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and
amortization. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders
that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce
our exposure to income taxes. Our 2002 distributions to common stockholders were
82.1% of our funds from operations.





Our future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and
will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, financial
condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under
the REIT provisions of the Code, our debt service requirements and other factors
as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility
contains financial covenants which could limit the amount of distributions
payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or
financial condition, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the
common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to
any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our
credit facility.

Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal
income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary
income, except to the extent we recognize capital gains and declare a capital
gains dividend. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will
be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders' basis in the stock.
Distributions above that basis generally will be treated as a capital gain.
Approximately 5.8% of the distributions made or deemed to have been made in 2002
to our common stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal
income tax purposes. We are unable to predict the portion of future
distributions that may be classified as a return of capital.


                        BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY. We believe that the long-term ownership of an actively
managed, diversified portfolio of retail properties, under long-term net-lease
agreements, produces consistent, predictable income. Under a net-lease
agreement, the tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses
(taxes, maintenance and insurance) plus, typically, future rent increases
(generally subject to ceilings) based on increases in the consumer price index,
fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants'
gross sales above a specified level. We believe that long-term leases, coupled
with the tenant's responsibility for property expenses, generally produce a more
predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while
continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY. In identifying new properties for acquisition, our focus is
on providing expansion capital to retail chains by acquiring, then leasing back,
their retail store locations. We categorize retail tenants as: 1) venture
market, 2) middle market, and 3) upper market. Venture companies typically offer
a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate between
five and 50 retail outlets. Middle market retail chains typically have 50 to 500
retail outlets, operations in more than one geographic region, have been
successful through one or more economic cycles, and have a proven, replicable
concept. The upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500
or more stores, operating nationally in a proven, mature retail concept. Upper
market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to
several sources of capital.

Realty Income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market
retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because:

o    They generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial
     obstacles that can adversely affect venture retailers;
o    They typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited
     financing options;
o    They generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over
     time since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve
     as their businesses have matured;
o    Their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across
     a greater number of stores; and
o    Middle market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a
     number of locations are closed due to underperformance.





We also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper
market retail chains. We believe upper market retail chains can be attractive
for investment because:

o    They typically are of a higher credit quality;
o    They usually are larger brand name, public and private retailers;
o    They utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square
     feet; and
o    They are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger
     transaction sizes.

While our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased
to middle and upper market retail chains, we also selectively seek investment
opportunities with venture market retail chains. Periodically, venture market
opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is
high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices. To meet our stringent
investment standards, however, venture retail companies must have a well-defined
retailing concept and strong financial prospects. These opportunities are
examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making
investments in this area.

Historically, our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a
service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of
businesses is more stable. Because of this investment focus, at December 31,
2002, approximately 76% of our annualized rent (as the term is used on page 13)
is derived from retailers with a service component in their business.
Furthermore, we believe these service-oriented businesses would be difficult to
duplicate over the Internet and that our properties continue to perform well
relative to competition from Internet businesses.

CREDIT STRATEGY. We generally provide sale-leaseback financing primarily to less
than investment grade retail chains. From 1970 through December 31, 2002, we
have acquired and leased back to regional and national retail chains 1,266
properties (including 116 properties that have been sold) and have collected
approximately 98% of the original contractual rent obligations on those
properties. We believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive
risk-adjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers.

We believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically
include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real
estate lease obligations. Because we own the land and building in which a tenant
conducts its retail business, we believe the risk of default on a retailers'
lease obligations is less than the retailers' unsecured general obligations. It
has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail
locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization, they are less
likely to reject a lease for a profitable location, because this would terminate
their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will
fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of
reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during a reorganization,
we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the
property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real estate
leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers'
individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are
weaker performers.

In order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions
must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must
generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.
We have established a three-part analysis that examines each potential
investment based on:

o    Industry, company, market conditions and credit profile;
o    Location profitability, if profitability data is available; and
o    Overall real estate characteristics, including value and comparative rental
     rates.

The standard profile of companies whose properties have been approved for
acquisition, generally are those with 50 or more retail stores that are located
in highly visible areas, with easy access to major thoroughfares and attractive
demographics.





ACQUISITION STRATEGY. We seek to invest in industries in which several,
well-organized, regional and national chains are capturing market share through
service, quality control, economies of scale, mass media advertising and the
selection of prime retail locations. We execute our acquisition strategy by
acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain stores in a
variety of industries by acquiring then leasing back their retail store
locations. We undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate
industries, tenants and property locations for investment. Our research
expertise is instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where
our real estate financing program adds value. In selecting real estate for
potential investment, we generally seek to acquire properties that have the
following characteristics:

o    Freestanding, commercially-zoned property with a single tenant;
o    Properties that are important retail locations for regional and national
     retail chains;
o    Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to
     the business of their tenants, with high visibility and easy access to
     major thoroughfares; and
o    Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or
     assumption of long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income
     and the potential for rent increases.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. The active management of the property portfolio
is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our
portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries,
tenants and locations in which we have invested. The portfolio is regularly
analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit
quality. Company executives review industry research, tenant research, property
due diligence and significant portfolio management activities. This monitoring
typically includes regular review and analysis of:

o    The performance of various retail industries;
o    The operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the
     tenants; and
o    The health of the individual markets in which we own properties, from both
     an economic and real estate standpoint.

We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate
higher returns, enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio, or
extend our average remaining lease terms. At December 31, 2002, we classified
real estate with a carrying amount of $6.5 million as held for sale. Of this
amount, real estate owned by Crest Net totaled $4.6 million. Additionally, we
anticipate selling properties from our portfolio, which have not yet been
specifically identified. We anticipate receiving between $15 million and
$30 million in proceeds from the sale of properties during the next 12 months.
We intend to invest these proceeds into new retail properties.

CAPITAL MARKETS STRATEGY. We believe our stockholders are best served by a
conservative capital structure. At March 1, 2003, our total outstanding credit
facility borrowings and outstanding notes were $337.1 million or approximately
20.4% of our total market capitalization of $1.65 billion. We define our total
market capitalization as the sum of:

o    The shares of our common stock outstanding multiplied by the last reported
     sales price of the common stock on the NYSE on March 1, 2003 of $34.66 per
     share;
o    The liquidation value of the Class B Preferred Stock;
o    The liquidation value of the Class C Preferred Stock; and
o    Outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and outstanding notes at
     March 1, 2003.

We have a $250 million revolving, unsecured acquisition credit facility that
expires in October 2005. At March 1, 2003, the outstanding balance on the
acquisition credit facility was $107.1 million with an effective interest rate
of approximately 2.4%. A commitment fee of 0.2% per annum accrues on the total
credit commitment of the credit facility. The credit facility has been and is
expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to regional
and national retail chains under long-term net-lease agreements. The credit
facility has also been used to provide capital to subsidiaries for the purpose
of funding the acquisition of properties.






We use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property
acquisitions. When outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a
certain level (generally in the range of $75 to $175 million) and capital is
available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings
with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the
issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, debt
securities or convertible debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that
we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions
prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt
securities upon acceptable terms.

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of
common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes. Over the long-term,
we believe that the majority of our future issuances of securities should be in
the form of common stock. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or
debt securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe
that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering
to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties. In addition, we
may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed
using our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that
we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

We currently are assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our
senior unsecured notes from Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. Currently, Fitch has assigned a rating of BBB,
Moody's has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard & Poor's has assigned a
rating of BBB- to our senior notes. These ratings could change based upon, among
other things, our results of operations and financial condition.

We also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB-, Moody's Investors
Service has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group has
assigned a rating of BB+. These ratings could change based upon, among other
things, our results of operations and financial condition.

Realty Income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated investments in
"special purpose entities", "variable interest entities" or off-balance sheet
financing, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity
contracts or other derivative instruments.

COMPETITIVE STRATEGY. We believe that to successfully pursue our investment
philosophy and strategy, we must seek to maintain the following competitive
advantages:

o    Size and Type of Investment Properties: We believe smaller ($500,000 to
     $10,000,000) net-leased retail properties represent an attractive
     investment opportunity in today's real estate environment. Due to the
     complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively
     small assets, we believe these types of properties have not experienced
     significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield
     reduction experienced by larger income-producing properties. We believe the
     less intensive day-to-day property management required by net-lease
     agreements, coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of
     smaller properties, is an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our
     freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that
     satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally
     need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single
     largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers, our method of
     purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease
     arrangement, allows the retail chain to free up capital.

o    Investment in New Retail Industries: Though we specialize in single-tenant
     properties, we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety
     of retail industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in
     retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we
     find attractive. These characteristics include, but are not limited to,
     retail industries dominated by local store operators where regional and
     national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance
     through consolidation and more efficient operations, as well as take
     advantage of major demographic shifts in the population base.






o    Diversification: Diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type,
     tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of providing
     predictable investment results for our stockholders. Further
     diversification of our portfolio is an objective of the Company. At
     December 31, 2002, our retail property portfolio consisted of 1,197
     properties located in 48 states, leased to 79 retail chains doing business
     in 25 industry segments. At December 31, 2002, all industry segments in our
     property portfolio comprise less than 20% of our annualized rent.

o    Management Specialization: We believe that our management's specialization
     in single-tenant retail properties, operated under net-lease agreements, is
     important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this
     specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals
     in this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.

o    Technology: We intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts
     to efficiently and economically carry out our operations. We maintain
     sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio's
     performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that technology
     and information-based systems will play an increasingly important role in
     our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a
     variety of industries and tenants.


                                   PROPERTIES

At December 31, 2002, we owned a diversified portfolio:

o    Of 1,197 retail properties;
o    With an occupancy rate of 97.7%, or 1,170 properties occupied of the 1,197
     properties in the portfolio;
o    Leased to 79 different retail chains;
o    Doing business in 25 separate retail industries;
o    Located in 48 states;
o    With approximately 10 million square feet of leasable space; and
o    With an average leasable retail space of 8,400 square feet.

In addition to our real estate portfolio at December 31, 2002, our subsidiary,
Crest Net had invested $4.6 million in a portfolio of four properties located in
three states.

At December 31, 2002, 1,165, or 97.3%, of our 1,197 retail properties were owned
under net-lease agreements. Net leases typically require the tenant to be
responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including
property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically
responsible for future rent increases (generally subject to ceilings) based on
increases in the consumer price index, fixed increases or additional rent
calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level.

Our net-leased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national
retail chain store operators. Most buildings are single-story structures with
adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods. The
properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts
and adequate access, egress and proximity to a sufficient population base to
constitute a suitable market or trade area for the retailer's business.





The following table sets forth certain information regarding our properties
classified according to the business of the respective tenants, expressed as a
percentage of our total rental revenue:



Of the 1,197 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2002, 1,192 were
single-tenant properties with the five remaining properties being multi-tenant
properties. At December 31, 2002, 1,165 of the 1,192 single-tenant properties,
or 97.7%, were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding
extension options) of approximately 10.9 years.

DESCRIPTION OF LEASING STRUCTURE. At December 31, 2002, 1,165 or 97.3% of the
Company's 1,197 properties were leased pursuant to net leases. In most cases,
the leases:

o    Were for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with the tenants having one or
     more options to extend the initial term;
o    Require the tenants to pay property taxes, insurance and expenses of
     maintaining the property;
o    Provide for a minimum base rent plus future increases (typically subject to
     ceilings) based on increases in the consumer price index, additional rent
     based upon the tenants' gross sales above a specified level (i.e.,
     percentage rent) or fixed increases. Where leases provide for rent
     increases based on increases in the consumer price index, generally these
     increases permanently become part of the base rent. Where leases provide
     for percentage rent, this additional rent is typically payable only if the
     tenants' gross sales for a given period (usually one year) exceed a
     specified level, and then is typically calculated as a percentage of only
     the amount of gross sales in excess of that level.

MATTERS PERTAINING TO CERTAIN PROPERTIES AND TENANTS. Twenty-seven of our
properties were available for sale or lease at December 31, 2002, all of which
are single-tenant properties. Sixteen of the properties had been previously
leased to child care operators, six to restaurant operators, three to home
improvement operators, one to an automotive service operator and one to a health
care operator. At December 31, 2002, 14 of our properties under lease were
unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current
with their rent and other obligations.

Our largest tenant, Children's World Learning Centers, accounted for
approximately 10.7% of our rental revenue in 2002. No other tenant comprised 9%
or more of our rental revenue. At December 31, 2002, as a result of portfolio
growth through acquisitions during the year, Children's World Learning Centers
accounted for approximately 9.9% of our annualized rent. Annualized rent is
calculated by multiplying the monthly contractual base rent for each of the
properties by 12 and adding the previous 12 month's historic percentage rent,
excluding properties owned by Crest Net. In general, a downturn in the industry
represented by this tenant, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of
the United States, could adversely affect tenants in this industry, which in
turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of
operations, ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to
make debt service payments. In addition, a substantial number of our properties
are leased to middle-market retail chains that generally have more limited
financial and other resources than certain upper-market retail chains, and
therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their
respective business or in the regional or national economy in general.

Our tenants in the child care and restaurant industries accounted for
approximately 20.8% and 13.5%, respectively, of our rental revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2002. A downturn in either of these industries, whether
nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the United States, could adversely
affect tenants in those industries, which in turn could have a material adverse
affect on our financial position, results of operations, ability to make
distributions to stockholders and our ability to make debt service payments. At
December 31, 2002, all industry segments in our property portfolio comprise less
than 20% of our annualized rent.

DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES. Of the 108 properties we acquired in 2002 and
three properties acquired by Crest Net in 2002, all but five were occupied at
March 1, 2003. The five properties were leased and under construction pursuant
to a contract under which the tenant has agreed to develop the properties (with
development costs funded by us or Crest Net) with rent commencing when the
premises open for business. In the case of development properties, we either
enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a
contractor to construct the improvements and we fund the costs of that
development, or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements. In either
case, there is an executed lease at the time of the land purchase and there is a
requirement to complete the construction on a timely basis, generally within





eight months after we purchase the land. The tenant or developer generally is
required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent they exceed the
construction budget by more than a predetermined amount. We also enter into a
lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land, which generally requires
the tenant to begin paying base rent, calculated as a percentage of our
acquisition cost for the property, including construction costs and capitalized
interest, when the premises opens for business. In 2002, we acquired nine
development properties, and Crest Net acquired two development properties, six
of which have been completed, were operating and generating rent as of March 1,
2003. Both Realty Income and Crest Net will continue to pursue development
opportunities under similar arrangements.


                                   OTHER ITEMS

COMPETITION FOR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE.  We face competition in the
acquisition, operation and sale of property.  We expect competition from:

o    Businesses;
o    Individuals;
o    Fiduciary accounts and plans; and
o    Other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial
resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish
to purchase.

The tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other
operators. This competition may adversely impact:

o    That portion, if any, of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a
     tenant's revenues; and
o    The tenants' results of operations or financial condition.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES. Investments in real property can create a potential
for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for
environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous
substances on the property. We face such liability regardless of:

o    Our knowledge of the contamination;
o    The timing of the contamination;
o    The cause of the contamination; or
o    The party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There may be environmental problems, associated with our properties, of which we
are unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators
of oil change and tune-up facilities, and convenience stores that sell
petroleum-based fuels. These facilities, or other of our properties, use, or may
have used in the past, underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or
waste products, which could create a potential for release of hazardous
substances.

The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our
ability to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs.
Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with
all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations and to
indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants'
activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability
by virtue of our ownership interest, and there can be no assurance that our
tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases. The
discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or our
ability to make distributions to stockholders.






We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise
aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous
substances, toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our
present properties. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist,
we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest.

Since December 1996, we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our
property portfolio. The limit on our current policy is $10 million per
occurrence and $50 million in the aggregate, subject to a $25,000 self insurance
retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage tanks and a
$100,000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other properties. It is
possible that our insurance will be insufficient to address any particular
environmental situation and that we will be unable to continue to obtain
insurance for environmental matters in the future at a reasonable cost or at
all.

TAXATION OF THE COMPANY. We believe that we are organized and have operated,
commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and we intend to
continue to operate, so as to qualify as a "real estate investment trust" under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have
satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, that we will continue to
be organized as a REIT or that we have been or will continue to be able to
operate in a manner so that we qualify or will remain qualified as a REIT.

Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under
highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions
to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (as
defined in the Code and determined without regard to the dividends paid
deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of those
qualifications.

If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

o    We would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable
     alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
o    We would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for
     amounts distributed to our stockholders;
o    We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable
     years following the year during which qualification is lost;
o    We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and
o    This treatment would substantially reduce our net earnings available for
     investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax
     liability for the years involved.

Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we are subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a
100% tax. Our subsidiary Crest Net is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property.





EFFECT OF DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. To maintain our status as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our
stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard
to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year.

We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we
distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including net capital
gains) each year.

In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if
any, of certain distributions we pay, with respect to any calendar year, if
those distributions are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that
calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any
amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.

We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with
the distribution requirements of the Code and to reduce exposure to federal
income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the
receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along
with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to
borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that
are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.

DILUTION OF COMMON STOCK. Our future growth will depend in large part upon our
ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital
through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of
holders of our common stock. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to
cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting
and other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the
Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting,
dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely
affect, the interests of holders of our common stock.

REAL ESTATE OWNERSHIP RISKS. We are subject to all of the general risks
associated with the ownership of real estate. In particular, we face the risk
that rental revenue from the properties may be insufficient to cover all
corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and
distributions on our stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:

o    Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;
o    Changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties;
o    Changes in interest rates and operating expenses;
o    Competition for tenants;
o    Changes in market rental rates;
o    Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;
o    Renewal of leases at lower rental rates;
o    Inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship,
     including bankruptcy;
o    Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an
     adverse impact upon the value of real estate;
o    Uninsured property liability;
o    Property damage or casualty losses;
o    Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties
     into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;
o    Acts of terrorism and war; and
o    Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers
and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key
employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

ITEM 7:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     GENERAL

Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company (R), a Maryland
corporation ("Realty Income," the "Company," "our" or "we") was organized to
operate as an equity real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company's
primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions from
a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations ("FFO") per share.
Over the past 33 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring
and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under
long-term (primarily 15 to 20 year) lease agreements. The monthly distributions
are supported by the cash flow from 1,197 retail properties leased to regional
and national retail chains.

We also seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through
both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.
At December 31, 2002, we owned a diversified portfolio:

o    Of 1,197 retail properties;
o    With an occupancy rate of 97.7%, or 1,170 properties occupied of the 1,197
     properties in the portfolio;
o    Leased to 79 different retail chains;
o    Doing business in 25 separate retail industries;
o    Located in 48 states;
o    With approximately 10 million square feet of leasable space; and
o    With an average leasable retail space of 8,400 square feet.

Of the 1,197 properties in the portfolio, 1,192, or 99.6%, are single-tenant
retail properties with the remaining five being multi-tenant properties. As of
December 31, 2002, 1,165, or 97.7%, of the 1,192 single-tenant properties were
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension
options) of approximately 10.9 years.

In addition to our real estate portfolio, at December 31, 2002 our subsidiary,
Crest Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest Net") had invested $4.6 million in a portfolio of
four retail properties located in three states. These properties are held for
sale.

                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH RESERVES. Realty Income is organized to operate as an equity REIT that
acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of
monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated
from leases on its retail properties. We intend to retain an appropriate amount
of cash as working capital. At December 31, 2002, we had cash and cash
equivalents totaling $8.9 million.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from
operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity
needs for the foreseeable future. We intend, however, to use additional sources
of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility.

NEW $250 MILLION BANK CREDIT FACILITY. In October 2002, we entered into a new
$250 million credit facility to replace our existing $200 million acquisition
credit facility and our $25 million credit facility, each of which was scheduled
to expire during 2003. Under the terms of the new credit facility, total funds
available were increased by $25 million. Concurrent with the closing of the new
facility, our previous credit facilities were canceled. At March 1, 2003, the
$250 million credit facility had an outstanding balance of $107.1 million.





The borrowing rate on the new credit facility was reduced compared to the
previous credit facilities. Realty Income's current investment grade credit
ratings provide for financing at LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 90
basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of
110 basis points over LIBOR, as compared to an all-in pricing of 145 basis
points on our previous credit facilities. The term of the new facility extends
through October 2005.

The co-lead Arranger and sole Administrative Agent for the credit facility is
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with The Bank of New York acting as co-lead Arranger and
sole Documentation Agent. They are joined by the Bank of America, N.A. and
Wachovia Bank, National Association as co-Syndication Agents. Five other banks
are also participants in providing the credit facility: AmSouth Bank, Bank of
Montreal, U.S. Bank National Association, BANK ONE, NA and Chevy Chase Bank,
FSB.

This credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail
properties leased to national and regional retail chains under long-term lease
agreements. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest
rate risk. We have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION OF $500 MILLION. In December 2002, we filed a
universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") covering up to $500 million in value of common stock,
preferred stock and debt securities. This registration statement was declared
effective by the SEC in January 2003. Through March 1, 2003, we have not issued
any common stock, preferred stock or debt securities under the universal shelf
registration statement.

ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK IN 2002. In July 2002, we issued 1,550,000 shares of
common stock at a price of $33.40 per share. The net proceeds of $48.9 million
were used to repay borrowings under our $200 million acquisition credit
facility.

In February 2002, we issued 273,150 shares of common stock to a unit investment
trust at a net price to us of $30.26 per share, based on a 5% discount to the
market price at the time of issuance of $31.85 per share. The net proceeds of
$8.2 million were used to repay bank borrowings under our $200 million
acquisition credit facility.

CONSERVATIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURE. We believe that our stockholders are best served
by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a
conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge
coverage ratios. At March 1, 2003, our total outstanding credit facility
borrowings and outstanding notes were $337.1 million or approximately 20.4% of
our total market capitalization of $1.65 billion. We define our total market
capitalization as the sum of the:

o    Shares of our common stock outstanding multiplied by the last reported
     sales price of the common stock on the NYSE on March 1, 2003 of $34.66 per
     share;
o    Liquidation value of the Class B Preferred Stock;
o    Liquidation value of the Class C Preferred Stock; and
o    Outstanding borrowings on the credit facility and outstanding notes at
     March 1, 2003.

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of
common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes. Over the long term,
we believe that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the
form of common stock, however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our
share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be
accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue
common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit
facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have
access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.






CREDIT AGENCY RATINGS. We are currently assigned investment grade corporate
credit ratings, on our senior unsecured notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody's
Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Group. Currently, Fitch
Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody's has assigned a rating of Baa2 and
Standard & Poor's has assigned a rating of BBB- to our senior notes. These
ratings could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations
and financial condition.

We also have received credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB-, Moody's Investor
Service, Inc. has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard & Poor's Rating Group
has assigned a rating of BB+. These ratings could change based upon, among other
things, our results of operations and financial condition.

NOTES OUTSTANDING. In January 1999, we issued $20 million of 8.0% senior notes
due 2009 (the "2009 Notes"). Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semiannually.

In October 1998, we issued $100 million of 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes due
2008 (the "2008 Notes"). Interest on the 2008 Notes is payable monthly.

In May 1997, we issued $110 million of 7.75% senior notes due 2007 (the "2007
Notes"). Interest on the 2007 Notes is payable semiannually.

All of these notes contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on
incurrence of any debt which would cause the Company's debt to total assets
ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which
would cause the Company's secured debt to total assets ratio to exceed 40%;
(iii) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause the Company's
debt service coverage ratio to be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance
at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150% of the Company's
outstanding unsecured debt. The Company has been in compliance with all of these
note covenants since each of the notes were issued.

NO UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS. Realty Income and its subsidiaries have no
unconsolidated investments in "special purpose entities", "variable interest
entities", or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading
activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments.

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. In 2002, we acquired 108 properties (the "New
Properties") located in 24 states and invested $133.3 million in the New
Properties and properties under development, which includes investments of
$3.5 million for properties acquired before 2002. We have committed to pay
estimated unfunded development costs of $9.3 million on properties under
construction at December 31, 2002. In 2002, we capitalized $377,000 for
re-leasing costs and $642,000 for building improvements on existing properties
in our portfolio.

The initial weighted average annual unleveraged return on the $133.3 million
invested in 2002 is estimated to be 10.4%, computed as estimated contractual net
operating income (which in the case of a net-leased property is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of properties under construction, the estimated base
rent under the lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated
total costs. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above.

The New Properties are expected to contain approximately 719,800 leasable square
feet and are 100% leased under net leases, with an average initial lease term of
19.8 years. At December 31, 2002, six of the New Properties were leased and
under construction, pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to
develop the properties (with development costs funded by Realty Income), with
rent scheduled to begin during 2003.






In 2001, we acquired 91 properties (the "2001 Properties") and invested
$131.8 million in the 2001 Properties and properties under development. In 2001,
we also paid $401,000 for re-leasing costs and $547,000 for building
improvements on existing properties in our portfolio. The initial weighted
average annual unleveraged return on the $131.8 million invested in 2001 is
estimated to be 11.0%, computed in the same manner as 2002's estimated initial
weighted average annual unleveraged return and subject to the same possible
outcome described above. These 91 properties contain approximately 877,200
leasable square feet and are 100% leased under net leases, with an average
initial lease term of 20.1 years.

DISTRIBUTIONS. We pay monthly cash distributions to our common stockholders. We
paid aggregate distributions to our common stockholders of $78.0 million in
2002, $64.9 million in 2001 and $58.3 million in 2000.

We pay quarterly cash distributions to our Class B preferred stockholders. We
paid aggregate distributions to our Class B preferred stockholders of
$6.4 million in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000.

We pay monthly cash distributions to our Class C preferred stockholders. We paid
aggregate distributions to our Class C preferred stockholders of $3.3 million in
each of 2002, 2001 and 2000.

CREST NET. We formed Crest Net in January 2000 to purchase, own and sell
properties, primarily to buyers using tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Realty Income
owns 100% of Crest Net's stock. The financial statements of Crest Net are
consolidated into Realty Income's financial statements. All material
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In 2002, Crest Net invested $6.1 million in three retail properties. These three
properties are expected to contain approximately 13,200 leasable square feet,
are 100% leased and have initial lease terms averaging 18.4 years. Two of these
properties were sold in 2002.

In 2001, Crest Net invested $24.7 million in 26 retail properties. These 26
properties contain approximately 102,300 leasable square feet, are 100% leased
and have initial lease terms averaging 20.1 years. Twenty-three of these
properties were sold during 2001 and 2002.

In 2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties from its inventory for $27.3 million and
Realty Income recorded a gain of $3.5 million, before income taxes. At the end
of 2002, Crest Net carried an inventory of $4.6 million, which is included on
Realty Income's consolidated balance sheet in real estate held for sale, net.

In 2002, Crest Net generated $2.7 million in funds from operations for Realty
Income. The contribution, if any, to our FFO by Crest Net will depend on the
timing and the number of property sales achieved by Crest Net, if any, in a
given year.

In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties from its inventory for $28.9 million and
we recorded a gain of $3.4 million, before income taxes. In 2001, Crest Net
generated $2.4 million in funds from operations for Realty Income.

STOCK AND SENIOR DEBT PURCHASE PROGRAM. In January 2000, our Board of Directors
authorized the purchase of up to $10 million of our outstanding common and
preferred shares and senior debt securities. From time to time since January
2000, we concluded our share price justified purchasing shares since this
provided an attractive return on our investment capital. We purchased an
aggregate of $6.7 million of our securities since January 2000. We did not
purchase any of our securities in 2002.





                          FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ("FFO")

FFO for 2002 increased by $17.3 million, or 22.2%, to $95.1 million versus
$77.8 million in 2001. FFO in 2000 was $67.2 million. The following is a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe
is the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")
measure) to FFO and information regarding distributions paid and the diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2002, 2001 and 2000 (dollars
in thousands):



We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trust's definition, as net income available to common
stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant
to the real estate industry, reduced by gains and increased by losses on (i)
sales of investment property and provisions for impairment and (ii)
extraordinary items.


                     ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ("AFFO")

We utilize AFFO as a non-GAAP measure of our cash available for distributions to
our common stockholders. Most companies in our industry use a similar
measurement, but they may use the term "CAD" (for Cash Available for
Distribution) or "FAD" (for Funds Available for Distribution). We define AFFO as
funds from operations: (i) plus certain non-cash items (including amortization
of treasury lock settlements, note financing costs and stock compensation), (ii)
minus capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio (such as
capitalized re-leasing costs and commissions and capitalized building
improvements), and (iii) plus or minus straight-line rent (which is non-cash
rental revenue).





AFFO for 2002 increased by $17.3 million, or 22.0%, to $95.8 million versus
$78.5 million in 2001. AFFO in 2000 was $67.8 million. The following is a
reconciliation of FFO to AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000. The adjustments are for non-cash items and capitalized expenditures on
existing properties in our portfolio (dollars in thousands):



We consider FFO and AFFO to be appropriate Non-GAAP measures of the performance
of equity REITs. Financial analysts use FFO and AFFO in evaluating REITs. FFO
and AFFO can be a way to measure a REIT's ability to make cash distribution
payments. Presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in
comparing the performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that
not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO the same way; therefore, comparisons with
other REITs may not be meaningful.

FFO and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash
needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an
indication of Realty Income's performance. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not
be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity, of our ability to
make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments.






                           FFO GENERATED BY CREST NET

Crest Net generated $2.7 million in FFO for Realty Income in 2002, $2.4 million
in 2001 and $0.4 million in 2000. The following is a calculation of Crest Net's
FFO contribution to Realty Income for 2002, 2001 and 2000 (dollars in
thousands):



                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management is required to make a number of assumptions and estimates that
directly impact the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Those assumptions and estimates are the basis for certain of our accounting
policies described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The
accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's
financial condition and results of operations, and require management's most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments, are considered to be critical
accounting policies. Because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions
and estimates regarding unknown future outcomes, events may result in
significant differences between our estimates and actual results. Management
believes that each of our assumptions and estimates are appropriate under the
circumstances and represent the most likely outcome. We believe our most
critical accounting policies relate to depreciable lives of our real estate
assets and recoverability (impairment) of our real estate assets.

THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

RENTAL REVENUE was $137.1 million for 2002 versus $119.7 million for 2001, an
increase of $17.4 million, or 14.5%. The increase in rental revenue is
attributable to:

o    The 108 properties acquired in 2002, which generated revenue of
     $6.4 million;
o    The 91 properties acquired in 2001, which generated revenue of
     $13.9 million in 2002 compared to $2.9 million in 2001, an increase of
     $11.0 million;
o    Properties owned by Crest Net, which generated revenue of $1.4 million in
     2002 compared to $1.8 million in 2001, a decrease of $0.4 million;
o    Properties sold during 2002 and 2001, which generated rental revenue of
     $44,000 in 2002 as compared to $1.87 million in 2001, a decrease of
     $1.83 million (excluding rental revenue included in discontinued
     operations);
o    Development properties acquired before 2001 that started paying rent in
     2001, properties that were vacant during part of 2002 or 2001,
     straight-line rent and lease termination settlements that generated revenue
     of $5.3 million in 2002 as compared to $4.6 million in 2001, an increase of
     $0.7 million; and
o    Same store rents generated on 950 leased properties owned in all of both
     2002 and 2001 increased by $1.45 million, or 1.3%, to $109.97 million from
     $108.52 million.





Of the 1,197 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2002, 1,192, or 99.6%,
are single-tenant properties with the remaining properties being multi-tenant
properties. Of the 1,192 single-tenant properties, 1,165, or 97.7%, were net
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension
options) of approximately 10.9 years at December 31, 2002. Of our 1,165 leased
single-tenant properties, 1,102, or 94.6%, were under leases that provide for
increases in rents through:

o    Base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment
     ceilings;
o    Overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants' gross sales;
o    Fixed increases; or
o    A combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $1.6 million in 2002
and $1.7 million in 2001.

Our portfolio of retail real estate, owned under net leases, continues to
perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of
monthly dividends. At December 31, 2002, our property portfolio consisting of
1,197 retail properties, was 97.7% leased with only 27 properties available for
lease.

Transactions to lease or sell 13 of the 27 properties available for lease or
sale at December 31, 2002 were underway or completed as of March 1, 2003. We
anticipate these transactions to be completed during the next six months,
although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be sold or leased
within this period. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 3% of
our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however,
we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not
exceed these levels.

GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED FOR RESALE. In 2002, Crest Net sold 23
properties for $27.3 million and Realty Income recognized a gain on the sales of
$3.5 million, before income taxes. In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties for
$28.9 million and Realty Income recognized a gain on the sales of $3.4 million,
before income taxes.

At December 31, 2002, Crest Net had $4.6 million invested in four properties,
which are held for sale. It is Crest Net's intent to carry an average inventory
of between $20 million to $25 million in real estate. We anticipate Crest Net's
level of inventory increasing during 2003. Crest Net generates an earnings
spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives and the cost of
capital used to acquire its properties. This earnings spread on Crest Net's
inventory covers the ongoing operating expenses of Crest Net.

INTEREST EXPENSE. The following is a summary of the five components of interest
expense for 2002 and 2001 (dollars in thousands):








Interest on outstanding loans and notes was $3.3 million lower in 2002 than in
2001 primarily due to a decrease of 100 basis points in our average interest
rate. The average interest rate on our credit facilities decreased to 2.96% in
2002 from 6.36% in 2001. Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve decreased
the federal funds rate 12 times. Correspondingly, the average borrowing rate on
our credit facilities declined during the same period. Unamortized fees of
$406,000 relating to our canceled credit facilities were charged to interest
expense in October 2002.

At March 1, 2003, the weighted average interest rate on our:

o    Credit facility borrowings of $107.1 million was 2.43%;
o    Notes payable of $230 million was 7.99%; and
o    Combined outstanding credit facility and notes of $337.1 million was 6.22%.

INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. Our interest rate coverage for 2002 was 5.5 times and
for 2001 was 4.4 times. Interest coverage ratio is calculated as: EBITDA divided
by interest expense. EBITDA is calculated as follows: net income plus interest
expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses less
gain on sales of investment properties. Our EBITDA for the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001 was $130.2 million and $115.9 million, respectively. This
information should not be considered as an alternative to any GAAP performance
measures. Our calculation of EBITDA may be different from the calculation used
by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. The following
is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA for 2002 and 2001 (dollars in
thousands):



FIXED COVERAGE RATIO. Our fixed coverage ratio for 2002 was 3.9 times and for
2001 was 3.2 times. Fixed coverage ratio is calculated as follows: EBITDA
divided by the sum of interest expense and preferred stock dividends. This
information should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP performance
measures.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION was $30.8 million in 2002 versus $28.4 million in
2001. The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition
of properties in 2001 and 2002, which was offset by property sales in 2001 and
2002. Depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the
straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years. If we used a
shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our
results of operations and financial position. We believe that 25 years is an
appropriate estimate of useful life. No depreciation has been recorded on Crest
Net's properties because they are held for sale.





Amortization expense related to goodwill for 2001 was $924,000. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, effective January 2002, our goodwill is no longer amortized,
but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually. If goodwill is
determined to be impaired, a provision for impairment will be recorded to reduce
the carrying value to its fair value. During the second quarter of 2002, we
completed the transitional impairment testing of our goodwill and found that our
goodwill was not impaired.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES increased by $1.7 million to $9.5 million in
2002 versus $7.8 million in 2001. General and administrative expenses as a
percentage of total revenue increased to 6.7% in 2002 as compared to 6.3% in
2001. Included in general and administrative expenses are $410,000 and $496,000
of expenses attributable to Crest Net in 2002 and 2001, respectively. General
and administrative expenses, excluding expenses attributable to Crest Net,
increased primarily due to increases in corporate insurance, payroll costs and
staffing.

We had 56 employees at March 1, 2003 compared to 53 employees at March 1, 2002.

PROPERTY EXPENSES are broken down into costs associated with non-net leased
multi-tenant properties, unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio
expenses. Expenses related to the multi-tenant and unleased single-tenant
properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance,
insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees.
General portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal,
property inspections and title search fees. At December 31, 2002, 27 properties
were available for lease, as compared to 20 at December 31, 2001.

Property expenses were $2.7 million in 2002 and $2.4 million in 2001. The
$300,000 increase in property expenses is primarily attributable to an increase
in portfolio property insurance and costs associated with properties available
for lease.

OTHER EXPENSES were $1.7 million in 2002 and $1.8 million in 2001. The following
is a summary of our other expenses in 2002 and 2001 (dollars in thousands):



A PROVISION FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSS of $1.3 million was recorded in 2002, and is
included in discontinued operations. A provision for impairment loss of
$1.5 million was recorded in 2001. We review long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a provision is made for impairment
loss if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the
current book value. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the
current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The
carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated
balance sheet. If events should occur that required us to reduce the carrying
value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses, it could
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES. In 2002, we sold or exchanged 35
properties for a total of $20.2 million and recognized a gain of $6.3 million.
Of this gain, $6.0 million is included in income from discontinued operations.
In 2001, we sold 35 properties for a total of $39.5 million and recognized a
gain of $10.5 million. The gain recognized from property sales in 2002 was
$4.2 million less than the gain recognized from property sales in 2001.






INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Effective January 1, 2002, Statement No. 144
superseded Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. Statement No. 144 requires
long-lived assets to be disposed of to be measured at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell on our balance sheet. It also broadened
the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include a component of
an entity rather than a segment of a business. Statement No. 144 states that a
component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that clearly can be
distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest
of the entity. In accordance with Statement No. 144, we report each individual
property as a reporting component for determining discontinued operations. Four
properties listed as held for sale at December 31, 2002, plus 32 properties sold
during 2002 were reported as discontinued operations. As required by Statement
No. 144, three other properties reported as held for sale at December 31, 2001,
that were sold during 2002, were not reported as discontinued operations.

The following is a summary of our income from discontinued operations for 2002
and 2001 (dollars in thousands):



We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate
higher returns, enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or
extend our average remaining lease term. At December 31, 2002, we classified
real estate with a carrying amount of $6.5 million as held for sale, which
includes $4.6 million in properties owned by Crest Net. Additionally, we
anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet
been specifically identified. We anticipate we will receive between $15 million
and $30 million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties during the
next 12 months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property
acquisitions.

PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS. We paid preferred stock dividends of $9.7 million in
both 2002 and 2001.

NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS in 2002 increased by $11.2 million,
or 19.4%, to $69.0 million versus $57.8 million in 2001.

The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders
includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties. The amount of
gains and losses varies from year to year based on the timing of property sales
and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2002 was
$6.3 million. This was $4.2 million less than the gain recognized from
investment property sales during 2001. Excluding the gain on sales of investment
properties, net income available to common stockholders increased by
$15.4 million, or 32.6%.





THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000.

RENTAL REVENUE was $119.7 million for 2001 versus $114.7 million for 2000, an
increase of $5.0 million, or 4.4%. The increase in rental revenue is
attributable to:

o    The 91 properties acquired in 2001, which generated revenue of
     $2.9 million;
o    The 13 properties acquired in 2000, which generated revenue of $6.0 million
     in 2001 compared to $1.7 million in 2000, an increase of $4.3 million;
o    Properties owned by Crest Net, which generated revenue of $1.8 million in
     2001 compared to $1.2 million in 2000, an increase of $588,000;
o    Properties sold during 2000 and 2001, which generated revenue of
     $1.4 million in 2001 as compared to $7.0 million in 2000, a decrease of
     $5.6 million;
o    Net rental increase of $900,000 on development properties acquired before
     2000 that started paying rent in 2000 and properties that were vacant
     during part of 2000 or 2001; and
o    Same store rents generated on 977 leased properties owned in all of both
     2001 and 2000 increased by $1.8 million, or 1.8%, to $105.24 million from
     $103.41 million.

Percentage rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $1.7 million in 2001
and $2.0 million in 2000.

GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED FOR RESALE. In 2001, Crest Net sold nine
properties for $28.9 million and we recognized a gain of $3.4 million, before
income taxes. In 2000, Crest Net sold two properties for $6.2 million and we
recognized a gain of $766,000, before income taxes.

INTEREST EXPENSE. The following is a summary of the five components of interest
expense for 2001 and 2000 (dollars in thousands):



Interest on outstanding loans and notes was $5.8 million lower in 2001 than in
2000 primarily due to a decrease of $58.9 million in the average outstanding
balances and a decrease of 35 basis points in our average interest rate. The
average interest rate on our credit facilities decreased to 6.36% in 2001 from
7.67% in 2000. The majority of our credit facilities interest rate reductions in
2001 occurred during the second half of the 2001. In 2001, the Federal Reserve
decreased the federal funds rate 11 times by an aggregate total of 475 basis
points. Correspondingly, the average borrowing rate on our credit facilities
declined during the same period.





INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. Our interest coverage ratio for 2001 was 4.4 times and
for 2000 was 3.5 times. Our EBITDA (as defined above) for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $115.9 million and $109.4 million, respectively.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA for 2001 and 2000
(dollars in thousands):



FIXED COVERAGE RATIO.  Our fixed coverage ratio (as defined above) for 2001 was
3.2 times and for 2000 was 2.7 times.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION was $28.4 million in 2001 versus $28.3 million in
2000. Amortization of goodwill for each of the years 2001 and 2000 was $924,000.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES increased by $996,000 to $7.8 million in
2001 versus $6.8 million in 2000. General and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenue increased to 6.3% in 2001 as compared to 5.9% in 2000.
Included in general and administrative expenses are $496,000 and $333,000 of
expenses attributable to Crest Net in 2001 and 2000, respectively. General and
administrative expenses, excluding expenses attributable to Crest Net, increased
primarily due to increases in the cost of living, which includes increases in
payroll costs.

We had 53 employees at March 1, 2002 compared to 49 employees at March 1, 2001.

PROPERTY EXPENSES were $2.4 million in 2001 and $2.0 million in 2000. The
$400,000 increase in property expenses is primarily attributable to an increase
in portfolio property insurance and costs associated with properties available
for lease.

OTHER EXPENSES were $1.8 million in 2001 and $807,000 in 2000. The increase in
2001 is primarily attributable to an increase in Crest Net income taxes. The
following is a summary of our other expenses in 2001 and 2000 (dollars in
thousands):







A PROVISION FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSS of $1.5 million was recorded in 2001. No
provision for impairment loss was recorded in 2000.

GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES. In 2001, we sold 35 properties for a
total of $39.5 million and recognized a gain of $10.5 million. In 2000, we sold
21 properties for a total of $45.2 million and recognized a gain of
$6.7 million. Included in the 21 properties sold in 2000, are two properties,
valued at $22.7 million, leased by one of our tenants that we exchanged for two
other properties owned by that tenant. The gain recognized from property sales
in 2001 was $10.5 million, or $3.8 million greater than the gain recognized from
property sales in 2000 of $6.7 million.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. Four properties listed as held for sale at
December 31, 2002, plus 32 properties sold during 2002 were reported as
discontinued operations. The following is a summary of our income from
discontinued operations for 2001 and 2000 (dollars in thousands):



PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS. We paid preferred stock dividends of $9.7 million in
both 2001 and 2000.

NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS in 2001 increased by $12.7 million
to $57.8 million versus $45.1 million in 2000.


                               IMPACT OF INFLATION

Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of
increases in the tenants' sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index,
and/or fixed increases. We expect that inflation will cause these lease
provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is
greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases
may not keep up with the rate of inflation.

Approximately 97.3%, or 1,165, of the 1,197 properties in the portfolio are
leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property
costs and expenses. These lease features reduce our exposure to rising property
expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse
impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed their
increases in revenue.


                       IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

A. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, Accounting and Disclosure for
Guarantees. FIN No. 45 addresses certain guarantees and the initial recognition,
measurement and disclosure at inception of the guarantee. The impact of adopting
FIN No. 45 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position
or results of operations.






B. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Certain
Variable Interest Entities. FIN No. 46 requires consolidation of a variable
interest entity by an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest.
The impact of adopting FIN No. 46 is not expected to have a material effect on
our financial position or results of operations.


ITEM 7A:  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
          ----------------------------------------------------------

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit
facility and long-term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real
estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management
objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives we
issue long-term notes, primarily at fixed rates, and may selectively enter into
derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements, interest
rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument. We were not a party to any derivative financial
instruments at December 31, 2002. We do not enter into any transactions for
speculative or trading purposes.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table
below presents the principal amounts, weighted average interest rates, fair
values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the
expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in table
in millions):



The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2002;
it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that
date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest
rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period,
our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.






ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Schedules not filed: All schedules, other than that indicated in the Table of
Contents, have been omitted as the required information is inapplicable or the
information is presented in the financial statements or related notes.







                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Realty Income Corporation:


We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Realty Income
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying table of contents. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule III as listed in the accompanying
table of contents. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Realty Income
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                        December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000


1.   ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION

Realty Income Corporation ("Realty Income," the "Company," "we" or "our") is
organized as a Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial retail real estate
and have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). At
December 31, 2002, we owned 1,197 properties in 48 states containing
approximately 10 million leasable square feet, excluding four properties owned
by our subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest Net").


2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRS Code"). We believe Realty Income has
qualified and continues to qualify as a REIT and therefore will be permitted to
deduct distributions paid to its stockholders, eliminating the federal taxation
of income represented by those distributions at the Company's level.
Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, except for federal income taxes
of Crest Net, which totaled $1.0 million, $1.2 million and $264,000 in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively, and which are included in other expenses.

EARNINGS AND PROFITS, which determine the taxability of distributions to
stockholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes
due to differences for IRS Code purposes in the estimated useful lives and
methods used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis) on the
investments in properties, among other things.

The following reconciles our net income available to common stockholders to
taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands)
(unaudited):

Net income available to common stockholders                            $ 68,954
Tax loss on the sale of real estate less than book gain                  (8,850)
Elimination of net revenue and expenses from Crest Net                   (2,586)
Dividends received from Crest Net                                         2,300
Preferred dividends not deductible for tax                                9,713
Depreciation and amortization timing differences                         10,085
Impairment losses                                                         1,320
Other adjustments                                                         1,117
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Estimated taxable net income                                           $ 82,053
================================================================================

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE. Basic net income per common share is computed by
dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per
common share is computed by dividing the amount of net income available to
common stockholders for the period by the number of common shares that would
have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.






The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per
common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common
share computation, for the years ended December 31:



In 2002 and 2001, no stock options were anti-dilutive. In 2000, 296,653 stock
options were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the incremental shares
from the assumed exercise of stock options.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Effective January 1, 2002, Statement No. 144
superseded Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. Statement No. 144 requires
long-lived assets to be disposed of to be measured on our balance sheet at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. It also broadened the
reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include a component of an
entity rather than a segment of a business. Statement No. 144 states that a
component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly
distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest
of the entity. In accordance with Statement No. 144, we report each individual
property as a reporting component for determining discontinued operations. The
operations of four properties listed as held for sale at December 31, 2002, plus
32 properties sold during 2002 were reported as income from discontinued
operations in 2002, and their respective 2001 and 2000 results of operations
were reclassified to income from discontinued operations. As required by
Statement No. 144, three other properties reported as held for sale at December
31, 2001 that were sold during 2002 were not reported as discontinued
operations.

The following is a summary of our income from discontinued operations for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (dollars in thousands):







LEASES. All leases are accounted for as operating leases. Under this method,
lease payments that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on
a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any rent revenue contingent upon a
tenant's sales is recognized only after the tenants exceed their sales
breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indexes
are recognized only after the changes in the indexes have occurred, and then
applied according to the lease agreements.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest Net and other entities for which we
make operational and financial decisions (control), after elimination of all
material inter company balances and transactions.

CASH EQUIVALENTS. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation of buildings and improvements and
amortization of goodwill are computed using the straight-line method over an
estimated useful life of 25 years.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. Replacements and betterments are capitalized.

PROVISION FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. We review long-lived assets, including
goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a
provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds
(undiscounted) are less than the current book value. Impairment loss is measured
as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower
of cost or estimated fair value, less cost to sell. Provisions for impairment
losses of $1.3 million and $1.5 million were recorded in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. No provision for impairment loss was recorded in 2000.

STOCK OPTION PLAN. Prior to 2002 we accounted for our stock option plan in
accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issues to Employees and related interpretations. No stock option-based
compensation cost was reflected in 2001 or 2000 net income, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and beginning in 2002 started expensing the costs for all stock
option awards granted, modified, or settled after January 1, 2002. Stock option
awards under the plan vest over periods ranging from one to five years.
Therefore, the cost related to stock option-based compensation included in the
determination of net income available to common stockholders is less than that
which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied
to all stock option awards since the original effective date of Statement No.
123.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income available to common
stockholders and earnings per share if the fair based method had been applied to
all outstanding and unvested awards in each period (dollars in thousands, except
per share amounts).







GOODWILL. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. This statement changed the accounting for goodwill from an
amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Under Statement No. 142,
goodwill will be tested for impairment annually and also whenever events or
circumstances occur that indicate that our goodwill might be impaired. We
adopted the provisions of Statement No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and ceased
amortizing our goodwill, which totaled $17.2 million. During the second quarter
of 2002, we completed the transitional impairment testing of our goodwill and
found that our goodwill was not impaired. We did not have any new goodwill or
record an impairment loss on our existing goodwill during 2002. Amortization of
goodwill for each of the years 2001 and 2000 was $924,000. We do not have any
intangible assets as contemplated under Statement No. 142 or unamortized
negative goodwill.

The following table reconciles reported net income available to common
stockholders to adjusted net income available to common stockholders. It
excludes the effect of goodwill amortization expense that is no longer amortized
under Statement No. 142 (in thousands, except per share data):



USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Management believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important
to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations,
in that they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, form the basis of the accounting policies deemed to be most critical
to the Company. These critical accounting policies relate to depreciable lives
of our real estate assets and recoverability (impairment) of our real estate
assets. We believe our estimates and assumptions related to these critical
accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances; however, should
future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences, there could
be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.

RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain of the 2001 and 2000 balances have been reclassified
to conform to the 2002 presentation.






3.   PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS

A. In 2002, we invested $133.3 million in 108 new retail properties and
properties under development with an average initial contractual lease rate of
10.4%. We have committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs of
$9.3 million on properties under construction at December 31, 2002. In 2001, we
invested $131.8 million in 91 new retail properties and properties under
development with an average initial contractual lease rate of 11.0%.

B. In 2002, Crest Net invested $6.1 million in three new retail properties and
properties under development. In 2001, Crest Net invested $24.7 million in 26
new retail properties and properties under development. At December 31, 2002 and
2001, investments in properties owned by Crest Net, totaled $4.6 million and
$22.3 million, respectively, and are included in real estate held for sale, net,
on our consolidated balance sheets.


4.   INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY

In January 2000, we acquired 95% of the common stock of Crest Net, all of which
is non-voting, and certain members of our management and Crest Net management
acquired 5% of the common stock, all of which is voting stock. In May 2001, we
acquired the 5% of common stock of Crest Net owned by certain members of our
management and management of Crest Net for $507,000. The acquisition of the 5%
of common stock was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. After
this transaction, Realty Income owns 100% of the stock of Crest Net. Crest Net
was created to buy, own and sell properties, primarily to buyers using
tax-deferred exchanges, under Section 1031 of the IRS Code.


5.   CREDIT FACILITIES

In October 2002, we entered into a new $250 million credit facility to replace
our existing $200 million acquisition credit facility and our $25 million credit
facility, each of which was scheduled to expire in 2003. Under the terms of the
new credit facility, total funds available were increased by $25 million.
Concurrent with the closing of the new $250 million credit facility, our
previous $225 million credit facilities were canceled. Unamortized fees of
$406,000 relating to our canceled credit facilities were charged to interest
expense in 2002.

The borrowing rate on the new $250 million credit facility was reduced compared
to the previous credit facilities. As of December 31, 2002, Realty Income's
investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR (London
Interbank Offered Rate) plus 100 basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis
points, for all-in drawn pricing of 120 basis points over LIBOR as compared to
an all-in pricing of 145 basis points on our previous credit facilities. The
term of the new facility extends through October 2005.

Effective March 1, 2003, Realty Income's investment grade credit ratings
provide for financing at a reduced rate of LIBOR plus 90 basis points with a
facility fee of 20 basis points.

The average borrowing rate on our credit facilities during 2002 was 3.0% or 340
basis points lower than our average borrowing rate during 2001 of 6.4%. Our
current credit facility and previous credit facilities are subject to various
leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations. The Company is and has been in
compliance with these covenants.

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, interest of $511,000, $385,000 and $1.0 million,
respectively, was capitalized with respect to properties under development.


6.   NOTES PAYABLE

In January 1999, we issued $20 million of 8.0% senior notes due 2009 (the "2009
Notes"). The 2009 Notes are unsecured and were sold at 98.757% of par. Interest
on the 2009 Notes is payable semiannually.






In October 1998, we issued $100 million of 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes due
2008 (the "2008 Notes"). The 2008 Notes are unsecured and were sold at par
($25.00). In May 1998, we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement
associated with the 2008 Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we made a
payment of $8.7 million in 1998. The payment on the agreement is being amortized
over 10 years (the life of the 2008 Notes) as a yield adjustment to interest
expense. After taking into effect the results of a treasury interest rate lock
agreement, the effective rate to us on the 2008 Notes is 9.12%. Interest on the
2008 Notes is payable monthly.

In May 1997, we issued $110 million of 7.75% senior notes due 2007 (the "2007
Notes"). The 2007 Notes are unsecured and were sold at 99.929% of par. In
December 1996, we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement
associated with the 2007 Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we received
$1.1 million in 1997. The payment received on the agreement is being amortized
over 10 years (the life of the 2007 Notes) as a yield adjustment to interest
expense. After taking into effect the results of a treasury interest rate lock

10.  OPERATING LEASES

A. At December 31, 2002, we owned 1,197 properties in 48 states, excluding
properties owned by Crest Net. Of these 1,197 properties, 1,192 are
single-tenant and the remainder are multi-tenant. At December 31, 2002, 27
properties were vacant and available for lease or sale.

Substantially all leases are net leases whereby the tenant pays property taxes
and assessments, maintains the interior and exterior of the building and leased
premises, and carries insurance coverage for public liability, property damage,
fire and extended coverage.

Percentage rent for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1.6 million, $1.7 million and
$2.0 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2002, minimum annual rents to be received on the operating
leases are as follows (dollars in thousands):

                     For the years ending December 31,

                TOTAL                     $    1,503,749
 =======================================================================

B. Major Tenants - The following schedule presents rental revenue, including
percentage rents, from tenants representing more than 10% of our total revenue
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 or 2000 (dollars in thousands):




11.  GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED FOR RESALE

In 2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties for $27.3 million. We recognized a gain of
$3.5 million, before income taxes, on the sales of these properties.

In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties for $28.9 million. We recognized a gain
of $3.4 million, before income taxes, on the sales of these properties.






In 2000, Crest Net sold two properties for $6.2 million. We recognized a gain of
$766,000, before income taxes, on the sales of these properties.


12.  GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES

In 2002, we sold or exchanged 35 properties for $20.2 million and recognized a
gain of $6.3 million. Included in the 35 properties was one property leased by
one of our tenants that we exchanged for another property owned by that tenant
(see note 14B).

In 2001, we sold 35 properties for $39.5 million and recognized a gain of
$10.5 million.

In 2000, we sold or exchanged 21 properties for $45.2 million and recognized a
gain of $6.7 million. Included in the 21 properties were two properties leased
by one of our tenants that we exchanged for two other properties owned by that
tenant for no gain (see note 14B).


13.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that the carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets
at December 31, 2002 and 2001 reasonably approximate the fair values for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and all liabilities, due to their
short-term nature, except for lines of credit payable and notes payable. In
making these assessments, we used estimates. The fair value of the lines of
credit payable approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to
those available in the market place. The fair value of the notes payable at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 is estimated to be $250.6 million and $230.1 million,
respectively, based upon the closing market price per note or indicative price
per each note at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


14.  SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $21.4 million, $25.3 million and
$29.8 million, respectively.

Income taxes paid by Realty Income and Crest Net in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were
$1.7 million, $1.8 million and $807,000, respectively.

The following non-cash investing and financing activities are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):

A. Additions to properties resulted in the following:

                                                              ----
         Buildings                                           $ 421

B. In 2002, we exchanged one property leased by one of our tenants for another
property owned by that tenant. In 2000, we exchanged two properties leased by
one of our tenants for two other properties owned by that tenant. These
transactions resulted in the following:

                                                              2002        2000

         Accumulated depreciation                                3         645
         Gain on sale                                           (2)         --





C. In 2001, acquisition of the 5% of Crest Net common stock not previously owned
by Realty Income resulted in the following:

         Accounts receivable                                 $(450)
         Accounts payable and accrued expenses                (450)

D. In 2001, we reclassified unamortized amounts of restricted stock grants
included in other assets to deferred stock compensation (reported as a component
of common stock and paid in capital), which resulted in the following:

         Other assets                                        $(376)
         Deferred stock compensation                           376

E. Restricted stock grants resulted in the following:


F. Restricted stock forfeitures resulted in the following:

                                                                    ----
         Other assets                                            $   (49)
         Common stock and paid in capital                            (49)


15.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

We have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our employees. Under our
401(k) plan, employees may elect to make contributions to the plan up to a
maximum of 15% of their compensation, subject to limits under the IRS Code. We
match 50% of our employee's contributions, up to 3% of the employee's
compensation. Our aggregate matching contributions each year has been immaterial
to our results of operations.


16.  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

In 1993, our Board of Directors approved a stock incentive plan (the "Stock
Plan") designed to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the
Company by enabling those individuals to participate in the ownership of the
Company. The Stock Plan authorizes the issuance in each calendar year of up to
3% of the total shares outstanding at the end of such year. The Stock Plan
provides for grants of up to 1,950,308 shares. The Stock Plan provides for the
award (subject to ownership limitations) of a broad variety of stock-based
compensation alternatives such as nonqualified stock options, incentive stock
options, restricted stock and performance awards.

Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock's
fair market value at the date of grant. Stock options expire ten years from the
date they are granted and vest over service periods of one, three, four and five
years.

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company issued 110,572 shares, 61,500 shares and
17,800 shares of restricted stock, respectively, which vest over periods ranging
from five years to ten years. The weighted average fair market values of the
restricted stock issued in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $29.89, $25.43 and $21.15,
respectively.





The following table summarizes our stock option activity for the years 2002,
2001 and 2000:



At December 31, 2002, the options outstanding under the Stock Plan had exercise
prices ranging from $20.00 to $29.40 with a weighted average price of $24.02,
and expiration dates ranging from August 2004 to December 2011 with a weighted
average remaining term of 5.2 years. At December 31, 2002, the options
exercisable under the Stock Plan had exercise prices ranging from $20.00 to
$29.40 with a weighted average price of $23.13.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated at the date of grant
using the binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

                                               2002                 2000
                                        ----------------------------------------
Expected dividend yield                        9.76%                9.70%
Risk-free interest rate                        5.09%                6.30%
Volatility                                    18.18%               15.00%
Expected life of options                    10 years             10 years


17.  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

In 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the "Rights
Plan") that will expire in July 2008. The Rights Plan assigns one right (a
"Right") to purchase one one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of our Class A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, for each share
of common stock owned on or issued after July 1, 1998. Currently, the Rights are
not exercisable and do not trade separately from our common stock.

Under specified circumstances, stockholders will be able to exercise their
Rights if a person or group acquires 15% of our common stock or makes a tender
offer to acquire 15% or more of our common stock. In these circumstances,
stockholders other than the acquirer would be able to exercise the Rights to
purchase our common stock or, in some situations, the acquirer's stock at a 50%
discount.







18.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

We evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by
industry basis. For financial reporting purposes, we have grouped our tenants
into 12 reportable industry segments, except for properties owned by Crest Net
that are grouped together and included in "other non-reportable segments." All
of the properties are incorporated into one of the applicable segments. Because
almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating expenses, revenue
is the only component of segment profit and loss we measure.

The following tables set forth certain information regarding the properties
owned by us, classified according to the business of the respective tenants as
of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands):












19.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary course of our business, we are party to various legal actions
which we believe are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our
business. We believe that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect upon our consolidated statements taken as a whole.

PART IV

Item 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE. We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and
15d-14(c)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures.

Within 90 days prior to the date of this annual report, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore no corrective actions were
taken.
