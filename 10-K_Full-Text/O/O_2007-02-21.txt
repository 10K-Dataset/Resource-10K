PART I

Item 1:

Business

THE COMPANY

Realty Income
Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

,
is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate
investment trust, or REIT. Our primary business objective is to generate
dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level
of funds from operations, or FFO per share. The monthly distributions are
supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to
regional and national retail chains. We have in-house acquisition, leasing,
legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio management and capital
markets expertise. Over the past 38 years, Realty Income and its predecessors
have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate
rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 15- to 20-years).

In addition, we seek to
increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active
portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties. Our
portfolio management focus includes:

•

Contractual
rent increases on existing leases;

•

Rent
increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit;
and

•

Active
management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant properties
and selectively selling properties.

In acquiring additional
properties, we adhere to a focused strategy of primarily acquiring properties
that are:

•

Freestanding,
single-tenant, retail locations;

•

Leased
to regional and national retail chains; and

•

Leased
under long-term, net-lease agreements.

At December 31, 2006, we
owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,955 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.7%, or 1,929 properties occupied of the 1,955
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 103 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 16.7 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space per property of 8,600 square feet.

Of the 1,955 properties
in the portfolio, 1,948, or 99.6%, are single-tenant, retail properties and the
remaining seven are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At
December 31, 2006, 1,923, or 98.7%, of the 1,948 single-tenant properties were
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension
options) of approximately 12.9 years.

In addition, at December
31, 2006, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc.
(“Crest”), had invested $137.5 million in 60 properties, which are
classified as held for sale. Crest was created to buy and sell properties,
primarily to individual investors, many of whom are involved in tax-deferred
exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Tax Code”).

We typically acquire
retail store properties under long-term leases with retail chain store
operators. These transactions generally provide capital to owners of retail
real estate and retail chains for expansion or other corporate purposes. Our
acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in well-defined target
markets and generally focus on retail chains providing goods and services that
satisfy basic consumer needs.


Our net-lease agreements
generally:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses (taxes,
insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed
increases, or to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of
the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.

Realty Income commenced
operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25 public and
private real estate limited partnerships with and into the Company. Each of the
partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and
managing long-term, net-leased properties.

The eight senior
officers of Realty Income owned 1.3% of our outstanding common stock with a
market value of $37.4 million at February 13, 2007. The directors and
eight senior officers of Realty Income, as a group, owned 2.5% of our
outstanding common stock with a market value of $72.6 million at
February 13, 2007.

Realty Income’s common
stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol
“O.” Our central index key number is 726728 and cusip number is 756109-104.

Realty Income’s Class D
cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OprD” and its cusip number is 756109-609.

Realty Income’s Class E
cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OprE” and its cusip number is 756109-708.

Realty Income’s 8.25%
Monthly Income Senior Notes, due 2008 are listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OUI.”  The cusip number of these
notes is 756109-203.

In February 2007, we had
70 permanent employees as compared to February 2006 when we had 69 permanent
employees and four temporary employees.

We maintain an Internet
website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of
charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to those reports,
as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports
with the SEC. None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of
this report.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Acquisitions
during 2006

During 2006, Realty
Income and Crest invested $769.9 million, in aggregate, in 378 new properties
and properties under development. These 378 properties are located in 30 states
and are 100% leased with an initial average lease term of 17.1 years. As
described below, Realty Income acquired 322 properties and Crest acquired 56
properties.

Included in the $769.9
million is $656.7 million invested by Realty Income in 322 new properties and
properties under development, with an initial weighted average contractual
lease rate of 8.6%. These 322 properties are located in 30 states, are 100%
leased with an initial average lease term of 16.7 years and will contain over
3.3 million leasable square feet. The 322 new properties acquired by Realty
Income are net-leased to 16 different retail chains in the following 11
industries: automotive collision services, automotive tire services,
convenience store, drug store, general merchandise, health and fitness, home
improvement, motor vehicle dealership, private education, restaurant, and
theater. Also included in the $769.9 million is $113.2 million invested by
Crest in 56 new retail properties.


At December 31, 2006,
Realty Income had invested $15.9 million in four properties that were
leased and being developed by the tenant (with development costs funded by
Realty Income). Rent on these properties is scheduled to begin at various times
during 2007. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding commitments to pay
estimated unfunded development costs totaling approximately $16.4 million.

The initial weighted
average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net
operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the base rent or,
in the case of properties under development, the estimated base rent under the
lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs.
Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual
rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will
remain at the percentages listed above.

Acquisition
of $349 million of Buffets/Ryan’s Restaurants on November 1, 2006

The 2006 acquisition
amounts include Realty Income and Crest’s aggregate investment of
$349 million to acquire 144 Buffets/Ryan’s restaurant properties. The
properties are leased under 20-year, triple-net lease agreements. These
properties were acquired subsequent to a merger between Buffets, Inc. and Ryan’s
Restaurant Group.

Of the 144 restaurant
properties, 116 were acquired by Realty Income and 28 were acquired by Crest.
The restaurants have, on average, approximately 10,300 leasable square feet and
are situated on an average lot size of approximately 2.86 acres. The properties
are existing locations that, on average, have been operating for 11 years.

Investments
in Existing Properties

In 2006, we capitalized
costs of $964,000 on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of
$761,000 for re-leasing costs and $203,000 for building improvements.

Net
Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders was $99.4 million in 2006 versus
$89.7 million in 2005, an increase of $9.7 million. On a diluted per
common share basis, net income was $1.11 per share in 2006 and $1.12 per share
in 2005.

The calculation to determine net income available to
common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of
gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and
can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment
properties during 2006 was $3.0 million as compared to $6.6 million for
2005.

Funds
from Operations (FFO)

In 2006, our FFO
increased by $26.2 million, or 20.2%, to $155.8 million versus
$129.6 million in 2005. On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $1.73
in 2006 compared to $1.62 for 2005, an increase of $0.11, or 6.8%.

See our discussion of
FFO in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO.

Issuances
of Common Stock

In October and November
2006, we issued an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of common stock at a price
of $26.40 per share. The net proceeds of approximately $173.2 million were used
to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Buffets/Ryan’s properties and
for other general corporate purposes.

In September 2006, we
issued 4.715 million shares of common stock at a price of $24.32 per share. The
net proceeds of approximately $109 million from this offering were used to fund
new property acquisitions, repay borrowings under our credit facility and for
other general corporate purposes.


In March 2006, we issued
5.2 million shares of common stock at a price of $24.39 per share. The net
proceeds of approximately $120.5 million were used to fund new property
acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.

Issuance
of Preferred Stock

In December 2006, we
issued 8.8 million shares of 6-


/


% Monthly Income Class E
cumulative redeemable preferred stock, with a liquidation value of $25 per
share. The net proceeds of $214 million from this issuance were used to repay
borrowings under our credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. Beginning
December 7, 2011, the Class E preferred shares are redeemable at our option for
$25 per share. Dividends of $0.140625 per share are paid monthly in arrears on
the Class E preferred stock.

Credit
Ratings Upgrades

In February 2006, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of Baa2 and
our preferred stock rating of Baa3 and raised the outlook to “positive” from “stable.”

In December 2006,
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating
of BBB and our preferred stock rating of BBB- and raised the outlook to “positive”
from “stable.”

Redemption
of 2007 Notes

In September 2006, we
redeemed all of our outstanding $110 million, 7-


/


%, unsecured notes due
May 2007 (the “2007 Notes”). The 2007 Notes were redeemed at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $3.2
million and a make-whole payment of $1.6 million. We recorded a loss on
extinguishment of debt totaling $1.6 million related to the make-whole
payment associated with the 2007 Notes. For 2006, the make-whole payment
represented approximately $0.017 per share.

Issuance
of 10-Year Senior Unsecured Notes

In September 2006, we
issued $275 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior unsecured
notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”). The price to the investor for the 2016 Notes
was 99.74% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.985%. The net
proceeds of approximately $271.9 million from this offering were used to
redeem the 2007 Notes and for other general corporate purposes. Interest on the
2016 Notes is paid semiannually.

Crest Property
Sales

During 2006, Crest
sold 13 properties from its inventory for an aggregate of $22.4 million,
which resulted in a gain of $2.2 million. Crest’s gains are included in “income
from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Crest Property
Inventory

Crest’s property
inventory at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 totaled
$137.5 million and $45.7 million, respectively, and is included in “real
estate held for sale, net”, on our consolidated balance sheets.

Increases
in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We continue our 37-year
policy of paying distributions monthly to our common stockholders. Monthly
distributions per share were increased in April 2006 by $0.000625 to $0.116875,
in July 2006 by $0.000625 to $0.1175, in September 2006 by $0.00775 to
$0.12525, in October 2006 by $0.000625 to $0.125875 and in January 2007 by
$0.000625 to $0.1265. The increase in January 2007 was our 37th consecutive
quarterly increase and the 42nd increase in the amount of our dividend since
our listing on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in 1994. In 2006, we paid
the following monthly cash distributions per share: three in the amount of
$0.11625, three in the amount of $0.116875, two in the amount of $0.1175, one
in the amount of $0.12525 and three in the amount of $0.125875, totaling
$1.43725. In December 2006, January 2007 and February 2007, we declared distributions
of $0.1265 per share, which were paid on January 16, 2007 and February 15, 2007
and will be paid on March 15, 2007, respectively.


The monthly distribution
of $0.1265 per share represents a current annualized distribution of
$1.518 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately
5.2% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of
$29.09 on February 13, 2007. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying
monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current
level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern of increasing
distributions per share, or what the actual distribution yield will be in any
future period.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Distributions
are paid monthly to our common stockholders and Class D and Class E preferred
stockholders if, and when declared by our Board of Directors.

In
order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating
annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains) and we are
subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2006, our cash distributions
totaled $139.1 million, or approximately 113.3% of our estimated REIT
taxable income of $122.8 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income
reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. We intend to
continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet
this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income
taxes. Our 2006 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled
$129.7 million, representing 83.2% of our funds from operations available
to common stockholders of $155.8 million.

The
Class D preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of
7.375% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to
$1.84375 per annum per share). The Class E preferred stockholders receive
cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25 per share
liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per share).

Future distributions
will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among
other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from operations,
financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Tax Code, our debt service
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In
addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the
amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our
results of operations or financial condition, and which prohibit the payment of
distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay
when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on
borrowings under our credit facility.

Distributions of our
current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes,
generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the
extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or
that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced
tax rate. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified
dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15% (for taxable years beginning
after December 31, 2002). In general, dividends payable by REITs are not
eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends, except to the extent
the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable
corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest), to income that was
subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute
taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year) or,
as discussed above, dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain
dividends.” Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be
treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock.
Distributions above that basis, generally, will be taxable as a capital gain.
Approximately 9.9% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or
deemed to have been made in 2006, were classified as a return of capital for
federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict the portion of future
distributions that may be classified as a return of capital.


BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

Investment
Philosophy

We believe that owning
an actively managed, diversified portfolio of retail properties under
long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. Net leases
typically require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and
property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and
maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically responsible for future rent
increases based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed increases or,
to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’
gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties
under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property
expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other
types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for
growth in rental income.

Investment
Strategy

In identifying new
properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing capital to
retail chain owners and operators by acquiring, then leasing back, retail store
locations. We categorize retail tenants as: 1) venture market,
2) middle market, and 3) upper market. Venture companies typically
offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate
between five and 50 retail locations. Middle market retail chains typically
have 50 to 500 retail locations, operations in more than one geographic region,
have been successful through one or more economic cycles, and have a proven,
replicable concept. The upper market retail chains typically consist of
companies with 500 or more locations, operating nationally, in a proven, mature
retail concept. Upper market retail chains generally have strong operating
histories and access to several sources of capital.

Realty Income primarily
focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we
believe are attractive for investment because:

•

They
generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that
can adversely affect venture retailers;

•

They
typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing
options;

•

They
generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time
since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as their
businesses have matured;

•

Their
relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater
number of stores; and

•

Middle
market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of
locations are closed due to underperformance.

We also focus on, and
have selectively made investments in, properties of upper market retail chains.
We believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because:

•

They
typically are of a higher credit quality;

•

They
usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly recognized
brand names;

•

They
utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square feet;
and

•

They
are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction
sizes.

While our investment strategy
focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper market
retail chains, we also selectively seek investment opportunities with venture
market retail chains. Periodically, venture market opportunities arise where we
feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be
purchased at favorable prices. To meet our stringent investment standards,
however, venture retail companies must have a well-defined retailing concept
and strong financial prospects. These opportunities are examined on a case by
case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area.

Historically, our
investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component
because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more
stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31,
2006, approximately 80.9% of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with
a service component in their business. Furthermore, we believe these service-oriented
businesses would be


difficult to duplicate
over the Internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to
competition from Internet businesses.

Credit
Strategy

We
generally provide sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade retail
chains. We typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national
retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive
risk-adjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers. Since 1970, our
overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 98.6%,
and the occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 97.5%.

We believe the principal
financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other
debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations.
Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its
retail business, we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease
obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations. It has
been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail
locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization they are less
likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate
their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we
will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of
reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization,
we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the
property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real estate
leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’
individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are
weaker performers.

In order to qualify for
inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent
investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive
current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile. We have established
a three-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:

•

Industry,
company, market conditions and credit profile;

•

Location
profitability, if profitability data is available; and

•

Overall
real estate characteristics, including value and comparative rental rates.

The typical profile of
companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50
or more retail locations. Generally the properties:

•

Are
located in highly visible areas,

•

Have
easy access to major thoroughfares; and

•

Have
attractive demographics.

Acquisition
Strategy

We seek to invest in
industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national chains are
capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale,
advertising and the selection of prime retail locations. We execute our
acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national
retail chain store owners and operators, doing business in a variety of
industries, by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations. We undertake
thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries, tenants and
property locations for investment. Our research expertise is instrumental to
uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing
program adds value. In selecting real estate for potential investment, we
generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics:

•

Freestanding,
commercially-zoned property with a single tenant;

•

Properties
that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains;

•

Properties
that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business
of their tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;
and

•

Properties
that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of
long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential
for rent increases.

Portfolio
Management Strategy

The active management of
the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We
continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the
performance of the industries, tenants and


locations in which we
have invested. The portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward
optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality. Our executives review
industry research, tenant research, property due diligence and significant
portfolio management activities. This monitoring typically includes regular
review and analysis of:

•

The
performance of various retail industries; and

•

The
operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the
tenants.

We have an active
portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we
believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio, or extend our average
remaining lease term. At December 31, 2006, we classified real estate with a
carrying amount of $138 million as held for sale, which includes
$137.5 million in properties owned by Crest. Additionally, we anticipate
selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been
specifically identified from which we anticipate receiving between $10 million
and $35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest
these proceeds into new property acquisitions. However, we cannot guarantee
that we will sell properties during the next 12 months.

Universal
Shelf Registration

In April 2006, we filed
a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of
three years. In accordance with the SEC rules, the amount of securities to be
issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it
was filed. The securities covered by this registration statement include common
stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any combination of such securities.
Realty Income may periodically offer one or more of these securities in
amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are
offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds
of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus
supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. As such,
there is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be
issued under this new shelf registration before it expires in April 2009. The
common stock issued in September 2006, October 2006 and November 2006, the 2016
Notes issued in September 2006 and the Class E preferred stock issued in
December 2006 were issued pursuant to our universal shelf registration
statement.

Conservative
Capital Structure

We believe that our
stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we
seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest
and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February 13, 2007, our total outstanding
credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were $920 million or
approximately 21.9% of our total market capitalization of $4.21 billion.
We calculate our total market capitalization at February 13, 2007 as the sum
of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 101,000,536 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $29.09 per share, or $2.94
billion;

•

Aggregate
liquidation value of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

•

Aggregate
liquidation value of the Class E preferred stock of $220 million; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $920 million.

Historically, we have
met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock, preferred
stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe
that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of
common stock, however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that
our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to
be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue
common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit
facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have
access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

We have a $300 million
revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2008. Realty
Income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under
the credit facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to
as LIBOR, plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points, for
all-in drawn pricing of 80 basis points over LIBOR. At February 13, 2007, we
had borrowing capacity of $300 million available on our credit facility and no
outstanding balance.


The credit facility is
expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other
corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to
interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the borrowing
capacity of the credit facility by up to $100 million, to a total borrowing
capacity of $400 million. Any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to
approval by the lending banks of our credit facility.

We use our credit
facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. When
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level
(generally in the range of $100 million to $200 million) and capital is
available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings
with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include
the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible preferred stock,
debt securities or convertible debt securities. We cannot assure you, however,
that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions
prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt
securities upon acceptable terms.

We are currently
assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior unsecured
notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Group. Currently, Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+,
Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a
rating of BBB to our senior notes. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings
have “positive” outlooks and Fitch has a “stable” outlook.

We have also been
assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has
assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of
BBB- to our preferred stock. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings have “positive”
outlooks and Fitch has a “stable” outlook.

The credit ratings
assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of
operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing
evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that any such
rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in
its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

We have no mortgage debt
on any of our properties.

No
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

Realty Income and its
subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in “variable
interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading
activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments.

As we have no joint
ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatory redeemable preferred stock,
our financial position and results of operations are currently not affected by
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.

Competitive
Strategy

We believe that to
successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we must seek to
maintain the following competitive advantages:

•

Size and Type of Investment Properties:

We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000)
net-leased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in
today’s real estate environment. Due to the complexities of acquiring and
managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets, we believe these types
of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest
or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger income-producing
properties. We believe the less intensive day-to-day property management
required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management of a large
portfolio of smaller properties, is an effective investment strategy. The
tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and
services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and


expand,
they generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically
the single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers, our method
of purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease
arrangement, allows the retail chain to free up capital.

•

Investment in New Retail Industries:

Though we specialize in single-tenant
properties, we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of
retail industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail
industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find
attractive. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, retail
industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and
national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by
consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as
capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base.

•

Diversification:

Diversification of the portfolio by retail
industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of
providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore
further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December
31, 2006, our retail property portfolio consisted of 1,955 properties located
in 48 states, leased to 103 retail chains doing business in 29 industry
segments. Each of the 29 industry segments, represented in our property
portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 17.8% of our rental revenue
for the quarter ended December 31, 2006.

•

Management Specialization:

We believe that our management’s
specialization in single-tenant retail properties, operated under net-lease
agreements, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this
specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in
this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.

•

Technology:

We intend to stay at the forefront of
technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our
operations. We maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to
analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments. We
believe that technology and information-based systems will play an increasingly
important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of
capital to a variety of industries and tenants.

PROPERTIES

At December 31, 2006, we
owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,955 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.7%, or 1,929 properties occupied of the 1,955
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 103 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 16.7 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,600 square
feet.

In addition to our real
estate portfolio at December 31, 2006, our subsidiary, Crest had invested
$137.5 million in 60 properties located in 15 states. These properties are
classified as held for sale.

At December 31, 2006,
1,923, or 98.4%, of our 1,955 retail properties were leased under net-lease
agreements. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for
minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes,
insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically responsible for
future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed
increases or, to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of
the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.

Our net-leased retail
properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store
operators. Most buildings are single-story structures with adequate parking on
site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods. The properties tend to be on
major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts, adequate access and
proximity to a sufficient population base to constitute a suitable market or
trade area for the retailer’s business.

Description
of Leasing Structure

At December 31, 2006,
1,923 single tenant and certain other retail properties or 98.4% of our 1,955
properties were net leased. In most cases, the leases:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses
(taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed
increases, or to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of
the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. Where leases provide for rent
increases based on increases in the consumer price index, generally these
increases become part of the new permanent base rent. Where leases provide for
percentage rent, this additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants’
gross sales, for a given period (usually one year), exceed a specified level
and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross
sales in excess of that level.

Matters
Pertaining to Certain Properties and Tenants

Of the 26 properties
available for lease or sale at December 31, 2006, all are single-tenant
properties except one. At December 31, 2006, 16 of our properties under lease
were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current
with their rent and other obligations. During 2006, each of our tenants
accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.

Certain
Properties Under Development

Of the 322 properties
Realty Income acquired in 2006, all were occupied at December 31, 2006,
except for four properties that were leased and being developed. In the case of
development properties, we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain
where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the building and we fund
the costs of that development, or we fund a developer who constructs the
building. In either case, there is an executed lease with a retail tenant at
the time of the land purchase (with a fixed rent commencement date) and there
is a requirement to complete the construction in a timely basis and within a
specific budget, typically within eight months after we purchase the land. The
tenant or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to
the extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a
predetermined amount. We also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we
purchase the land, which generally requires the tenant to begin paying base
rent when the store opens for business. The base rent is calculated by
multiplying a predetermined capitalization rate by our total investment in the
property including the land cost for the property, construction costs and
capitalized interest. In 2006, Realty Income acquired 15 development properties.
Crest did not acquire any development property in 2006. Both Realty Income and
Crest will continue to pursue development opportunities under similar
arrangements in the future.

Item 1A:

Risk Factors

As used under this
caption “Risk Factors,” references to our capital stock include our common
stock and any class or series of our preferred stock and references to our
stockholders include holders of our common stock or any class or series of our
preferred stock, in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context
otherwise requires.

In order to grow w

e
need to continue to acquire investment properties which may be subject to
competitive pressures.

We face competition in
the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect competition from:

•

Businesses;

•

Individuals;

•

Fiduciary
accounts and plans; and

•

Other
entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some of these
competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This
competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.


Our
tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent may be affected by
competition within their industries from other operators.

The tenants leasing our
properties can face significant competition from other operators. This
competition may adversely impact:

•

That
portion, if any, of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s
revenues; and

•

The
tenants’ results of operations or financial condition.

As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown
environmental liabilities.

Investments in real
property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of
property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the
presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such
liability regardless of:

•

Our
knowledge of the contamination;

•

The
timing of the contamination;

•

The
cause of the contamination; or

•

The
party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There
may be environmental problems of which we are unaware associated with our
properties. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators
of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators
of oil change and tune-up facilities. These facilities, and some other of our
properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground
tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create
a potential for release of hazardous substances.

The presence of
hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell
that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although our
leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all
applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising
from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject
to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no
assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification
obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities
attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to
stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities
and other indebtedness.

In addition, several of
our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in
building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by the
Company in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance and
removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or
operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the
asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact
with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or
other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or
demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building
owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow
third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury
associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Compliance.

We
have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise
aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous
substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of
our present properties. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should
exist, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership
interest. In addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects
with all present federal, state and local laws relating to ACMs.

Insurance and Indemnity.

In June 2005,
we entered into a seven-year environmental insurance policy on our property
portfolio which replaced the previous five-year environmental insurance
policy.  The limits on our current policy are $10 million per
occurrence, and $50 million in the aggregate, subject to a $40,000 self
insurance retention, per occurrence, for properties with underground storage
tanks and a $100,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for all other
properties.  It is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to
address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we
could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable
cost, or at all.


Our tenants are generally
responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters
that occur on our properties. For properties that have underground storage
tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants
generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the
states where these properties are located.

If
we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends
we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market
price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt
securities.

Commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been
organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to
qualify as a “REIT” under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we
cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that
has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will
continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue
to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification
as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly
technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For
example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay
distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In
the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such
qualification.

If
we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualifications as a REIT, we may
be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to
qualify as a REIT. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

•

We would be
required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

We would not
be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed
to our stockholders;

•

We could be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification is lost;

•

We would no
longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

•

This
treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or
distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the
years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price
of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Even
if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a
100% tax. Our subsidiary Crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property.

Distributions requirements imposed by law limit our
flexibility.

To
maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are
required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by
excluding net capital gains each year. We also are subject to tax at regular
corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.


In
addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we
fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our
ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for
the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in
prior years.

We
intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the
distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to
federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing
between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable
income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could
require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements
that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a
REIT.

Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the
interest of holders of our common stock.

Our
future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional
capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity
securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The
interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of
shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to
stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause
us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and
other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board
of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting,
dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely
affect, the interests of holders of our common stock.

We are
subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.

We intend to incur
additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $300
million acquisition credit facility. At February 13, 2007, we had no borrowings
outstanding under our $300 million acquisition credit facility and a total of
$920 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured senior debt
securities. To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt
levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are
and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk
that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt.
We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our $300
million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time. We
also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it
comes due. In addition, our $300 million credit facility contains financial
covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our
common stock and preferred stock in the event of deterioration in our results
of operations or financial condition, and our $300 million credit facility
provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal of or interest on
borrowings there under when due (subject to any applicable grace period), we
and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends on our capital stock, including
our outstanding common and preferred stock. If this were to occur, it would
likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and
preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities.

Our indebtedness could
also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred
stock, including:

•

Increasing our
vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

Limiting our
ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•

Requiring the
use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment
of principal, and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to
use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general
corporate requirements;

•

Limiting our
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our
industry; and

•

Putting us at a
disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.

Our
business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on
our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our ability to make
distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our
indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our
ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business
will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make
distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness
or to fund our other liquidity needs.


The market value of our capital
stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.

The market value of our
capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change
from time to time, including:

•

Prevailing
interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market
value of our capital stock and our debt securities;

•

The market for
similar securities issued by REITs;

•

General economic
and financial market conditions;

•

The financial
condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;

•

Changes in
financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to
us, our competitors or our industry;

•

Changes in our
credit ratings; and

•

Actual or
anticipated variations in quarterly operating results.

As a result of these and
other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may
experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the market value of our
capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our
operating performance or prospects.

Real
estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a
negative impact on our revenue.

We
are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real
estate. In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties
may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service
payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock. Additional
real estate ownership risks include:

•

Adverse
changes in general or local economic conditions;

•

Changes in
supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

•

Changes in
interest rates and operating expenses;

•

Competition
for tenants;

•

Changes in
market rental rates;

•

Inability to
lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

•

Renewal of
leases at lower rental rates;

•

Inability to
collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;

•

Changes in
tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact
upon the value of real estate;

•

Uninsured
property liability;

•

Property
damage or casualty losses;

•

Unexpected
expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance
with applicable federal, state and local laws;

•

Acts of
terrorism and war; and

•

Acts of God
and other factors beyond the control of our management.

An
uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could
subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under
the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties,
tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from
liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due
to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the
negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants
are generally required, at the tenant’s expense, to obtain and keep in full
force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance
policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for
property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement
cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily
excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain general
liability coverage varying between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000 depending on the
tenant and the industry in which it operates.

In
addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above,
many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance
policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by


the
tenants as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have
obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial
deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our
properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided
by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a
loss. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding
the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of
a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy,
we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue
from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay
the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and
to make distributions to our stockholders.

Compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990
and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended
expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operation.

Our
properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance
requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but
generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with
disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of
access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the
U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to
whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA
provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs
associated with compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures
than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis
than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be
adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with
the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results
of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of
and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make
distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we are required to operate our
properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and
other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and
bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make
substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these
expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations or
financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our
debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our
stockholders.

Property taxes may increase without notice.

The
real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop
or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those
properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.

Matters pertaining to certain properties and tenants.

Twenty-six of our
properties were available for lease or sale at December 31, 2006, of which all but
one were single-tenant properties. As of February 13, 2007, transactions to
lease or sell four of the 26 properties available for lease at December 31,
2006 were underway or completed. At December 31, 2006, 16 of our properties
under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of
which were current with their rent and other obligations.

For 2006, our tenants in
the convenience store, restaurant and child care industries accounted for
approximately 16.1%, 11.9% and 10.3%, respectively, of our rental revenue. A
downturn in any of these industries, whether nationwide or limited to specific
sectors of the United States, could adversely affect tenants in these
industries, which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial
position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and
interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make
distributions on our common stock and preferred stock. Individually, each of
the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of
our rental revenue for 2006.

In addition, a
substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market retail chains
that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain
upper-market retail chains, and therefore they are more likely to be adversely
affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional or
national economy.


We depend on key personnel.

We
depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of
the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our
ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other
indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that
we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience
in the retail, net-lease industry.

Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may
affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we
operate and our results of operations.

Terrorist
attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment. There can be
no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the
United States or United States businesses. These attacks, or armed conflicts,
may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants.

Such
events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in
increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy.
They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or
abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our
operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and
on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on
our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other
indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

Selected Financial Data

(not

(1)

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges is calculated by
  dividing earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings consist of net
  income before interest expense, including the amortization of debt issuance
  costs and interest classified to discontinued operations. Fixed charges are
  comprised of interest costs (including capitalized interest), the
  amortization of debt issuance costs and interest classified to discontinued
  operations. In computing the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and
  preferred stock cash dividends, preferred stock cash dividends consist of
  dividends on our Class B preferred stock, Class C preferred stock and our
  outstanding Class D and Class E preferred stock. We redeemed our Class B
  preferred stock in June 2004 and our Class C preferred stock in July 2004. We
  issued 4,000,000 shares of our 7-3/8% Class D preferred stock in May
  2004, 1,100,000 shares of our 7-3/8% Class D preferred stock in October 2004,
  and 8,800,000 shares of our 6.75% Class E preferred stock in December 2006.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

GENERAL

Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend
Company

®

, is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an
equity real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our primary business objective is
to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and
predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO per share. The monthly
distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail
properties leased to regional and national retail chains. We have in-house
acquisition, leasing, legal, retail research, real estate research, portfolio
management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 38 years, Realty Income
and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail
properties that generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements
(primarily 15- to 20-years).

In addition, we seek to increase distributions to
stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio management and the
acquisition of additional properties. At December 31, 2006, we owned a
diversified portfolio:

•

Of 1,955 retail
properties;

•

With an
occupancy rate of 98.7%, or 1,929 properties occupied of the 1,955 properties
in the portfolio;

•

Leased to 103 different
retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries;

•

Located in 48
states;

•

With over 16.7
million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With an average
leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,600 square feet.

Of the 1,955 properties in the portfolio, 1,948, or
99.6%, are single-tenant, retail properties and the remaining seven are
multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At December 31, 2006, 1,923,
or 98.7%, of the 1,948 single-tenant properties were leased with a weighted
average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of approximately
12.9 years.

In addition, at December 31, 2006, our wholly-owned
taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest”), had invested
$137.5 million in 60 properties, which are classified as held for sale. Crest
was created to buy and sell properties, primarily to individual investors, many
of whom are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”).

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Reserves

Realty Income is organized to operate as an equity
REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in
the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of its net cash
flow generated from leases on its retail properties. We intend to retain an
appropriate amount of cash as working capital. At December 31, 2006, we had
cash and cash equivalents totaling $10.6 million.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand,
cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to
meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We intend, however, to use
additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our
credit facility.

$300 Million Acquisition Credit
Facility

We have a $300 million revolving, unsecured credit
facility that expires in October 2008. Realty Income’s current investment grade
credit ratings provide for financing under the credit facility at the London
Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 65 basis points
with a facility fee of 15 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 80
basis points over LIBOR. At February 13, 2007, we had borrowing capacity
of $300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding
balance.


The credit facility is expected to be used to acquire
additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional
borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right
to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up
to $100 million, to a total borrowing capacity of $400 million. Any increase in
the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks of our
credit facility.

Mortgage Debt

We have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

Universal Shelf Registration

In April 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement
with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years. In accordance with
the SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf
registration statement was not specified when it was filed. The securities
covered by this registration statement include common stock, preferred stock,
debt securities, or any combination of such securities. Realty Income may
periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on
terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of
any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered,
will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering
materials, at the time of any offering. As such, there is no specific limit to
the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under this new shelf
registration before it expires in April 2009.

The common stock issued in September 2006, October
2006 and November 2006, the 2016 Notes issued in September 2006 and the Class E
preferred stock issued in December 2006 were issued pursuant to our universal
shelf registration statement.

Issuances of Common Stock

In October and November 2006, we issued an aggregate
of 6.9 million shares of common stock at a price of $26.40 per share. The net
proceeds of approximately $173.2 million were used to fund a portion of the
purchase price of the Buffets/Ryan’s properties and for other general corporate
purposes.

In September 2006, we issued 4.715 million shares of
common stock at a price of $24.32 per share. The net proceeds of approximately
$109 million from this offering were used to fund new property
acquisitions, repay borrowings under our credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.

In March 2006, we issued 5.2 million shares of common
stock at a price of $24.39 per share. The net proceeds of approximately $120.5
million were used to fund new property acquisitions and for other general
corporate purposes.

Issuance of Preferred Stock

In December 2006, we issued 8.8 million shares of 6-


/


%
Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, with a liquidation value of $25
per share. The net proceeds of $214 million from this issuance were used
to repay borrowings under our credit facility and for other general corporate
purposes.

Redemption of 2007 Notes

In September 2006, we redeemed all of our outstanding
$110 million, 7-


/


%, unsecured notes due May 2007 (the “2007
Notes”). The 2007 Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $3.2 million and a
make-whole payment of $1.6 million. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of
debt totaling $1.6 million related to the make-whole payment associated with
the 2007 Notes. For 2006, the make-whole payment represented approximately
$0.017 per share.

Issuance of 10-Year Senior Unsecured
Notes

In September 2006, we issued $275 million in aggregate
principal amount of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”).
The price to the investor for the 2016 Notes was 99.74% of the principal amount
for an effective yield of 5.985%. The net proceeds of approximately
$271.9 million from this offering were used to redeem the 2007 Notes and
for other general corporate purposes. Interest on the 2016 Notes is paid
semiannually.


Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a
conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative
debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage
ratios. At February 13, 2007, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings
and outstanding notes were $920 million or approximately 21.9% of our
total market capitalization of $4.21 billion. We define our total market
capitalization at February 13, 2007 as the sum of:

•

Shares of our
common stock outstanding of 101,000,536 multiplied by the last reported sales
price of our common stock on the NYSE of $29.09 per share, or
$2.94 billion;

•

Aggregate
liquidation value of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

•

Aggregate
liquidation value of the Class E preferred stock of $220 million; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $920 million.

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs
through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured
notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that the majority of our future
securities issuances should be in the form of common stock; however, we may
issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time. We may
issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that
allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into
additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently
finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt
securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the
capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

Credit Agency Ratings

We are currently assigned investment grade corporate
credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group. Currently,
Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s has assigned a rating of
Baa2 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior
notes. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings have “positive” outlooks and
Fitch has a “stable” outlook.

We have also been assigned investment grade credit
ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has
assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard
& Poor’s has assigned a rating of BBB- to our preferred stock. Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s ratings have “positive” outlooks and Fitch has a “stable”
outlook.

The credit ratings assigned to us could change based
upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition.
These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and
we cannot assure you that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a
rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant.
Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt
securities, preferred stock or common stock.

Notes Outstanding

Senior note obligations consist of the following
(dollars in thousands), sorted by maturity date:


Interest on all of the senior note obligations is paid
semiannually, with the exception of the interest on the 8-


/


% senior notes issued in October 1998, which is paid monthly. All of these
notes contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of
any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed
60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our
secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation
on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to
be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total
unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We
have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were
issued.

The following is a summary of the key financial
covenants to our senior unsecured notes. The actual amounts are as of December
31, 2006.

All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed
interest rates. Our credit facility interest rate is variable.

The following table summarizes the maturity of each of
our obligations as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions):

Table of Obligations

(1) There was no outstanding
credit facility balance on December 31, 2006 or February 13, 2007.

(2) Interest on credit
facility and notes has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of
December 31, 2006 through their respective maturity dates.

(3) Other consists of $16.4
million of estimated unfunded costs on properties under development and
$806,000 of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs.

Our credit facility and note obligations are
unsecured. Accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these
obligations.

Preferred Stock Outstanding

In May and October 2004, we issued an aggregate of 5.1
million shares of 7-


/


% Class D cumulative redeemable
preferred stock. Beginning May 27, 2009, shares of Class D preferred stock are
redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid
dividends. Dividends on shares of Class D preferred stock are paid monthly
in arrears.

In December 2006, we issued 8.8 million shares of 6-


/


%
Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock. Beginning December 7, 2011,
shares of Class E preferred stock are redeemable at our option for $25 per
share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends on shares of Class E
preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears.


No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or
Unconsolidated Investment

Realty Income and its subsidiaries have no
unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in “variable interest entities”
or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities
involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments.

As we have no joint ventures, off-balance sheet
entities, or mandatory redeemable preferred stock, our financial position or
results of operations are currently not affected by Financial Accounting
Standard Board Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.

Acquisitions During 2006

During 2006, Realty Income and Crest invested $769.9
million, in aggregate, in 378 new properties and properties under development.
These 378 properties are located in 30 states and are 100% leased with an
initial average lease term of 17.1 years. As described below, Realty Income
acquired 322 properties and Crest acquired 56 properties.

Included in the $769.9 million is $656.7 million
invested by Realty Income in 322 new properties and properties under
development, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.6%.
These 322 properties are located in 30 states, are 100% leased with an initial
average lease term of 16.7 years and will contain over 3.3 million
leasable square feet. The 322 new properties acquired by Realty Income are
net-leased to 16 different retail chains in the following 11 industries:
automotive collision services, automotive tire services, convenience store,
drug store, general merchandise, health and fitness, home improvement, motor
vehicle dealership, private education, restaurant and theater. Also included in
the $769.9 million is $113.2 million invested by Crest in 56 new retail
properties.

At December 31, 2006, Realty Income had invested $15.9
million in four properties that were leased and under contract for development
by the tenant (with development costs funded by Realty Income). Rent on these
properties is scheduled to begin at various times during 2007. At December 31,
2006, we had outstanding commitments to pay estimated unfunded development
costs totaling $16.4 million.

The initial weighted average contractual lease rate is
computed as estimated contractual net operating income (in a net-leased
property this is equal to the base rent or, in the case of properties under
development, the estimated base rent under the lease) for the first year of
each lease, divided by the estimated total costs. Since it is possible that a
tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot assure you
that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages
listed above.

Acquisition of $349 million of
Buffets/Ryan’s Restaurants on November 1, 2006

The 2006 acquisition amounts include Realty Income and
Crest’s aggregate investment of $349 million to acquire 144 Buffets/Ryan’s
restaurant properties. The properties are leased under 20-year, triple-net
lease agreements. These properties were acquired subsequent to a merger between
Buffets, Inc. and Ryan’s Restaurant Group.

Of the 144 restaurant properties, 116 were acquired by
Realty Income and 28 were acquired by Crest. The restaurants have, on average,
approximately 10,300 leasable square feet and are situated on an average lot
size of approximately 2.86 acres. In general, the properties are existing
locations that, on average, have been operating for 11 years.

Investments in Existing Properties

In 2006, we capitalized costs of $964,000 on existing
properties in our portfolio, consisting of $761,000 for re-leasing costs and
$203,000 for building improvements.


Sales of Investment Properties

During 2006, we sold or exchanged 13 properties for
$10.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.0 million. This gain is
included in discontinued operations. The 13 properties sold or exchanged
consisted of one automotive parts store, one automotive service facility, one
child care facility, two convenience stores, and eight restaurants. The net
proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding
indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new properties.

Crest Property Sales

During 2006, Crest, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sold
13 properties from its inventory for an aggregate of $22.4 million, which
resulted in a gain of $2.2 million. Crest’s gains are included in “income
from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Crest Property Inventory

Crest’s property inventory at December 31, 2006 and
2005 totaled $137.5 million and $45.7 million, respectively, and is included in
“real estate held for sale, net”, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The financial statements of Crest are consolidated
into Realty Income’s financial statements. All material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Increases in Monthly Cash
Distributions to Common Stockholders

We continue our 37-year policy of paying distributions
monthly to our common stockholders. Monthly distributions per share were
increased in April 2006 by $0.000625 to $0.116875, in July 2006 by $0.000625 to
$0.1175, in September 2006 by $0.00775 to $0.12525, in October 2006 by
$0.000625 to $0.125875 and in January 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.1265. The
increase in January 2007 was our 37th consecutive quarterly increase and the
42nd increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in
1994. In 2006, we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share:
three in the amount of $0.11625, three in the amount of $0.116875, two in the
amount of $0.1175, one in the amount of $0.12525, and three in the amount of
$0.125875 totaling $1.43725. In December 2006, January 2007 and February 2007,
we declared distributions of $0.1265 per share, which were paid on January 16,
2007 and February 15, 2007 and will be paid on March 15, 2007,
respectively.

The monthly distribution of $0.1265 per share
represents a current annualized distribution of $1.518 per share, and an
annualized distribution yield of approximately 5.2% based on the last reported
sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $29.09 on February 13, 2007.
Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions, we
cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions, that
we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share, or what the
actual distribution yield will be in any future period.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our
consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates
and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects
our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and
assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other
factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However,
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.

In order to prepare our consolidated financial
statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by GAAP, many
subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting polices.
One of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining
depreciation expense for our properties. Depreciation of buildings and
improvements is generally computed using the straight–line method over an
estimated useful life


of 25 years. If we use a shorter or longer
estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of
operations. We believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life.
No depreciation has been recorded on Crest’s properties because they are held
for sale.

Another significant judgment must be made as to if,
and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a
change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. Generally, a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated
future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus
estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book
value. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the current book
value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If a property is held
for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value,
less cost to sell. The carrying value of our real estate is the largest
component of our consolidated balance sheet. If events should occur that
require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording
provisions for impairment losses, it could have a material impact on our
results of operations.

The following is a
comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004.

Rental Revenue

Rental revenue was $238.1 million for 2006 versus
$195.7 million for 2005, an increase of $42.4 million, or 21.7%. Rental
revenue was $172 million in 2004. The increase in rental revenue in 2006
compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to:

•

The 322 retail
properties acquired by Realty Income in 2006, which generated
$15.7 million of rent in 2006;

•

The 135 retail
properties acquired by Realty Income in 2005, which generated
$33.5 million of rent in 2006 compared to $12.1 million in 2005, an
increase of $21.4 million;

•

Same store rents
generated on 1,421 properties leased during the entire years of 2006 and 2005
increased by $1.3 million, or 0.7%, to $175.3 million from $174.0 million.

•

An increase in
straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of $155,000 in 2006
as compared to 2005; and

•

An increase of
$4.0 million relating to the aggregate of (i) development properties acquired
before 2005 that started paying rent in 2005, (ii) properties that were vacant
during part of 2006 or 2005 and (iii) lease termination settlements. These
items totaled $9.7 million in aggregate in 2006 compared to $5.7 million in
2005.

Of the 1,955 properties in the portfolio at December
31, 2006, 1,948, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining seven
are multi-tenant properties. Of the 1,948 single-tenant properties, 1,923, or
98.7%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding
rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately
12.9 years at December 31, 2006. Of our 1,923 leased single-tenant
properties, 1,713, or 89.1%, were under leases that provide for increases in
rents through:

•

Primarily base
rent increases tied to a consumer price index;

•

Fixed increases;

•

To a lesser
degree, overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales; or

•

A combination of
two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage rent, which is included in rental revenue,
was $1.1 million in 2006, $1.2 million in 2005 and $1.3 million in 2004.
Percentage rent in 2006 was less than 1% of rental revenue and we anticipate
percentage rent to be less than 1% of rental revenue in 2007.

Our portfolio of retail real estate, leased primarily
to regional and national chains under net leases, continues to perform well and
provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to
our stockholders. At December 31, 2006, our portfolio of 1,955 retail properties
was 98.7% leased with 26 properties available for lease, one of which is a
multi-tenant property.

As of February 13, 2007, transactions to lease or sell
four of the 26 properties available for lease at December 31, 2006 were
underway or completed. We anticipate these transactions will be completed
during the next several


months, although we cannot guarantee that all of these
properties can be leased or sold within this period. It has been our experience
that approximately 1% to 3% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any
given time; however, we cannot assure you that the number of properties
available for lease will not exceed these levels.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $10.4 million higher in 2006 than
in 2005. Interest expense increased in 2006 primarily due to higher average
outstanding balances, which was partially offset by slightly lower interest
rates related to our average outstanding borrowings. We issued $275 million of 10-year
notes in September 2006, $175 million of 12-year notes in September 2005 and
$100 million of 30-year bonds in March 2005, which contributed to the increase
in average outstanding balances and slightly lower average interest rates on
our debt.

The following is a summary of the components of our
interest expense (dollars in thousands):

Credit facilities and notes outstanding

At February 13, 2007, the weighted average interest
rate on our notes payable of $920 million was 5.99% and the average interest
rate on our credit line was 5.97%. There was no balance on our credit line at
February 13, 2007.

Interest Coverage Ratio

Our interest coverage ratio for 2006 was 4.1 times,
for 2005 was 4.4 times and for 2004 was 5.0 times. Interest coverage ratio is
calculated as: the interest coverage amount (as calculated in the following
table) divided by interest expense, including interest recorded to discontinued
operations. We consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate
supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense
obligations. Our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from
the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be
limited. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any
GAAP liquidity measures.


The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided
by operating activities to our interest coverage amount (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Crest activities.

(2)

The 2005 amount
includes intangibles recorded in connection with acquisitions of real estate
acquired for resale.

(3)

Includes interest
expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired
for resale by Crest.”

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2006 was 3.4
times, for 2005 was 3.6 times and for 2004 was 3.9 times. Fixed charge coverage
ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio,
except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator. We
consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure
of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend
payments. Our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different
from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may
be limited. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any
GAAP liquidity measures.

Interest coverage amount divided by interest expense
plus preferred stock dividends (dollars in thousands):

(1) Excludes the Class B
and Class C preferred stock non-cash charge of $3,774 in 2004 for excess of
redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed.

(2) Includes interest
expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired
for resale by Crest.”

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization was $59.5 million in
2006 versus $46.2 million in 2005 and $39.7 million in 2004. The increases
in depreciation and amortization in 2006 and 2005 were due to the acquisition
of properties in 2006, 2005 and 2004, which were partially offset by property
sales during these years.


General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by $2.1
million to $17.5 million in 2006 versus $15.4 million in 2005. General and
administrative expenses were $13.1 million in 2004. In 2006, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 7.3% as
compared to 7.9% in 2005 and 7.6% in 2004. General and administrative expenses
increased in total dollars primarily due to increases in payroll and employee
benefit costs.

As our property portfolio has grown and continues to
grow, we have increased, and anticipate that we will continue to gradually
increase the level of our staffing. We expect general and administrative
expenses to moderately increase due to costs attributable to payroll, staffing
costs and corporate governance.

In February 2007, we had 70 permanent employees as
compared to February 2006 when we had 69 permanent employees and four temporary
employees.

Property Expenses

Property expenses are broken down into costs
associated with non-net leased multi-tenant properties, unleased single-tenant
properties and general portfolio expenses. Expenses related to the multi-tenant
and unleased single-tenant properties include, but are not limited to, property
taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt
expense and legal fees. General portfolio costs include, but are not limited to,
insurance, legal, bad debt expense, property inspections and title search fees.
At December 31, 2006, 26 properties were available for lease, as compared to 25
at December 31, 2005 and 32 at December 31, 2004.

Property expenses were $3.3 million in 2006, $3.7
million in 2005 and $3.1 million in 2004. The $392,000 decrease in property
expenses in 2006 is primarily attributable to a decrease in costs associated
with bad debt expense, legal fees, and property taxes.

Income Taxes

Income taxes were $747,000 in 2006 as compared to
$813,000 in 2005 and $699,000 in 2004. These amounts are for city and state
income taxes paid by Realty Income.

In addition, Crest incurred state and federal income
taxes of $494,000 in 2006 as compared to $943,000 in 2005 and $3.5 million in
2004. The decrease in Crest’s 2006 income taxes over the 2005 and 2004 income
taxes are due to lower taxable income, primarily attributable to lower gain on
sales of real estate acquired for re-sale. These amounts are included in “income
from discontinued operations, from real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

In September 2006, we redeemed all of our outstanding
$110 million, 7-¾%, unsecured notes due May 2007. The 2007 Notes were redeemed
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest of $3.2 million and a make-whole payment of $1.6 million. We
recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $1.6 million related to the
make-whole payment associated with the 2007 Notes. For 2006, the make-whole
payment represented approximately $0.017 per share.

Discontinued Operations

Crest acquires properties with the intention of
reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the
properties. Consequently, we classify properties acquired by Crest as held for
sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them. The operation of
Crest’s properties is classified as “income from discontinued operations, real
estate acquired for resale by Crest.”


The following is a summary of Crest’s “income from
discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale” for the years 2006,
2005 and 2004 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Realty Income’s operations from one property listed as
held for sale at December 31, 2006, plus properties sold in 2006, 2005 and 2004
have been classified as discontinued operations. The following is a summary of
our discontinued operations from real estate held for investment for the years
2006, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

The following is a summary of our total discontinued
operations for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in thousands, except per
share data):

The above per share amounts have each been calculated
independently.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Acquired
for Resale by Crest

In 2006, Crest sold 13 properties for $22.4 million,
which resulted in a gain of $2.2 million. In 2005, Crest sold 12
properties for $23.5 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.3 million. In
2004, Crest sold 51 properties for $75 million, which resulted in a gain
of $10.3 million. Crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes
and are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired
for resale by Crest.”


At December 31, 2006, Crest had $137.5 million
invested in 60 properties, which are held for sale. Crest generally carries a
real estate inventory in excess of $20 million. Crest generates an
earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments it receives on the
properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties.
It is our belief that at this level of inventory, rental revenue will exceed
the ongoing operating expenses of Crest without any property sales.

Gain on Sales of Investment
Properties by Realty Income

In 2006, we sold or exchanged 13 investment properties
for $10.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.0 million, which is
included in discontinued operations. In 2005, we sold 23 investment properties
and sold a portion of the land from two properties for $23.4 million and
recognized a gain on sales of $6.6 million, which is included in discontinued
operations, except for $18,000 that is included in other revenue. In 2004, we
sold or exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from
four properties for a total of $35.4 million and recognized a gain of
$12.7 million, which is included in discontinued operations, except for
$185,000 that is included in other revenue.

We have an active portfolio management program that
incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale
proceeds will generate higher returns, enhance the credit quality of our real
estate portfolio or extend our average remaining lease term. At December 31,
2006, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $138 million as held
for sale on our balance sheet, which includes properties owned by Crest.
Additionally, we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio
that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we anticipate
receiving between $10 million and $35 million in proceeds during the next 12
months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions.
However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12
months.

Provisions for Impairment on Real
Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest

Provisions for impairment of $1.2 million were
recorded by Crest on three properties in 2006. No provisions for impairment
were recorded by Crest in 2005 and 2004. Crest’s properties are held for sale
and the provisions for impairment recorded in 2006 reduced the carrying costs
to the estimated fair-market value of those properties, net of estimated
selling costs.

Provisions for Impairment on Realty
Income Investment Properties

In 2006, a provision for impairment of $16,000 was
recorded on one property. In 2005, we recorded provisions for impairment
totaling $186,000 on four properties. In 2004, we recorded provisions for
impairment totaling $2.4 million on six properties. These provisions are
included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate held for
investment” except for $151,000 in 2005 and $716,000 in 2004 which are included
in “provisions for impairment.”

Preferred Stock Cash Dividends and
Redemption Charge

Preferred stock cash dividends totaled
$11.4 million in 2006 as compared to $9.4 million in 2005 and
$9.5 million in 2004.

When we redeemed our Class B preferred stock in June
2004 and our Class C preferred stock in July 2004, we incurred non-cash charges
of $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the excess of
redemption value over the carrying value. These non-cash charges represent the
Class B and Class C preferred stock original issuance costs that were
paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common
stockholders when the shares were redeemed. These non-cash charges equated to
$0.05 per common share in 2004.

Net Income Available to Common
Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $99.4
million in 2006, an increase of $9.7 million as compared to $89.7 million
in 2005. Net income available to common stockholders in 2004 was
$90.2 million.

The calculation to determine net income available to
common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of
gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and
can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.


During 2006, the gain recognized from the sales of
investment properties was $3.0 million as compared to $6.6 million during
2005 and $12.7 million in 2004. Crest’s gain recognized from the sale of
properties during 2006 was $2.2 million as compared to $3.3 million during 2005
and $10.3 million during 2004.

FUNDS
FROM OPERATIONS

AVAILABLE
TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (FFO)

FFO for 2006 increased by $26.2 million, or 20.2%, to
$155.8 million as compared to $129.6 million in 2005 and $118.2 million in
2004. The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common
stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measure) to FFO. Also presented is information
regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average
number of shares outstanding for the years ended December 31 (dollars in
thousands, except per share amounts):

We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition, as net
income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of
real estate assets, reduced by gains on sales of investment property and
extraordinary items.

We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental
measure of a REIT’s operating performance as it is based on a net income
analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes noncash items such as
depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets
requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which
implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.
Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions,
presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for
depreciation, could be less informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the
REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used
as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit
facility.

Presentation of this information is intended to assist
the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although
it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO the same way, so
comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO is not
necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund


cash needs and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as an indication of Realty Income’s performance. In
addition, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash
flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay
interest payments.

Other Non-cash Items and Capitalized
Expenditures

The following information includes non-cash items and
capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio. These items
are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common
stockholders to arrive at FFO. Analysts and investors often request this
supplemental information.

(1)

The settlements on
the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention
strategy that was used by the Company in 1997 and 1998, which correlated to
pending issuances of senior note securities. We have not employed this strategy
since 1998.

(2)

Amortization of
deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and
capitalized when our notes were issued in May 1997, October 1998, January 1999,
March 2003, November 2003, March 2005, September 2005 and September 2006. These
costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes. No costs associated
with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating
agencies have been included.

(3)

A negative amount
indicates that our straight-line rent was greater than our actual cash rent
collected. A positive amount indicates that our straight-line rent was less
than our actual cash rent collected.

(4)

Represents the Class
B and Class C preferred stock non-cash charges for the excess of redemption
value over the carrying value.

IMPACT
OF INFLATION

Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases
in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes, increases in
the consumer price index, and/or fixed increases. We expect that inflation will
cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During
times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the
leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation.

Approximately 98.4%, or 1,923, of the 1,955 properties
in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is
responsible for property costs and expenses. Net leases tend to reduce our
exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased
costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating
expenses exceed increases in revenue.

IMPACT
OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

Statement
No. 157 sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires
additional disclosures about fair-value measurements. Statement No. 157 becomes
effective for us at the beginning of 2008. The impact of adopting Statement
No. 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.


In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Interpretation No. 48
applies to all tax positions accounted for under Statement 109, including tax
positions acquired in a business combination. Interpretation 48 is effective
for us at the beginning of 2007. The impact of adopting Interpretation No. 48
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results
of operations.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a
result of our credit facility and long-term notes used to maintain liquidity
and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest
rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes
on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve
these objectives we issue long-term notes, primarily at fixed rates, and may
selectively enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate
lock agreements, interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest
rate risk on a related financial instrument. We were not a party to any derivative
financial instruments at December 31, 2006. We do not enter into any derivative
transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of
techniques. The following table presents by year of expected maturity, the
principal amounts, average interest rates and fair values as of December 31,
2006. This information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

Expected Maturity Data as of December
31, 2006

(1)

$100 million matures in
November 2008.

(2)

The credit facility
expires in October 2008. The credit facility balance as of December 31, 2006
and February 13, 2007 was zero.

(3)

$20 million matures in
January 2009.

(4)

$100 million matures in
March 2013, $150 million matures in November 2015, $275 million matures in
September 2016, $175 million matures in September 2017 and $100 million
matures in March 2035.

(5)

We base the fair value
of the fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 on the closing market price or
indicative price per each note.

The table incorporates only those exposures that exist
as of December 31, 2006; it does not consider those exposures or positions that
could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss,
with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that
arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest
rates.

All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed
interest rates. Our credit facility interest rate is variable. At December 31,
2006, our credit facility balance was zero; however, we intend to borrow funds
on our credit facility in the future. Based on a hypothetical credit facility
borrowing of $50 million, a 1% change in interest rates would change our
interest costs by $500,000 per year.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

,

that Realty Income
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Realty
Income Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Realty
Income Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Also, in our opinion, Realty Income
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries
as listed in the accompanying table of contents and our report dated February
20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

REALTY INCOME CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004

1.         Organization
and Operation

Realty Income Corporation (“Realty Income,” the “Company,”
“we” or “our”) is organized as a Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial
retail real estate and have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”).

At December 31, 2006, we owned 1,955 properties,
located in 48 states, containing over 16.7 million leasable square feet,
along with 60 properties owned by our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary,
Crest Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest”). Crest was created to buy and sell properties,
primarily to individual investors, many of whom are involved in tax-deferred
exchanges, under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Tax Code”).

A 2-for-1 stock split was declared in November 2004
and became effective after the market closed on December 31, 2004. Common
stockholders received an additional share of common stock for each share they
owned. The increase in the number of common shares outstanding and all per
common share data has been adjusted for the stock split.

Information with respect to number of properties,
square feet, average initial lease term and weighted average contractual lease
rate is unaudited.

2.         Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures

Federal Income Taxes

.
We have elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under
the Tax Code. We believe we have qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT.
Under the REIT operating structure, we are permitted to deduct distributions
paid to our stockholders and generally will not be required to pay federal
corporate income taxes on such income. Accordingly, no provision has been made
for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
except for federal income taxes of Crest, which totaled $396,000 in 2006,
$760,000 in 2005 and $2.8 million in 2004 and are included in “income from
discontinued operations, real estate acquired by Crest.”

Earnings and profits that determine the taxability of
distributions to stockholders differ from net income reported for financial
reporting purposes due to differences in the estimated useful lives and methods
used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis) on the investments
in properties for tax purposes, among other things.

The following reconciles our net income available to
common stockholders to taxable income for 2006 (dollars in thousands)
(unaudited):


Net
Income Per Common Share

. Basic net income per
common share is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net
income available to common stockholders for the period by the number of common
shares that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares
for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The following is a
reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share
computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share
computation, for the years ended December 31:

In 2006, 2005 and 2004,
no stock options were anti-dilutive. We had nonvested shares from share-based
compensation that were anti-dilutive of 235,035 in 2006 and 305,476 in 2005. No
nonvested shares were anti-dilutive in 2004.

Discontinued Operations

.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets (“SFAS 144”)

, Realty Income’s operations from one
investment property classified as held for sale at December 31, 2006, plus
investment properties sold in 2006, 2005 and 2004, are reported as discontinued
operations. Their respective results of operations have been reclassified to “income
from discontinued operations, real estate held for investment.”  We classify properties as held for sale in
accordance with SFAS 144. We do not depreciate properties that are
classified as held for sale.

Crest acquires properties
with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them for investment
and operating the properties. Consequently, we classify properties acquired by
Crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them. In
accordance with SFAS 144, the operations of Crest’s properties are classified
as “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by
Crest.”

No debt was assumed by
buyers of our investment properties or repaid as a result of our investment
property sales and we have elected not to allocate interest expense to
discontinued operations related to real estate held for investment.

We allocate interest
expense related to borrowings specifically attributable to Crest’s properties. The
interest expense amounts allocated to the Crest properties are included in “income
from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

The following is a
summary of Crest’s “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired
for resale” for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):


The following is a
summary of Realty Income’s “income from discontinued operations, from real
estate held for investment” for the years ended December 31 (dollars in
thousands):

The following is a
summary of our total income from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

The per share amounts for
“income from discontinued operations” above and the “income from continuing
operations” and “net income” reported on the consolidated statement of income
have each been calculated independently.

Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable

.
All leases are accounted for as operating leases. Under this method, lease
payments that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. Any rental revenue contingent upon a
tenant’s sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales
breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indexes
are recognized only after the changes in the indexes have occurred and are then
applied according to the lease agreements.

We recognize an
allowance for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivable for amounts
deemed uncollectible. We consider tenant specific issues such as financial
stability and ability to pay rent when determining collectibility of accounts
receivable and appropriate allowances to record. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was $705,000 and $577,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Principles
of Consolidation

. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest and their
wholly owned subsidiaries, after elimination of all material intercompany
balances and transactions. All of Realty Income’s and Crest’s subsidiaries are
wholly-owned.

Cash
Equivalents

. We consider all
short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and
have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents.

Gain
on Sales of Properties

. We recognize gains on
sales of properties in accordance with Statement No. 66,

Accounting
for Sales of Real Estate.

Depreciation
and Amortization

. Lands, buildings and
improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost. Major replacements and
betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives, while ordinary repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred.


Buildings and
improvements that are under redevelopment, or are being developed, are carried
at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets. Additionally, amounts
essential to the development of the property, such as pre-construction costs,
development costs, construction costs, interest costs and other costs incurred
during the period of development are capitalized. We cease capitalization when
the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant
improvements, but in any event no later than one year from the completion of
major construction activity.

Properties are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Buildings

  years

Building
  improvements

  to 15 years

Tenant
  improvements and lease commissions

The
  shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life

Provisions
for Impairment

. We review long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a provision
is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted
and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds
(undiscounted) are less than the current book value. Impairment loss is
measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the
lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell.

Realty Income recorded a
provision for impairment of $16,000 in 2006 on one retail investment property
in the restaurant industry. The provision for impairment is included in
discontinued operations.

Realty Income recorded
provisions for impairment of $186,000 in 2005 on four retail properties, of
which two have been sold. These properties were classified in the following
industries: one in child care and three in restaurant.

Realty Income recorded
provisions for impairment of $2.4 million in 2004 on six retail properties, of
which five have been sold. These properties were classified in the following
industries: one in automotive service, one in child care, two in consumer
electronics, one in convenience store and one in restaurant.

Provisions for
impairment recorded on investment properties by Realty Income are included on
our consolidated statements of income in “income from discontinued operations,
real estate held for investment”, except for $151,000 in 2005 and $716,000 in
2004 which are included in provisions for impairment.

Crest recorded
provisions for impairment of $1.2 million in 2006 on three retail properties,
which are held for resale at December 31, 2006. No provisions for impairment
were recorded by Crest in 2005 and 2004. Provisions for impairment recorded by
Crest are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale by Crest” on our consolidated statements of income.

Acquired In-place Leases

.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations (“SFAS 141”),

the
fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place operating leases is
allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and
improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of
the value of above-market and below-market leases, the value of in-place leases
and tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values.

The fair value of the
tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and
buildings/improvements) is determined by valuing the property as if it were
vacant, and the “as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land and
buildings/improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of
these assets. Our determinations are based on a real estate appraisal for each
property, generated by an independent appraisal firm, which consider estimates
of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market
conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases. In allocating the fair
value to identified intangibles for above-market or below-market leases, an
amount is recorded based on the present value of the difference between
(i) the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and
(ii) our estimate of fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place
lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease.


Capitalized above-market
lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining
terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are
amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the
respective leases and expected below market renewal option periods.

The aggregate value of other
acquired intangible assets consists of the value of in-place leases and tenant
relationships. These are measured by the excess of the purchase price paid for
a property, after adjusting for above or below market lease value, less the
estimated fair value of the property “as if vacant,” determined as set forth
above. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and
below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining
periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its
stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be
recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate.

Share-Based
Compensation

Effective January 1,
2002, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and starting January 1,
2002, expensed costs for all stock option awards granted, modified, or settled.
Stock option awards under the plan vest over periods ranging from one to five years.
For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, there is no
difference between the stock option-based compensation expense included in
reported net income and that expense determined under the fair value method for
all awards.

Effective January 1,
2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payments. Statement
No. 123R requires companies to recognize in the income statement the
grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation
issued to employees.

Goodwill

.
Goodwill is tested for impairment during the second quarter of each year as
well as when events or circumstances occur indicating that our goodwill might
be impaired. We did not record any new goodwill or impairment on our existing
goodwill during 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Other
Assets.

Other assets consist of
the following at December 31 (in thousands):

Use
of Estimates

. The consolidated
financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

.
Certain of the 2005 and 2004 balances have been reclassified to conform to the
2006 presentation.


3.         Retail Properties Acquired

We acquire land, buildings
and improvements that are used by retail operators.

A. During 2006, Realty
Income and Crest invested $769.9 million, in aggregate, in 378 new retail
properties and properties under development. These 378 properties are located
in 30 states, will contain over 3.8 million leasable square feet, and are
100% leased with an average initial lease term of 17.1 years. Of the
$769.9 million invested in 2006, $6.0 million was used to acquire one
property with an existing lease already in-place with a retail tenant. In
accordance with SFAS 141, Realty Income recorded $1.6 million as the value
of the in-place lease and $628,000 as the value of below-market rents. These
amounts are recorded to “other assets” and “other liabilities”, respectively,
on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the lives of the
respective lease.

In comparison, during
2005, Realty Income and Crest invested $486.6 million, in aggregate, in
156 new retail properties and properties under development. These 156 new
retail properties are located in 30 states, contain over 1.9 million leasable
square feet and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 15.8 years. Of
the $486.6 million invested in 2005, $95.1 million was used to acquire 34
properties with existing leases already in-place with existing retail tenants. In
accordance with SFAS 141, Realty Income recorded $10.1 million and Crest
recorded $1.8 million as the value of in-place leases and Realty Income
recorded $183,000 as the value of above-market rents. In addition, Realty
Income recorded $756,000 and Crest recorded $66,000 as the value of
below-market rents on these leases. These amounts were recorded to “other
assets” and “other liabilities”, respectively, on our consolidated balance
sheet and are amortized over the lives of the respective leases. The amounts
recorded by Crest are included in the calculation of gain on sales of real
estate when the properties were sold during 2006 and 2005.

B. During 2006, Realty
Income invested $656.7 million in 322 new retail properties and properties
under development, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of
8.6%. These 322 properties are located in 30 states, will contain over 3.3
million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an average initial lease
term of 16.7 years. The initial weighted average contractual lease rate is
computed by dividing the estimated aggregate base rent for the first year of
each lease by the estimated total cost of the properties.

In comparison, during
2005, Realty Income invested $430.7 million in 135 new retail properties and
properties under development, with an initial weighted average contractual
lease rate of 8.4%. These 135 properties are located in 28 states, contain over
1.7 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an average initial
lease term of 15.6 years.

C. During 2006, Crest
invested $113.2 million in 56 new retail properties and properties under
development. In comparison, during 2005, Crest invested $55.9 million in 21 new
retail properties and properties under development.

D. Crest’s property
inventory at December 31, 2006 consisted of 60 properties with a total
investment of $137.5 million and at December 31, 2005 consisted of 17
properties with a total investment of $45.7 million. These amounts are
included on our consolidated balance sheets in “real estate held for sale, net.”

4.         Credit Facility

We have a $300 million
revolving acquisition credit facility that expires in October 2008, unless
extended as provided for in the agreement. Under the terms of the credit
facility, which commenced in October 2005, the borrowing rate is LIBOR (London
Interbank Offered Rate) plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis
points, for all-in drawn pricing of 80 basis points over LIBOR, based on our current
credit ratings. The credit facility offers us other interest rate options as
well.

The average borrowing
rate on our credit facilities during 2006 was 5.7%, compared to 4.3% in 2005
and 2.4% in 2004 on our previous $250 million credit facility, which expired in
October 2005. The increase in the average borrowing rate is due to an increase
in LIBOR since the beginning of 2005. Our current credit facility is subject to
various leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations. The Company is and
has been in compliance with these covenants.

Our credit facility is
unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for
this obligation.


5.         Notes Payable

In September 2006, we
issued $275 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior unsecured
notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”). The price to the investor for the 2016 Notes
was 99.74% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.985%. Interest
on the 2016 Notes is paid semiannually. The net proceeds of approximately
$271.9 million from this offering were used for other general corporate
purposes and to redeem the outstanding $110 million 7-3/4% unsecured notes due
May 2007 (the “2007 Notes”), which were issued in May 1997.

In September 2006, we
redeemed all of our outstanding 2007 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $3.2 million and a
make-whole payment of $1.6 million. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of
debt totaling $1.6 million related to the make-whole payment associated with
the 2007 Notes. For 2006, the make-whole payment represented approximately
$0.017 per share.

In September 2005, we
issued $175 million in aggregate principal amount of 5-3/8% senior unsecured
notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). The price to the investor for the 2017 Notes
was 99.974% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.378%. The net
proceeds of approximately $173.2 million from this offering were used to repay
borrowings under our unsecured acquisition credit facility, to fund new
property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. Interest on the
2017 Notes is paid semiannually.

In March 2005, we issued
$100 million in aggregate principal amount of 5-7/8% senior unsecured bonds due
2035 (the “2035 Bonds”).  The price to the investor for the 2035 Bonds was
98.296% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.998%.  The net
proceeds of approximately $97 million from this offering were used to repay
borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.  Interest on the 2035 Bonds is paid semiannually.

In November 2003, we
issued $150 million of 5-1/2% senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the “2015 Notes”).
Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually.

In March 2003, we issued
$100 million of 5-3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”). Interest
on the 2013 Notes is payable semiannually.

In January 1999, we
issued $20 million of 8% senior unsecured notes due 2009 (the “2009 Notes”).
Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semiannually.

In October 1998, we
issued $100 million of 8-1/4% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2008 (the “2008
Notes”). In May 1998, we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement
associated with the 2008 Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we made a
payment of $8.7 million in 1998. The payment on the agreement is being
amortized over 10 years (the life of the 2008 Notes) as a yield adjustment to
interest expense. After taking into effect the results of a treasury interest
rate lock agreement, the effective rate to us on the 2008 Notes is 9.12%.
Interest on the 2008 Notes is payable monthly. The 2008 Notes are unsecured.

Interest incurred on the
2016 Notes, 2017 Notes, 2035 Bonds, 2015 Notes, 2013 Notes, 2009 Notes, 2008
Notes and 2007 Notes (redeemed in September 2006) collectively for each of the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $49.6 million,
$39.5 million and $32.0 million, respectively. In addition, when the 2007
Notes were redeemed, we paid a $1.6 million make-whole payment, which is
classified as “loss on extinguishment of debt” on our consolidated statements
of income. The interest rate on each of these notes is fixed.

Our outstanding notes
are unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for
these or any other obligations.


All of these notes
contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any debt
which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a
limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt
to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence
of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than
1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets
not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We have been in
compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were issued.

The following table
summarizes the maturity of our notes payable as of December 31, 2006 (dollars
in millions):

(1) There are no maturities in 2007, 2010 or
2011.

6.         Common Stock Offerings

A.        In October and November 2006, we issued
an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of common stock at a price of $26.40 per
share. The net proceeds of approximately $173.2 million were used to fund a
portion of the purchase price of the Buffets/Ryan’s properties and for other
general corporate purposes.

B.         In September 2006, we issued 4.715
million shares of common stock at a price of $24.32 per share. The net proceeds
of approximately $109 million from this offering were used to fund new property
acquisitions, repay borrowings under our credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.

C.         In March 2006, we issued 5.2 million
shares of common stock at a price of $24.39 per share. The net proceeds of
approximately $120.5 million were used to fund new property acquisitions and
for other general corporate purposes.

D.         In September 2005, we issued 4.1
million shares of common stock at a price of $23.79 per share. The net proceeds
of $92.7 million were used to fund new property acquisitions and for other
general corporate purposes.

E.         In March 2004, we issued 3.2 million
shares of common stock at a price of $22.375 per share. The net proceeds of
$67.9 million were used to repay a portion of our acquisition credit
facility borrowings, which had been used to acquire 112 convenience store
properties in March 2004.

7.         Preferred Stock Offerings and
Redemptions

A.        In December 2006, we issued 8.8 million
shares of 6-3/4% Monthly Income Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock,
with a liquidation value of $25 per share. The net proceeds of $214 million
from this issuance were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and
for other general corporate purposes. Beginning December 7, 2011, the Class E
preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25 per share. Dividends of
$0.140625 per share are paid monthly in arrears on the Class E preferred stock.

B.         In May 2004, we issued 4.0 million
shares of 7-3/8% Monthly Income Class D cumulative redeemable preferred
stock, with a liquidation value of $25 per share. The net proceeds of
$96.4 million from this issuance were used to redeem a portion of the
outstanding Class B and Class C preferred stock, repay borrowings outstanding
under our $250 million acquisition credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes. Beginning May 27, 2009, the Class D preferred shares
are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share. Dividends of $0.1536459 per
share are paid monthly in arrears on the Class D preferred stock.


In October 2004, we
issued an additional 1.1 million shares of Class D preferred stock for $25.4311
per share. The net proceeds of $27.4 million were used to repay borrowings
under our $250 million acquisition credit facility.

C.         When our Class B preferred stock was
redeemed in 2004, we incurred a non-cash charge of $2.4 million
representing the Class B preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid
in 1999.

D.         When our Class C preferred stock was
redeemed in 2004, we incurred a non-cash charge of $1.4 million
representing the Class C preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid
in 1999.

2.76 million shares of 9-3/8% Class B cumulative redeemable preferred stock, of
which 2,745,700 shares were outstanding for a portion of 2004. On June 6,
2004, all of the outstanding Class B preferred shares were redeemed. We
paid dividends to holders of our Class B preferred stock totaling

share to our Class C Preferred stockholders in 2004 of $1.37882 were
characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income.

9.         Operating Leases

A.        At December 31, 2006, we owned 1,955
properties in 48 states, excluding 60 properties owned by Crest. Of these 1,955
properties, 1,948, or 99.6%, are single-tenant, retail properties and the
remaining seven are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At
December 31, 2006, 26 properties were vacant and available for lease or sale.

Substantially all leases
are net leases where the tenant pays property taxes and assessments, maintains
the interior and exterior of the building and leased premises, and carries
insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire and extended
coverage.

Percentage rent for
2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.3 million,
respectively, including amounts recorded to discontinued operations.

At December 31, 2006,
minimum future annual rents to be received on the operating leases are as
follows (dollars in thousands):

B.         Major Tenants – No individual tenant’s
rental revenue, including percentage rents, represented more than 10% of our
total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004.

10.       Gain on Sales of Real Estate Acquired for
Resale by Crest

In 2006, Crest sold 13
properties for $22.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $2.2 million. In
2005, Crest sold 12 properties for $23.5 million, which resulted in a gain
of $3.3 million. As part of one sale in 2005, Crest provided buyer
financing in the form of a $1.3 million promissory note. This note was paid in
full in February 2006. In 2004, Crest sold 51 properties for $75 million,
which resulted in a gain of $10.3 million. Crest’s gains on sales are
reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations.


11.       Gain on Sales of Investment Properties by
Realty Income

In 2006, we sold or
exchanged 13 investment properties for $10.7 million, which resulted in a gain
of $3.0 million, which is included in discontinued operations.

In 2005, we sold 23
investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for
$23.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.6 million. This gain is
included in discontinued operations, except for $18,000 that is included in
other revenue.

In 2004, we sold or
exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four
properties for $35.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $12.7 million. Of
this gain, $12.5 million is included in discontinued operations and
$185,000 is included in other revenue. Included in the 43 properties was one
property leased by one of our tenants that we exchanged for another property
owned by that tenant (see note 13-H).

12.       Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We believe that the
carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2006 and 2005 reasonably approximate the fair values for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and all liabilities, due to their short-term
nature, except for the line of credit payable and notes payable. In making
these assessments, we used estimates. The fair value of the line of credit
payable approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those
available in the market place at the balance sheet date. The estimated fair
value of the notes payable at December 31, 2006 is $921.9 million and
at December 31, 2005 is $755.0 million, based upon the closing market
price per note or indicative price per each note at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

13.       Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow
Information

Interest paid in 2006
was $52.4 million, in 2005 was $36.4 million and in 2004 was $31.3 million.

Interest capitalized to
properties under development in 2006 was $2.2 million, in 2005 was $1.9 million
and in 2004 was $531,000.

Income taxes paid by
Realty Income and Crest in 2006 were $775,000, in 2005 were $1.4 million and in
2004 were $6.9 million.

The following non-cash
investing and financing activities are included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements:

A.

Stock
based compensation for 2006 was $3.0 million, for 2005 was $2.2 million and for
2004 was $1.4 million.

B.

In
2006, we exchanged one of our properties for a different property that was
leased to the same tenant. As part of this transaction, accumulated
depreciation was reduced by $67,000 and a gain of $67,000 was recorded. The
original cost of and the value received for property exchanged was $900,000. This
transaction had no impact to land or building and improvements.

C.

In
2006, we received shares of a public company as settlement of a bankruptcy
claim associated with a former tenant. We recorded a value of $207,000, which
is in other revenue, based on the closing market price of these shares on
December 31, 2006 and included them in other assets on our consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 2006. The shares were sold in January 2007.

D.

In
2005, Crest sold a property for $2.8 million and issued a mortgage note of
$1.3 million, which was paid in full in February 2006 and is included in
other assets on our December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet.

E.

In
2004, we recorded an impairment of $716,000 on one property to reduce its
carrying value to zero. This loss was the result of a dispute with the original
owner and tenant in their bankruptcy proceeding. Our title insurance company
failed to timely record the deed on this property upon our original
acquisition,


which
resulted in a claim by the bankruptcy trustee that Realty Income did not have
legal title to the property. In the second quarter of 2006, this issue was
resolved and we obtained title to the property. At that time we reinstated the
original carrying value adjusted for depreciation on our balance sheet and
recorded other revenue of $716,000. We also reversed accrued liabilities and
property expenses of $133,000 associated with this property. As part of the
settlement, these costs became the responsibility of the title insurance
company.

F.

In
June 2004, when our Class B preferred stock was redeemed, we incurred a non-cash
charge of $2.4 million for the excess of redemption value over the
carrying value.

G.

In
July 2004, when our Class C preferred stock was redeemed, we incurred a
non-cash charge of $1.4 million for the excess of redemption value over
the carrying value.

H.

In
2004, we exchanged one of our properties for a different property that was
leased to the same tenant. As part of this transaction, land was reduced by
$160,000, building was increased by $78,000, and accumulated depreciation was
decreased by $82,000.

I.

Accrued
costs on properties under development resulted in an increase in buildings and
accounts payable of $1.7 million in 2006. In 2005, non-cash additions to
properties resulted in an increase in buildings of $5.4 million and an increase
in accounts payable of $5.1 million.

J.

distributions (dollars in thousands):

14.       Employee Benefit Plan

We have a 401(k) plan
covering substantially all of our employees. Under our 401(k) plan, employees
may elect to make contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 60% of their
compensation, subject to limits under the IRS Code. We match 50% of our
employee’s contributions, up to 3% of the employee’s compensation. Our
aggregate matching contributions each year have been immaterial to our results
of operations.

15.       Common Stock Incentive Plan

In 2003, our Board of
Directors adopted and our stockholders approved the 2003 Incentive Award Plan
of Realty Income Corporation (the “Stock Plan”) to enable us
to attract and retain the services of directors, employees and
consultants, considered essential to our long-term success, by
offering them an opportunity to own stock in Realty Income and/or
rights that will reflect our growth, development and financial
success.  The Stock Plan was amended and restated by our Board of
Directors in February 2006. Under the terms of this plan, the aggregate number
of shares of our common stock subject to options, stock purchase rights
(SPR), stock appreciation rights (SAR) and other awards will be no
more than 3,428,000 shares. The maximum number of shares that may be
subject to options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation
rights and other awards granted under the plan to any individual in
any calendar year may not exceed 1,600,000 shares. This plan has a term of
10 years from the date it was adopted by our Board of Directors, which was March
12, 2003. To date, we have not issued any SPR or SAR.

The amount of share-based
compensation costs charged against income during 2006 were $3.0 million,
during 2005 were $2.2 million and during 2004 were $1.4 million.


Stock options were
granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock’s fair market
value at the date of grant. Stock options expire ten years from the date they
are granted and vest over service periods of one, three, four and five years. No
stock options were granted in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

The following table
summarizes our stock option activity for the years ended December 31:

At December 31, 2006,
the options outstanding and exercisable had exercise prices ranging from $10.63
to $14.70, with a weighted average price of $13.06, and expiration dates
ranging from June 2007 to December 2011 with a weighted average remaining term
of 2.6 years.

The total intrinsic
value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004 was $268,000, $377,000 and $480,000, respectively. The total intrinsic
value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
was $143,000, $67,000 and $101,000, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
of options outstanding was $1.6 million, $1.2 million and $2.2 million at
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
of options exercisable at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1.6 million,
$1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock
option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock at
December 31 of each year exceeds the price of the option. The market value of
the Company’s stock was $27.70, $21.62 and $25.29 at December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

The following table
summarizes our common stock grant activity under our Stock Plan for the years
2006, 2005 and 2004. The grants vest over periods ranging from immediately to
10 years.

(1)

Grant date fair value.


During 2006, we granted
210,332 shares of common stock under the Stock Plan. These shares vest over the
following service periods: 16,000 vested upon issuance, 4,000 vest over a
service period of one year, 4,000 vest over a service period of four years,
15,000 vest over a service period of five years and 171,332 vest over a service
period of 10 years.

As of December 31, 2006,
the remaining unamortized stock compensation expense totaled $15.6 million,
which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of
each applicable award. The amount of share-based compensation is based on the
fair value of the stock at the grant date. We define the grant date as the date
the recipient and the Company have a mutual understanding of the key terms and
condition of the award and the recipient of the grant begins to benefit from,
or be adversely affected by subsequent changes in the price of the shares.

The effect of pre-vesting
forfeitures on our recorded expense has historically been negligible. Any
future pre-vesting forfeitures are also expected to be negligible and we will
record the benefit related to such forfeitures as they occur. Under the terms
of the Stock Plan, we pay non-refundable dividends to the holders of our nonvested
shares. Under Statement No. 123R, the dividends paid to holders of these
nonvested shares should be charged as compensation expense to the extent that
they relate to nonvested shares that do not or are not expected to vest. Given
the negligible historical and prospective forfeiture rate determined by us, we
did not record any amount to compensation expense, related to dividends paid,
for 2006, nor do we expect to record any amounts in future periods.

16.       Segment Information

We evaluate performance
and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by industry basis. For
financial reporting purposes, we have grouped our tenants into 30 industry and
activity segments (including properties owned by Crest that are grouped
together). All of the properties are incorporated into one of the applicable
segments. Because almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating
expenses, revenue is the only component of segment profit and loss we measure.

The following tables set
forth certain information regarding the properties owned by us, classified
according to the business of the respective tenants as of December 31, 2006
(dollars in thousands):

(1) 
Crest’s revenues appear in “income from discontinued operations, real
estate acquired for resale by Crest” and is not included in this table.


17.       Commitments and Contingencies

In the ordinary course
of our business, we are party to various legal actions which we believe are
routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. We believe
that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

At December 31, 2006, we
have committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs of
$16.4 million on properties under development. In addition, we have
contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs of $806,000 as
well as a $6.0 million commitment to fund the construction costs of two
buildings, which are not currently under construction, and for which
construction is dependent upon the tenant’s commitment to build the buildings
prior to September 30, 2007.

Item 9:

Changes In and Disagreements
With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

We have had no
disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on
accountancy or financial disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two
most recent fiscal years.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c)) that are
designed to ensure that

information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.

As of and for the year
ended December 31, 2006, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
includes those policies and procedures that:

(1)
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(2)
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and

(3)
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting for the Company.

Management has used the
framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of
the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the
most recent fiscal year. KPMG LLP has issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Submitted on February 20,
2007 by,

Thomas A Lewis, Chief
Executive Officer and Vice Chairman

Paul M. Meurer, Chief
Financial Office, Executive Vice President and Treasurer


Changes in Internal Controls.

There have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no material
weaknesses, and therefore no corrective actions were taken.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and
compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from
human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be
circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such
limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial
reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process
safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
