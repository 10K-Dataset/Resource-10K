THE COMPANY

Realty
Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is a
Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment
trust, or REIT.  Our primary business objective is to generate
dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of
funds from operations, or FFO per share.  Our monthly distributions
are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to
regional and national retail chains.  We have in-house acquisition,
leasing, legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio management and
capital markets expertise. Over the past 38 years, Realty Income and its
predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that
generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 15 to 20
years).

In
addition, we seek to increase distributions to common stockholders and FFO per
share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional
properties. Our portfolio management focus includes:

·

Contractual
      rent increases on existing leases;

·

Rent
      increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions
      permit; and

·

The
      active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant
      properties and selectively selling
properties.

In
acquiring additional properties, we adhere to a focused strategy of primarily
acquiring properties that are:

·

Freestanding,
      single-tenant, retail locations;

·

Leased
      to regional and national retail chains;
and

·

Leased
      under long-term, net-lease
agreements.

At
December 31, 2007, we owned a diversified portfolio:

·

Of
      2,270 retail properties;

·

With
      an occupancy rate of 97.9%, or 2,222 properties occupied of the 2,270
      properties in the portfolio;

·

With
      only 48 properties available for
lease;

·

Leased
      to 115 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail
      industries;

·

Located
      in 49 states;

·

With
      over 18.5 million square feet of leasable space;
  and

·

With
      an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,150
      square feet.

Of the
2,270 properties in the portfolio, 2,259, or 99.5%, are single-tenant, retail
properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office
properties. At December 31, 2007, 2,212 of the 2,259 single-tenant properties
were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension
options) of approximately 13.0 years.

In
addition, at December 31, 2007, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest
Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest”), had invested $56.2 million in 30
properties, which are classified as held for sale.  Crest was created
to buy and sell properties, primarily to individual investors who are involved
in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”).

We
typically acquire retail store properties under long-term leases with retail
chain store operators. These transactions generally provide capital to owners of
retail real estate and retail chains for expansion or other corporate purposes.
Our acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in well-defined
target markets and generally focus on retail chains providing goods and services
that satisfy basic consumer needs.

-4-

Our
net-lease agreements generally:

·

Are
      for initial terms of 15 to 20
years;

·

Require
      the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses
      (taxes, insurance and maintenance);
and

·

Provide
      for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index,
      fixed increases, or to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a
      percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified
      level.

We
commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25
public and private real estate limited partnerships with and into us. Each of
the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring
and managing long-term, net-leased properties.

The
eight senior officers of Realty Income owned 1.3% of our outstanding common
stock with a market value of $33.2 million at February 1, 2008. The
directors and eight senior officers of Realty Income, as a group, owned 2.5% of
our outstanding common stock with a market value of $64.6 million at
February 1, 2008.

Our
common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker
symbol “O” with a cusip number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is
726728.

Our
Class D cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol “OprD” with a cusip number is 756109-609.

Our
Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol “OprE” with a cusip number is 756109-708.

Realty
Income’s 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2008 are listed on the NYSE under
the ticker symbol “OUI” with a cusip number of 756109-203.

In
February 2008, we had 75 permanent employees as compared to 70 permanent
employees in February 2007.

We
maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make
available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those
reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these
reports with the SEC.  None of the information on our website is
deemed to be part of this report.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Increases
in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We
continue our 38-year policy of paying distributions monthly.  Monthly
distributions per share were increased in April 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.127125,
in July 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.12775, in September 2007 by $0.00775 to $0.1355,
in October 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.136125 and in January 2008 by $0.000625 to
$0.13675.  The increase in January 2008 was our 41st consecutive
quarterly increase and the 47th increase in the amount of our dividend since our
listing on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in 1994. In 2007, we paid the
following monthly cash distributions per share: three in the amount of $0.1265,
three in the amount of $0.127125, two in the amount of $0.12775, one in the
amount of $0.1355 and three in the amount of $0.136125, totaling $1.56025. In
December 2007 and January 2008, we declared distributions of $0.13675 per share,
which were paid in January 2008 and will be paid in February 2008,
respectively.

The
monthly distribution of $0.13675 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of $1.641 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 6.5% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on
the NYSE of $25.15 on February 1, 2008. Although we expect to continue our
policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain our current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share, or what our actual distribution yield
will be in any future period.

Acquisitions
During 2007

During
2007, Realty Income and Crest invested $533.7 million, in aggregate, in 357 new
retail properties and properties under development. These 357 new properties are
located in 38 states, will contain over 1.9 million leasable square feet, and
are 100% leased with an average lease term of 19.3 years.  As
described below, Realty Income acquired 325 properties and Crest acquired 32
properties.

Included
in the $533.7 million is $503.8 million invested by Realty Income in 325 new
properties and properties under development, with an initial weighted average
contractual lease rate of 8.6%. These 325 properties are located in 38 states,
will contain over 1.8 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an
average lease term of 19.2 years.  The 325 new properties acquired by
Realty Income are net-leased to 16 different retail chains in the following nine
industries: automotive service, automotive tire service, convenience store,
distribution and office, drug store, grocery, health and fitness, restaurant,
and sporting goods.  Also included in the $533.7 million is $29.9
million invested by Crest in 32 new restaurant properties.

The
initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated
contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of properties under development, the estimated base
rent under the lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated
total costs. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

Investments
in Existing Properties

In
2007, we capitalized costs of $1.9 million on existing properties in our
portfolio, consisting of $614,000 for re-leasing costs and $1.3 million for
building improvements.

Issuance
of 12-Year Senior Unsecured Notes

In
September 2007, we issued $550 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75%
senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”).  The price to the
investor for the 2019 Notes was 99.827% of the principal amount for an effective
yield of 6.772%.  The net proceeds of approximately $544.4 million
from this offering were used to fund certain acquisitions, repay borrowings
under our acquisition credit facility and for general corporate
purposes.  The remaining net proceeds, which are included in “cash and
cash equivalents” on our 2007 consolidated balance sheet, will be used for
general corporate purposes, which include additional property
acquisitions.  Interest on the 2019 Notes is paid
semiannually.

Credit
Ratings Upgrade

In
April 2007, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating
to Baa1 from Baa2 and our preferred stock rating to Baa2 from Baa3, with a
stable outlook.

Standard
& Poor’s MidCap 400 Index

In
November 2007, we were added to the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) MidCap 400
Index.  The S&P MidCap 400 stock index covers companies with
market capitalizations in the range of $1.5 billion to $5.5 billion and is part
of a series of S&P indices.

Net
Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders was $116.2 million in 2007 versus
$99.4 million in 2006, an increase of $16.8 million. On a diluted per
common share basis, net income was $1.16 per share in 2007 as compared to $1.11
per share in 2006.

The
calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes
the gain from the sales of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to
period and can significantly impact net income available to common
stockholders.

The
gain recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2007 was $3.6
million, as compared to $3.0 million for 2006.

Funds
from Operations (FFO)

In
2007, our FFO increased by $33.9 million, or 21.8%, to $189.7 million
versus $155.8 million in 2006.  On a diluted per common share
basis, FFO was $1.89 in 2007 compared to $1.73 for 2006, an increase of $0.16,
or 9.2%.

See our
discussion of FFO in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which
includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to
FFO.

Crest’s
Property Sales

During
2007, Crest sold 62 properties from its inventory for an aggregate of
$123.6 million, which resulted in a gain of $12.3
million.  Crest’s gains are included in “income from discontinued
operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest” on our consolidated
statements of income.

Crest’s
Property Inventory

Crest’s
property inventory at December 31, 2007 totaled
$56.2 million.  These properties are included in “real estate
held for sale, net” on our consolidated balance sheets.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Distributions
are paid monthly to our common, Class D preferred and Class E preferred
stockholders if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.

In
order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating
annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains), and we are
subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2007, our cash distributions
totaled $182.2 million, or approximately 113.6% of our estimated REIT
taxable income of $160.4 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income
reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. We intend to
continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet
this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes.
Our 2007 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $157.7 million,
representing 83.1% of our funds from operations available to common stockholders
of $189.7 million.

The
Class D preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of
7.375% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to
$1.84375 per annum per share).  The Class E preferred stockholders
receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25 per
share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per
share).

Future
distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will
depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from
operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Tax Code, our debt
service requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that
could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a
deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition, and which
prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the
event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any
principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.

Distributions
of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax
purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to
the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend
or that such amounts constitute "qualified dividend income" subject to a reduced
tax rate. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified
dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15% (until it “sunsets” or
reverts to the provisions of prior law, which under current law will occur with
respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010). In general,
dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for

-7-

the
reduced tax rate on corporate dividends, except to the extent the REIT’s
dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such
as our taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest), to income that was subject to tax at the
corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we
retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year) or, as discussed above,
dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends.” Distributions
in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable
reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock. Distributions above that
basis, generally, will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold
their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 11.2% of the distributions to our
common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2007, were classified
as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict
the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of
capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

Investment
Philosophy

We
believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of retail
properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable
income.  Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for
minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes,
insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically responsible for
future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed
increases or, to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of
the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.  We believe that a
portfolio of properties under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant’s
responsibility for property expenses, generally produces a more predictable
income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing
to offer the potential for growth in rental income.

Investment
Strategy

In
identifying new properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing
capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring, then leasing back,
retail store locations. We categorize retail tenants as: 1) venture market,
2) middle market, and 3) upper market. Venture companies typically
offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate
between five and 50 retail locations. Middle market retail chains typically have
50 to 500 retail locations, operations in more than one geographic region, have
been successful through one or more economic cycles, and have a proven,
replicable concept. The upper market retail chains typically consist of
companies with 500 or more locations, operating nationally, in a proven, mature
retail concept. Upper market retail chains generally have strong operating
histories and access to several sources of capital.

Realty
Income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail
chains that we believe are attractive for investment because:

·

They
      generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles
      that can adversely affect venture
retailers;

·

They
      typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited
      financing options than upper market retail
  chains;

·

They
      generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time
      since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as
      their businesses have matured;

·

Their
      relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a
      greater number of stores; and

·

Middle
      market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number
      of locations are closed due to
underperformance.

We also
focus on, and have selectively made investments in, properties of upper market
retail chains. We believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for
investment because:

·

They
      typically are of a higher credit
quality;

·

They
      usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly
      recognized brand names;

·

They
      utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square
      feet; and

·

They
      are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction
      sizes.

-8-

While
our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to
middle and upper market retail chains, we also selectively seek investment
opportunities with venture market retail chains. Periodically, venture market
opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is
high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices. To meet our stringent
investment standards, however, venture retail companies must have a well-defined
retailing concept and strong financial prospects. These opportunities are
examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in making
investments in this area.

Historically,
our investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component
because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more
stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31,
2007, approximately 84.5% of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with
a service component in their business. Furthermore, we believe these
service-oriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the Internet
and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from
Internet businesses.

Credit
Strategy

We
generally provide sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade retail
chains.  We typically acquire and lease back properties to regional
and national retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an
attractive risk-adjusted return on the financing we provide to
retailers.  Since 1970, our overall weighted average occupancy rate at
the end of each year has been 98.5%, and the occupancy rate at the end of each
year has never been below 97.5%.

We
believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include
their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate
lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a
tenant conducts its retail business, we believe the risk of default on a
retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general
obligations. It has been our experience that since retailers must retain their
profitable retail locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization
they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this
would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we
believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the
event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during
reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or
sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real
estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the
retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations
that are weaker performers.

In
order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must
meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate
attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit
profile.  We have established a three-part analysis that examines each
potential investment based on:

·

Industry,
      company, market conditions and credit
profile;

·

Store
      profitability, if profitability data is available;
  and

·

Overall
      real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative
      rental rates.

The
typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition
are those with 50 or more retail locations.  Generally the
properties:

·

Are
      located in highly visible areas,

·

Have
      easy access to major thoroughfares;
and

·

Have
      attractive demographics.

Acquisition
Strategy

We seek
to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national
retail chains are capturing market share through service, quality control,
economies of scale, advertising and the selection of prime retail locations. We
execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional
and national retail chain store owners and operators, doing business in a
variety of industries, by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations. We
undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries,
tenants and property locations for investment. Our research expertise is
instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real
estate financing program adds value. In selecting real estate for potential
investment, we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following
characteristics:

·

Freestanding,
      commercially-zoned property with a single
  tenant;

·

Properties
      that are important retail locations for regional and national retail
      chains;

·

Properties
      that we deem to be profitable for the
retailers;

·

Properties
      that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the
      business of their tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major
      thoroughfares; and

·

Properties
      that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of
      long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the
      potential for rent increases.

Portfolio
Management Strategy

The
active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our
long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that
could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which
we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward
optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality. Our executives review
industry research, tenant research, property due diligence and significant
portfolio management activities. This monitoring typically includes regular
review and analysis of:

·

The
      performance of various retail industries;
and

·

The
      operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the
      tenants.

We have
an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when
we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio, or extend our average
remaining lease term. At December 31, 2007, we classified real estate owned by
Crest with a carrying amount of $56.2 million as held for sale on our
balance sheet.  Additionally, we anticipate selling investment
properties in our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from
which we anticipate receiving between $10 million and $35 million in proceeds
during the next 12 months.  We intend to invest these proceeds into
new property acquisitions. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell
properties during the next 12 months.

Universal
Shelf Registration

In
April 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is
effective for a term of three years.  In accordance with the SEC
rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration
statement was not specified when it was filed.  The securities covered
by this registration statement include common stock, preferred stock, debt
securities, or any combination of such securities.  We may
periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on
terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered.  The
specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any
securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or
other offering materials, at the time of any offering.  There is no
specific limit to the dollar amount of new securities that can be issued under
this new shelf registration before it expires in April 2009, and our common
stock, preferred stock and notes issued after April 2006 were all issued
pursuant to this universal shelf registration statement.

-10-

Conservative
Capital Structure

We
believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital
structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our
balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February
1, 2008, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes
were $1.47 billion, or approximately 33.7% of our total market
capitalization of $4.36 billion.

We
define our total market capitalization at February 1, 2008 as the sum
of:

·

Shares
      of our common stock outstanding of 101,286,217 multiplied by the last
      reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $25.15 per share
      on February 1, 2008, or $2.55
billion;

·

Aggregate
      liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class D preferred
      stock of $127.5 million;

·

Aggregate
      liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class E preferred
      stock of $220 million; and

·

Outstanding
      notes of $1.47 billion.

Historically,
we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock,
preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we
believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure,
however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to
time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a
level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested
into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to
permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt
securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the
capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

$300
Million Acquisition Credit Facility

We have
a $300 million revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October
2008. In April 2007, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our credit
ratings.  Effective May 2007, our  investment grade credit
ratings provided for financing under the credit facility at the London Interbank
Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 60 basis points with a
facility commitment fee of 15 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 75 basis
points over LIBOR.  At February 1, 2008, we had a borrowing capacity
of $300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding
balance.

We
expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and
for other corporate purposes.  Any additional borrowings will increase
our exposure to interest rate risk.  We have the right to request an
increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to $100 million,
to a total borrowing capacity of $400 million.  Any increase in the
borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks of our credit
facility.

We
regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend, renew or replace
our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate. We have the right to
extend the credit facility for an additional term of one year (to October
2009).

We use
our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions.
When outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level
(generally in the range of $100 million to $200 million) and capital is
available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings
with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the
issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, debt
securities or convertible debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that
we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions
prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt
securities upon acceptable terms.

-11-

Credit
Agency Ratings

We are
currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior
unsecured notes.  Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s
Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes.  The
rating by Standard & Poor’s has a “positive” outlook and the ratings by
Fitch and Moody’s have “stable” outlooks.

We have
also been assigned investment grade credit ratings on our preferred stock. Fitch
Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and
Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of BBB- to our preferred
stock.  The rating by Standard & Poor’s has a “positive” outlook
and the ratings by Fitch and Moody’s have “stable” outlooks.

The
credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our
results of operations and financial condition.  These ratings are
subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you
that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the
future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant.  Moreover, a rating
is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred
stock or common stock.

Mortgage
Debt

We have
no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

No
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have
no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in “variable interest
entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities
involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments.

As we
have no joint ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatory redeemable
preferred stock, our current financial position or results of operations are not
affected by Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.

Competitive
Strategy

We
believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we
must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:

·

Size and Type of Investment
      Properties:

We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000)
      net-leased retail properties represent an attractive investment
      opportunity in today’s real estate environment. Due to the complexities of
      acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets, we
      believe these types of properties have not experienced significant
      institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction
      experienced by larger income-producing properties. We believe the less
      intensive day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements,
      coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller
      properties, is an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our
      freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that
      satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally
      need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single
      largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers, our method of
      purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease
      arrangement, allows the retail chain to free up
  capital.

·

Investment in New Retail
      Industries:

Though we specialize in single-tenant
      properties, we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a
      variety of retail industries. We believe diversification will allow us to
      invest in retail industries that currently are growing and have
      characteristics we find attractive. These characteristics include, but are
      not limited to, retail industries that are dominated by local store
      operators where regional and national chain store operators can increase
      market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and
      streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major
      demographic shifts in a population
base.

-12-

·

Diversification:

Diversification
      of the portfolio by retail industry type, tenant, and geographic location
      is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for
      our stockholders, therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a
      continuing objective. At December 31, 2007, our retail property portfolio
      consisted of 2,270 properties located in 49 states, leased to 115 retail
      chains doing business in 30 industry segments. Each of the 30 industry
      segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted
      for no more than 24.2% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended
      December 31, 2007.

·

Management
      Specialization:

We believe that our management’s
      specialization in single-tenant retail properties, operated under
      net-lease agreements, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to
      maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train
      high-quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate
      ownership, finance and management.

·

Technology:

We
      intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to
      efficiently and economically carry out our operations. We maintain
      sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s
      performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that
      technology and information-based systems will play an increasingly
      important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source
      of capital to a variety of industries and
  tenants.

PROPERTIES

At
December 31, 2007, we owned a diversified portfolio:

·

Of
      2,270 retail properties;

·

With
      an occupancy rate of 97.9%, or 2,222 properties occupied of the 2,270
      properties in the portfolio;

·

With
      only 48 properties available for
lease;

·

Leased
      to 115 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail
      industries;

·

Located
      in 49 states;

·

With
      over 18.5 million square feet of leasable space;
  and

·

With
      an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,150
      square feet.

In
addition to our real estate portfolio, our subsidiary, Crest had invested
$56.2 million in 30 properties located in 14 states at December 31, 2007.
These properties are classified as held for sale.

At
December 31, 2007, 2,212, or 97.4%, of our 2,270 retail properties were leased
under net-lease agreements. Net leases typically require the tenant to be
responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including
property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically
responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price
index, fixed increases or, to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a
percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.

Our
net-leased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national
retail chain store operators. Most buildings are single-story structures with
adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods. The
properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic
counts, adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base to
constitute a suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s
business.

Description
of Leasing Structure

At
December 31, 2007, 2,212 single tenant and certain other retail properties, or
97.4%, of our 2,270 properties were net leased. In most cases, the
leases:

·

Are
      for initial terms of 15 to 20
years;

·

Require
      the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses
      (taxes, insurance and maintenance);
and

·

Provide
      for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index,
      fixed increases, or to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a
      percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. Where
      leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price
      index, generally these increases become part of the new permanent base
      rent. Where leases provide for percentage rent, this additional rent is
      typically payable only if the tenants’ gross sales, for a given period
      (usually one year), exceed a specified level and is then typically
      calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in excess of
      that level.

Matters
Pertaining to Certain Properties and Tenants

Of the
48 properties available for lease or sale at December 31, 2007, all are
single-tenant properties except one.  As of February 1, 2008,
transactions to lease or sell 17 of the 48 properties were underway or
completed.  At December 31, 2007, 25 of our properties under lease were
unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current
with their rent and other obligations.  During 2007, each of our
tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.

For
2007, our tenants in the convenience store and restaurant industries accounted
for approximately 14.0% and 21.2%, respectively, of our rental
revenue.  A downturn in any of these industries, whether nationwide or
limited to specific sectors of the United States, could adversely affect tenants
in these industries, which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our
financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal
of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make
distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.  Individually,
each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than
10% of our rental revenue for 2007.

In
addition, a substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market
retail chains that generally have more limited financial and other resources
than certain upper-market retail chains, and therefore they are more likely to
be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the
regional or national economy.  Some of our tenants have incurred
substantial debt and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by a
downturn in their respective businesses.

Realty Income owns
116 properties and Crest owns three properties, all leased to subsidiaries of
Buffets, Inc. (Buffets) and guaranteed by Buffets.  Buffets is a subsidiary
of Buffets Holding, Inc. (“Buffets Holdings”). On January 22, 2008, Buffets
Holdings, together with each of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  As of
February 12, 2008, Buffets’ lease payments to us are current.  Based on our
analysis of the Buffets’ locations owned by Realty Income, we believe that the
Chapter 11 filing will not have a material adverse affect on our operations or
financial position.

Certain
Properties Under Development

Of the
325 properties Realty Income acquired in 2007, four were development properties,
all of which were occupied at December 31, 2007.  In the case of
development properties, we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain
where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the building and we fund
the costs of that development, or we fund a developer who constructs the
building. In either case, there is an executed lease with a retail tenant at the
time of the land purchase (with a fixed rent commencement date) and there is a
requirement to complete the construction in a timely basis and within a specific
budget, typically within eight months after we purchase the land. The tenant or
developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent
that they exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined amount. We
also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land, which
generally requires the tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens for
business. The base rent is calculated by multiplying a predetermined
capitalization rate by our total investment in the property including the land
cost for the property, construction costs and capitalized
interest.  Crest did not acquire any development property in
2007.  Both Realty Income and Crest will continue to pursue
development opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.

Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date that this annual report was filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  We undertake no obligation to
publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking
statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this annual report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In
light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events discussed in
this annual report might not occur.

Item
1A:

Risk
Factors

As used
under this caption “Risk Factors,” references to our capital stock include our
common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock and references to
our stockholders include holders of our common stock or any class or series of
our preferred stock, in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the
context otherwise requires.

In
order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties which may be
subject to competitive pressures.

We face
competition in the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect
competition from:

·

Businesses;

·

Individuals;

·

Fiduciary
      accounts and plans; and

·

Other
      entities engaged in real estate investment and
  financing.

Some of
these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.
This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to
purchase.

Our
tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent may be affected by competition
within their industries from other operators.

The
tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other
operators.  This competition may adversely impact:

·

That
      portion, if any, of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s
      revenues; and

·

The
      tenants’ results of operations or financial
  condition.

Further,
the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we
receive from that tenant’s lease or leases.  In addition, a bankruptcy
court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us.  If
that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would
be subject to statutory limitations that might be substantially less than the
remaining rent we are owed under the leases.  In addition, any claim
we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full.

As
a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental
liabilities.

Investments
in real property can create a potential for environmental
liability.  An owner of property can face liability for environmental
contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on
the property. We can face such liability regardless of:

·

Our
      knowledge of the contamination;

·

The
      timing of the contamination;

·

The
      cause of the contamination; or

·

The
      party responsible for the contamination of the
  property.

There
may be environmental problems of which we are unaware associated with our
properties. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators
of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators
of oil change and tune-up facilities. These facilities, and some other of our
properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground
tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a
potential for release of hazardous substances.

-20-

The
presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability
to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although
our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all
applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising
from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject
to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no
assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification
obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities
attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to
stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and
other indebtedness.

In
addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos
was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may
be acquired by the Company in the future.  Environmental laws govern
the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs,
and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly
manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who
may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions,
including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed
during renovation or demolition of a building.  These laws may impose
fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with
these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or
operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos
fibers.

It is
also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold,
which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of
remediation of the problem.  When excessive moisture accumulates in
buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the
moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.
Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor
exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of
adverse health effects and symptoms,

including allergic or other
reactions. As a result, the presence of mold to which our tenants or their
employees could be exposed at any of our properties could require us to
undertake a costly remediation program

to contain or remove the
mold from the affected property, which would reduce our

cash
available for distribution. In addition, exposure to mold by our tenants or
others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns
arise.

Compliance.

We
have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise
aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous
substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of
our present properties. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should
exist, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership
interest.  In addition, we believe we are in compliance in all
material respects with all present federal, state and local laws relating to
ACMs.

Insurance and
Indemnity.

In June 2005, we entered into a seven-year
environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio which replaced the
previous five-year environmental insurance policy.  The limits on our
current policy are $10 million per occurrence, and $50 million in the
aggregate, subject to a $40,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for
properties with underground storage tanks and a $100,000 self insurance
retention, per occurrence, for all other properties.  It is possible that
our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental
situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for
environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all.

Our
tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for
environmental matters that occur on our properties.  For properties
that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in
our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the
state funds in the states where these properties are located.

-21-

If
we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends we
are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of
our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt
securities.

Commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been
organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to
qualify as a “REIT” under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we
cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that
has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will
continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue
to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification
as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly
technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial
and administrative interpretations, and the determination of various factual
matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For
example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each
year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to
stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (as
defined in the Code and determined without regard to the dividends paid
deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In the
future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such
qualification.

If we
fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualifications as a REIT, we may be
subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to
qualify as a REIT.  If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year:

·

We
      would be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable
      alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate
      rates;

·

We
      would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for
      amounts distributed to our
stockholders;

·

We
      could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
      following the year during which qualification is
  lost;

·

We
      would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders;
      and

·

This
      treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or
      distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for
      the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the
      market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt
      securities.

Even if
we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a
100% tax. Our subsidiary Crest is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property.

Distributions
requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.

To
maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are
required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by
excluding net capital gains each year. We also are subject to tax at regular
corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.

In
addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we
fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our
ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for
the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in
prior years.

-22-

We
intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the
distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to
federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing
between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable
income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could
require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution
requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with
qualifying as a REIT.

Future
issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our
common stock.

Our
future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional
capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity
securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The
interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of
shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to
stock incentive plans.  Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized
to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend,
voting and other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly,
the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with
voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise
adversely affect, the interests of holders of our common stock.

We
are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock
financing.

We
intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings
under our $300 million acquisition credit facility.  At
February 1, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $300 million
acquisition credit facility and a total of $1.47 billion aggregate principal
amount of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities. To the extent that new
indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now
face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated
with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient
to meet required payments on our debt.  We also face variable interest
rate risk as the interest rate on our $300 million credit facility is variable
and could therefore increase over time.  We also face the risk that we
may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. In addition, our
$300 million credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the
amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in
the event of deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition,
and our $300 million credit facility provides that, in the event of a failure to
pay principal of or interest on borrowings there under when due (subject to any
applicable grace period), we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends on
our capital stock, including our outstanding common and preferred stock. If this
were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market
price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the value of our debt
securities.

Our
indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our
common and preferred stock, including:

·

Increasing
      our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
      conditions;

·

Limiting
      our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital,
      capital expenditures and other general corporate
    requirements;

·

Requiring
      the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the
      payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing
      our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
      expenditures and general corporate
requirements;

·

Limiting
      our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
      and our industry; and

·

Putting
      us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less
      indebtedness.

Our
business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on
our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our
ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and
payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will
depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  We cannot
assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations
or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to
enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay
our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.

-23-

The
market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially
affected by various factors.

The
market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many
factors, which may change from time to time, including:

·

Prevailing
      interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the
      market value of our capital stock and our debt
  securities;

Real
estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a
negative impact on our revenue.

We are
subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real
estate.  In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our
properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt
service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock.
Additional real estate ownership risks include:

·

Adverse
      changes in general or local economic
conditions;

An
uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could
subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under
the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties,
tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from
liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due
to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the
negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants
are generally required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full
force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance
policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for
property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost
of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily
excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain general
liability coverage varying between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000 depending on the
tenant and the industry in which it operates.

-24-

In
addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above,
many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance
policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the
tenants as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have
obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial
deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our
properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided
by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a
loss. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding
the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a
loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we
could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from,
one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the
principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to
make distributions to our stockholders.

Compliance
with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other
regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely
impact our results of operation.

Our
properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for
"public accommodations" and "commercial facilities," but generally requires that
buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the
ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance
could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of
damages to private litigants. The retailers to whom we lease properties are
obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and we believe that these
retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. If
required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the
changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability
of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be
required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which
could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial
condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt
securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire
and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they
may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our
properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to
comply with those requirements and these expenditures could materially adversely
affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay
the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and
to make distributions to our stockholders.

Property
taxes may increase without notice.

The
real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop
or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those
properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.

We
depend on key personnel.

We
depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of
the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our
ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other
indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.  It is
possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with
equivalent experience in the retail, net-lease industry.

Terrorist
attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and
equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of
operations.

Terrorist
attacks may negatively affect our operations and your
investment.  There can be no assurance that there will not be further
terrorist attacks against the United States or United States businesses. These
attacks, or armed conflicts, may directly impact our physical facilities or the
businesses of our tenants.

Such
events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in
increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy.
They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or
abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our
operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and
on the value of our debt securities.  It could also have an adverse
effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or
other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

-25-

Recent
disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt
financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.

The
United States credit markets have recently experienced significant dislocations
and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt
financings to widen considerably.  These circumstances have materially
impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers
less attractive, and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of
certain types of debt financing.  Continued uncertainty in the credit
markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions.  A
prolonged downturn in the credit markets could cause us to seek alternative
sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust
our business plan accordingly.  In addition, these factors may make it
more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we
receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience
increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt
financing.  These events in the credit markets have also had an
adverse effect on other financial markets in the United States, which may make
it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our
common stock or preferred stock.  These disruptions in the financial
markets also may have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy
generally.

Ratio
      of Earnings to Fixed Charges is calculated by dividing earnings by fixed
      charges. For this purpose, earnings consist of net income before interest
      expense, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest
      classified to discontinued operations. Fixed charges are comprised of
      interest costs (including capitalized interest), the amortization of debt
      issuance costs and interest classified to discontinued
      operations.  In computing the ratio of earnings to combined
      fixed charges and preferred stock cash dividends, preferred stock cash
      dividends consist of dividends on our Class B preferred stock, Class C
      preferred stock and our outstanding Class D and Class E preferred
      stock.  We redeemed our Class B preferred stock in June 2004 and
      our Class C preferred stock in July 2004.  We issued 4,000,000
      shares of our 7.375% Class D preferred stock in May 2004, 1,100,000
      shares of our 7.375% Class D preferred stock in October 2004, and

Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of
Operations

GENERAL

Realty
Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is a
Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment
trust, or REIT.  Our primary business objective is to generate
dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of
funds from operations, or FFO per share.  The monthly distributions
are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to
regional and national retail chains.  We have in-house acquisition,
leasing, legal, retail research, real estate research, portfolio management and
capital markets expertise. Over the past 38 years, Realty Income and its
predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that
generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 15 to 20
years).

In
addition, we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share
through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional
properties. At December 31, 2007, we owned a diversified portfolio:

·

Of
      2,270 retail properties;

·

With
      an occupancy rate of 97.9%, or 2,222 properties occupied of the 2,270
      properties in the portfolio;

·

With
      only 48 properties available for
lease;

·

Leased
      to 115 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail
      industries;

·

Located
      in 49 states;

·

With
      over 18.5 million square feet of leasable space;
  and

·

With
      an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,150
      square feet.

Of the
2,270 properties in the portfolio, 2,259, or 99.5%, are single-tenant, retail
properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office
properties. At December 31, 2007, 2,212, or 97.9%, of the 2,259 single-tenant
properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding
extension options) of approximately 13.0 years.

In
addition, at December 31, 2007, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest
Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest”), had invested $56.2 million in 30 properties,
which are classified as held for sale.  Crest was created to buy and
sell properties, primarily to individual investors who are involved in
tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Tax Code”).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
Reserves

We are
organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and
distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a
substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our retail
properties. We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working
capital. At December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $193.1
million, which represents a portion of the proceeds from the September 2007
issuance of $550 million of 6.75% senior unsecured notes.

We
believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating
activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for
the foreseeable future.  We intend, however, to use additional sources
of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under
our credit facility.

-29-

$300
Million Acquisition Credit Facility

We have
a $300 million revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October
2008. In April 2007, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our credit
ratings.  Since May 2007, our investment grade credit ratings provided
for financing under the credit facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate,
commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 60 basis points with a facility fee of
15 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 75 basis points over
LIBOR.  At February 1, 2008, we had a borrowing capacity of
$300 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding
balance.

We
expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and
for other corporate purposes.  Any additional borrowings will increase
our exposure to interest rate risk.  We have the right to request an
increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility by up to $100 million,
to a total borrowing capacity of $400 million.  Any increase in the
borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks on our credit
facility.

We
regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend, renew or replace
our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate. We have the right to
extend the credit facility for an additional term of one year (to October
2009).

Mortgage
Debt

We have
no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

Universal
Shelf Registration

In
April 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is
effective for a term of three years. In accordance with the SEC rules, the
amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement
was not specified when it was filed. The securities covered by this registration
statement include common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any
combination of such securities.  We may periodically offer one or more
of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if
the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with
the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a
prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any
offering.  There is no specific limit to the dollar amount of new
securities that can be issued under this new shelf registration before it
expires in April 2009, and our common stock, preferred stock and notes issued
after April 2006 were all issued pursuant to this universal shelf registration
statement.

Conservative
Capital Structure

We
believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital
structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our
balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February
1, 2008, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes
were $1.47 billion or approximately 33.7% of our total market
capitalization of $4.36 billion.

We
define our total market capitalization at February 1, 2008 as the sum
of:

·

Shares
      of our common stock outstanding of 101,286,217 multiplied by the last
      reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $25.15 per share
      on February 1, 2008, or $2.55
billion;

·

Aggregate
      liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class D preferred
      stock of $127.5 million;

·

Aggregate
      liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class E preferred
      stock of $220 million; and

·

Outstanding
      notes of $1.47 billion.

Historically,
we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock,
preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we
believe that common stock may be the majority of our capital structure; however,
we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time. We
may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that
allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into
additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently
finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities.
However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at
terms that are acceptable to us.

Credit
Agency Ratings

We are
currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior
unsecured notes.  Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s
Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes.  The
rating by Standard & Poor’s has a “positive” outlook and the ratings by
Fitch and Moody’s have “stable” outlooks.

We have
also been assigned investment grade credit ratings on our preferred stock. Fitch
Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and
Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of BBB- to our preferred
stock.  The rating by Standard & Poor’s has a “positive” outlook
and the ratings by Fitch and Moody’s have “stable” outlooks.

The
credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our
results of operations and financial condition.  These ratings are
subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you
that any such rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the
future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant.  Moreover, a rating
is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred
stock or common stock.

Interest
on all of the senior note obligations is paid semiannually, with the exception
of the interest on the 8.25% senior notes issued in October 1998, which is paid
monthly.  All of these notes contain various covenants, including: (i)
a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total
adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any
secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio
to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause
our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the
maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our
outstanding unsecured debt. We have been in compliance with these covenants
since each of the notes were issued.

The
following is a summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured
notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes.  These
calculations, which are not based on GAAP measurements, are presented to
investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our

      ground lease. A majority of this rent is reimbursed to Realty Income as
      additional rent from our tenant.

(4)

Our
      tenants, who are generally sub-tenants under the ground leases, are
      responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases. In the event a
      tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily
      responsible.

(5)

Other
      consists of $7.9 million of commitments under construction contracts and
      $743,000 of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing
      costs.

Our
credit facility and note obligations are unsecured.  Accordingly, we
have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations.

We
anticipate paying off the notes due in 2008 and 2009 by one or more of the
following; using cash on hand, utilizing our credit facility or issuing new
securities.

Preferred
Stock Outstanding

In
2004, we issued 5.1 million shares of 7.375% Class D cumulative redeemable
preferred stock.  Beginning May 27, 2009, shares of Class D preferred
stock are redeemable at our option for $25 per share, plus any accrued and
unpaid dividends.  Dividends on shares of Class D preferred stock
are paid monthly in arrears.

In
December 2006, we issued 8.8 million shares of 6.75% Class E cumulative
redeemable preferred stock.  Beginning December 7, 2011, shares of
Class E preferred stock are redeemable at our option for $25 per share, plus any
accrued and unpaid dividends.  Dividends on shares of Class E
preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears.

No
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have
no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in “variable interest
entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities
involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments.

As we
have no joint ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatory redeemable
preferred stock, our financial position or results of operations are currently
not affected by Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.

Acquisitions
During 2007

During
2007, Realty Income and Crest invested $533.7 million, in aggregate, in 357 new
retail properties and properties under development. These 357 new properties are
located in 38 states, will contain over 1.9 million leasable square feet, and
are 100% leased with an average lease term of 19.3 years.  As
described below, Realty Income acquired 325 properties and Crest acquired 32
properties.

Included
in the $533.7 million is $503.8 million invested by Realty Income in 325 new
properties and properties under development, with an initial weighted average
contractual lease rate of 8.6%. These 325 properties are located in 38 states,
will contain over 1.8 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an
average lease term of 19.2 years.  The 325 new properties acquired by
Realty Income are net-leased to 16 different retail chains in the following nine
industries: automotive service, automotive tire service, convenience store,
distribution and office, drug store, grocery, health and fitness, restaurant and
sporting goods.  Also included in the $533.7 million is $29.9 million
invested by Crest in 32 new restaurant properties.

The
initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated
contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property that is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of properties under development, the estimated base
rent under the lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated
total costs. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

Increases
in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We
continue our 38-year policy of paying distributions monthly.  Monthly
distributions per share were increased in April 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.127125,
in July 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.12775, in September 2007 by $0.00775 to $0.1355,
in October 2007 by $0.000625 to $0.136125 and in January 2008 by $0.000625 to
$0.13675.  The increase in January 2008 was our 41st consecutive
quarterly increase and the 47th increase in the amount of our dividend since our
listing on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in 1994. In 2007, we paid the
following monthly cash distributions per share: three in the amount of $0.1265,
three in the amount of $0.127125, two in the amount of $0.12775, one in the
amount of $0.1355 and three in the amount of $0.136125, totaling $1.56025. In
December 2007 and January 2008, we declared distributions of $0.13675 per share,
which were paid in January 2008 and will be paid in February 2008,
respectively.

The
monthly distribution of $0.13675 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of $1.641 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 6.5% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on
the NYSE of $25.15 on February 1, 2008. Although we expect to continue our
policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain our current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share, or what our actual distribution yield
will be in any future period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting
Policies

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our consolidated financial
statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements
requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We
believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate
manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We
continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our
historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that
they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ
from these estimates and assumptions.

-33-

In
order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules
and guidelines set forth by GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with
regard to critical accounting policies. One of these judgments is our estimate
for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties.
Depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the
straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years. If we use a
shorter or longer estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our
results of operations. We believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of
useful life. No depreciation has been recorded on Crest’s properties because
they are held for sale.

Another
significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should
be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a
provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds
(undiscounted) are less than the current book value. Impairment losses are
measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the
lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less cost to sell. The carrying
value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance
sheet. If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of
our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses, it could have a
material impact on our results of operations.

The
following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Rental
Revenue

Rental
revenue was $290.2 million for 2007 versus $237.5 million for 2006, an increase
of $52.7 million, or 22.2%. Rental revenue was $195.1 million in 2005. The
increase in rental revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable
to:

·

The
      325 retail properties acquired by Realty Income in 2007, which generated
      $13.6 million of rent in 2007;

·

The
      322 retail properties acquired by Realty Income in 2006, which generated
      $53.4 million of rent in 2007 compared to $15.7 million in 2006, an
      increase of $37.7 million;

·

Same
      store rents generated on 1,505 properties during the entire years of 2007
      and 2006 increased by $2.9 million, or 1.4%, to $204.2 million from
      $201.3 million; net of

·

A decrease
      of $1.2 million relating to the aggregate of (i) development properties
      acquired before 2006 that started paying rent in 2006, (ii) properties
      that were vacant during part of 2007 or 2006 and (iii) lease termination
      settlements.  These items totaled $17.74 million in aggregate in
      2007 compared to $18.96 million in 2006;
and

·

A
      decrease in straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of
      $274,000 in 2007 as compared to
2006.

Of the
2,270 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2007, 2,259, or 99.5%, are
single-tenant properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant properties. Of
the 2,259 single-tenant properties, 2,212, or 97.9%, were net leased with a
weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the
option of the tenant) of approximately 13.0 years at December 31, 2007. Of
our 2,212 leased single-tenant properties, 1,999 or 90.4%, were under leases
that provide for increases in rents through:

·

Primarily
      base rent increases tied to a consumer price
  index;

·

Fixed
      increases;

·

To
      a lesser degree, overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross
      sales; or

·

A
      combination of two or more of the above rent
  provisions.

Percentage
rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $836,000 in 2007, $1.1 million in
2006 and $1.1 million in 2005. Percentage rent in 2007 was less than 1% of
rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1% of rental
revenue in 2008.

-34-

Our
portfolio of retail real estate, leased primarily to regional and national
chains under net leases, continues to perform well and provide dependable lease
revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our
stockholders.  At December 31, 2007, our portfolio of 2,270 retail
properties was 97.9% leased with 48 properties available for lease, one of which
is a multi-tenant property.

As of
February 1, 2008, transactions to lease or sell 17 of the 48 properties
available for lease at December 31, 2007 were underway or completed. We
anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months,
although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold
within this period. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 3% of
our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, we cannot
assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed
these levels.

Depreciation
and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization was $77.2 million in 2007 versus $59.3 million in 2006 and
$46.0 million in 2005. The increases in depreciation and amortization in
2007 and 2006 were due to the acquisition of properties in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
which were partially offset by property sales in these years.  As
discussed in the section entitled “Funds from Operations Available to Common
Stockholders,” depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is excluded
from our calculation of FFO.

Interest
Expense

Interest
expense was $13.0 million higher in 2007 than in 2006. Interest expense
increased in 2007 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances, which
were partially offset by slightly lower interest rates related to our average
outstanding borrowings, and Crest’s larger investment in real estate, which
contributed to the increase in interest expense included in discontinued
operations.  We issued $550 million of 12-year notes in

September
2007 and $275 million of 10-year notes in September 2006, which contributed to
the increase in average outstanding balances and slightly lower average interest
rates on our debt.

Interest
Coverage Ratio

Our
interest coverage ratio for 2007 was 4.1 times, for 2006 was 4.1 times and for
2005 was 4.4 times.  Interest coverage ratio is calculated as: the
interest coverage amount (as calculated in the following table) divided by
interest expense, including interest recorded to discontinued operations. We
consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a
company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations. Our calculation of
interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other
companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. This information should
not be considered as an alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures.

Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio

Our
fixed charge coverage ratio for 2007 was 3.1 times, for 2006 was 3.4 times and
for 2005 was 3.6 times. Fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the
same manner as interest coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends
are also added to the denominator. We consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be
an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest
and preferred stock dividend payments. Our calculation of the fixed charge
coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies
and, therefore, comparability may be limited. This information should not be
considered as an alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures or information

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses increased by $5.2 million to $22.7 million in 2007
versus $17.5 million in 2006.  General and administrative
expenses were $15.4 million in 2005.  In 2007, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 7.7% as compared
to 7.3% in 2006 and 7.9% in 2005.  General and administrative expenses
increased in 2007 primarily due to increases in employee and director
compensation costs. During 2007, we added two new directors to our board of
directors.  We anticipate that in 2008, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of total revenue will be flat or decrease.

In
February 2008, we had 75 permanent employees as compared to 70 permanent
employees in February 2007.  As our property portfolio has grown and
continues to grow, we have increased, and anticipate that we will continue to
gradually increase the level of our staffing.

Property
Expenses

Property
expenses are broken down into costs associated with non-net leased multi-tenant
properties, unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio expenses.
Expenses related to the multi-tenant and unleased single-tenant properties
include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance,
utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. General
portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, bad debt
expense, property inspections and title search fees. At December 31, 2007, 48
properties were available for lease, as compared to 26 at December 31, 2006 and
25 at December 31, 2005.

Property
expenses were $3.5 million in 2007, $3.3 million in 2006 and $3.9 million in
2005. Property expenses include provisions for impairment of $138,000 recorded
for one property in 2007 and $151,000 recorded for two properties in
2005.

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes were $1.4 million in 2007 as compared to $747,000 in 2006 and $813,000 in
2005.  These amounts are for city and state income taxes paid by
Realty Income.  The increase in 2007 is due primarily to an increase
in rental revenue resulting in higher city and state income tax expense and
higher state tax rates.

In
addition, Crest incurred state and federal income taxes of $3.0 million in 2007
as compared to $494,000 in 2006 and $943,000 in 2005.  The increase in
Crest’s 2007 income taxes over the 2006 and 2005 income taxes is due to higher
taxable income, primarily attributable to higher rental revenue and higher gain
on sales of real estate acquired for resale.  These amounts are
included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for
resale by Crest” on our consolidated statements of income.

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt

In
September 2006, we redeemed all of our outstanding $110 million, 7.75%,
unsecured notes due May 2007 (the “2007 Notes”).  The 2007 Notes were
redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2007
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $3.2 million, as well as a make-whole
payment of $1.6 million.  We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt
totaling $1.6 million related to the make-whole payment associated with the 2007
Notes.  For 2006, the make-whole payment represented approximately
$0.017 per share.

-37-

Discontinued
Operations

Crest
acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding
them as investments and operating the properties.  Consequently, we
classify properties acquired by Crest as held for sale at the date of
acquisition and do not depreciate them.  The operation of Crest’s
properties is classified as “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale by Crest” on our consolidated statements of
income.

Crest’s
Property Sales

In
2007, Crest sold 62 properties for $123.6 million, which resulted in a gain of
$12.3 million. For two property sales during 2007, Crest provided the
buyers partial financing for a total of $3.8 million, of which $619,000 was paid
in full in November 2007.  In 2006, Crest sold 13 properties for $22.4
million, which resulted in a gain of $2.2 million.  In 2005, Crest
sold 12 properties for $23.5 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.3
million.  In 2005, Crest provided a buyer partial financing of
$1.3 million for one property sale, which was paid in full in February
2006.  Crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are
included in discontinued operations.

December 31, 2007, Crest had $56.2 million invested in 30 properties, which are
held for sale. At December 31, 2006, Crest’s property inventory totaled
$137.5 million in 60 properties.  Crest generally carries real estate
inventory in excess of $20 million. Crest generates an earnings spread on
the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in
inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties.  It is
our belief that at this level of inventory, rental revenue will exceed the
ongoing operating expenses of Crest without any property sales.

Gain
on Sales of Investment Properties, Improvements and Land by Realty
Income

In
2007, we sold ten investment properties for $7.0 million, which resulted in a
gain of $1.7 million.  This gain is included in discontinued
operations.  In addition, we sold excess land and improvements from
five properties for an aggregate of $4.4 million, which resulted in a gain of
$1.8 million.  This gain from the land and improvements sales is
reported in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of income because
these improvements and excess land were associated with properties that continue
to be owned as part of our core operations.  In 2006, we sold or
exchanged 13 investment properties for $10.7 million, which resulted in a gain
of $3.0 million, which is included in discontinued
operations.  In 2005, we sold 23 investment properties and sold a
portion of the land from two properties for $23.4 million and recognized a
gain on sales of $6.6 million, which is included in discontinued operations,
except for $18,000 that is included in “other revenue” on our consolidated
statements of income.

We have
an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when
we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average
remaining lease term. At December 31, 2007, we classified real estate owned by
Crest with a carrying amount of $56.2 million as held for sale on our balance
sheet.  Additionally, we anticipate selling investment properties from
our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we
anticipate receiving between $10 million and $35 million in proceeds during the
next 12 months.  We intend to invest these proceeds into new property
acquisitions. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during
the next 12 months.

Provisions
for Impairment on Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest

In 2007
and 2005, no provisions for impairment were recorded by Crest.  In
2006, provisions for impairment of $1.2 million were recorded by Crest on three
properties.  One of the three properties was sold in
2007.  Crest’s properties are held for sale and the provisions for
impairment recorded in 2006 reduced the carrying costs to the estimated
fair-market value of those properties, net of estimated selling
costs.

Provisions
for Impairment on Realty Income Investment Properties

In
2007, we recorded a provision for impairment of $134,000 on one property, which
is included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate held for
investment” on our consolidated statement of income, as the property was
subsequently sold.  Additionally, we recorded a provision for
impairment of $138,000 on one property in 2007, which is included in property
expense on our consolidated statement of income.  In 2006, we recorded
a provision for impairment of $16,000 on one property.  In 2005, we
recorded provisions for impairment totaling $186,000 on four properties. The
2006 and 2005 provisions are included in “income from discontinued operations,
real estate held for investment” except for $151,000 in 2005, which is included
in property expense on our consolidated statement of income.

Preferred
Stock Dividends

Preferred
stock cash dividends totaled $24.3 million in 2007 as compared to
$11.4 million in 2006 and $9.4 million in 2005.

Net
Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders was $116.2 million in 2007, an increase
of $16.8 million as compared to $99.4 million in 2006. Net income available
to common stockholders in 2005 was $89.7 million.

The
calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes
gains from the sales of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to
period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net
income available to common stockholders.

During
2007, the gain recognized from the sales of investment properties was $3.6
million as compared to $3.0 million during 2006 and $6.6 million in
2005.  Crest’s gain recognized from the sale of properties during 2007
was $12.3 million as compared to $2.2 million during 2006 and $3.3 million
during 2005.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS
(FFO)

FFO for
2007 increased by $33.9 million, or 21.8%, to $189.7 million as compared to
$155.8 million in 2006 and $129.6 million in 2005. The following is a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe
is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO. Also presented is information
regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average
number of shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars
in thousands, except per share amounts):

We
define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trust’s definition, as net income available to common
stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, reduced
by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items.

-40-

We
consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating
performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio
performance that excludes noncash items such as depreciation. The historical
accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line
depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real
estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values
historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating
results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less
informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a
supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used as a measure of our
compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.

Presentation
of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating
performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs
calculate FFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be
meaningful. Furthermore, FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash flow
available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO should not be
considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity, of our ability to
make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments.

Other
Non-Cash Items and Capitalized Expenditures

The
following information includes non-cash items and capitalized expenditures on
existing properties in our portfolio. These items are not included in the
adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at FFO.
Analysts and investors often request this supplemental information.

The
      settlements on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate
      risk prevention strategy that we used in 1997 and 1998, which correlated
      to pending issuances of senior note securities.  We have not
      employed this strategy since 1998.

(2)

Amortization
      of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs
      incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in May 1997, October
      1998, January 1999, March 2003, November 2003, March 2005, September 2005,
      September 2006 and September 2007. These costs are being amortized over
      the lives of these notes. No costs associated with our credit facility
      agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been
      included.

(3)

A
      negative amount indicates that our straight-line rent was greater than our
      actual cash rent collected.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Tenant
leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases
in the tenants’ sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index, and/or
fixed increases. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to
result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than
increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up
with the rate of inflation.

Approximately
97.4%, or 2,212, of the 2,270 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants
under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses. Net
leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation.
Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if
increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in
revenue.

Item
7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk

We are
exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility
and long-term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate
investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objective
is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to
lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives we issue
long-term notes, primarily at fixed rates, and may selectively enter into
derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate lock agreements,
interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a
related financial instrument. We were not a party to any derivative financial
instruments at December 31, 2007. We do not enter into any derivative
transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

Our
interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The following
table presents by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average
interest rates and fair values as of December 31, 2007.  This
information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to
interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

We
      base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at December 31, 2007 on the
      closing market price or indicative price per each
  note.

The
table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2007. It
does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate
fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our
hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.

All of
our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates.  Our credit
facility interest rate is variable.  At December 31, 2007, our credit
facility balance was zero; however, we intend to borrow funds on our credit
facility in the future.  Based on a hypothetical credit facility
borrowing of $50 million, a 1% change in interest rates would change our
interest costs by $500,000 per year.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty
Income Corporation:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Realty Income
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as listed in the accompanying table
of contents. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement Schedule III as listed
in the accompanying table of contents. We also have audited Realty Income
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company’s management is responsible
for these consolidated financial statements, financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for their
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements, financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Realty Income Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Additionally, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Realty Income
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

1.           Organization
and Operation

Realty
Income Corporation (“Realty Income,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is organized
as a Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial retail real estate and have
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”).

At
December 31, 2007, we owned 2,270 properties, located in 49 states, containing
over 18.5 million leasable square feet, along with 30 properties owned by
our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest”). Crest
was created to buy and sell properties, primarily to individual investors who
are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”).

Information
with respect to number of properties, square feet, average initial lease term
and weighted average contractual lease rate is unaudited.

2.           Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures

Federal Income
Taxes

.  We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) under the Tax Code. We believe we have qualified and continue to
qualify as a REIT. Under the REIT operating structure, we are permitted to
deduct distributions paid to our stockholders and generally will not be required
to pay federal corporate income taxes on such income. Accordingly, no provision
has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, except for federal income taxes of Crest, which totaled
$2.5 million in 2007, $396,000 in 2006 and $760,000 in 2005 and are included in
discontinued operations.

Earnings
and profits that determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders
differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to
differences in the estimated useful lives and methods used to compute
depreciation and the carrying value (basis) on the investments in properties for
tax purposes, among other things.

The
following reconciles our net income available to common stockholders to taxable
income for 2007 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):

In June
2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation
No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.

.  Interpretation No. 48 applies to all tax positions
accounted for under Statement No. 109 and clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes by defining criteria that a tax position on an
individual matter must meet before that position is recognized in the financial
statements.  The adoption of Interpretation No. 48 in January 2007 did
not impact our financial position or results of operations and we do not have
any material unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities.

-50-

Absent
an election to the contrary, if a REIT acquires property that is or has been
owned by a C corporation in a transaction in which the tax basis of the property
in the hands of the REIT is determined by reference to the tax basis of the
property in the hands of the C Corporation, and the REIT recognizes gain on the
disposition of such property during the 10 year period beginning on the date on
which it acquired the property, then the REIT will be required to pay tax at the
highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of
the fair market value of the property over the REIT’s adjusted basis in the
property, in each case determined as of the date the REIT acquired the property.
 In August 2007, we acquired 100% of the stock of a C
corporation that owned real property. At the time of acquisition, the C
corporation became a Qualified REIT Subsidiary, was deemed to be
liquidated for Federal income tax purposes, and the real property was
deemed to be transferred to us with a carryover tax basis.  As of December
31, 2007, we have built-in gains of $59 million with respect to such
property.  We do not expect that we will be required to pay income tax
on the built-in gains in these properties during the ten-year period
ending August 28, 2017.  It is our intent, and we have the
ability, to defer any dispositions of these properties to periods
when the related gains would not be subject to the built-in gain
income tax or otherwise to defer the recognition of the built-in gain
related to these properties.  However, our plans could change and it
may be necessary to dispose of one or more of these properties in a taxable
transaction before August 28, 2017, in which case we would be required to pay
corporate level tax with respect to the built-in gains on these properties as
described above.

Net Income Per Common
Share

.  Basic net income per common share is computed by
dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per
common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders
for the period by the weighted average number of common shares that would have
been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The
following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per
common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common
share computation:

Discontinued
Operations

.  In accordance with FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(“SFAS 144”), Realty Income’s operations
from investment properties sold in 2007, 2006 and 2005 are reported as
discontinued operations.  Their respective results of operations have
been reclassified to “income from discontinued operations, real estate held for
investment” on our consolidated statements of income.  We do not
depreciate properties that are classified as held for sale.  No
investment properties were classified as held for sale at December 31,
2007.

Crest
acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding
them for investment and operating the properties.  Consequently, we
classify properties acquired by Crest as held for sale at the date of
acquisition and do not depreciate them.  In accordance with SFAS 144,
the operations of Crest’s properties are classified as “income from discontinued
operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest” on our consolidated
statements of income.

-51-

No debt
was assumed by buyers of our investment properties or repaid as a result of our
investment property sales and we do not allocate interest expense to
discontinued operations related to real estate held for investment. We allocate
interest expense related to borrowings specifically attributable to Crest’s
properties.  The interest expense amounts allocated to the Crest
properties are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale by Crest” on our consolidated statements of
income.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts
Receivable

.  All leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Under this method, lease payments that have fixed and determinable rent
increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any
rental revenue contingent upon a tenant’s sales is recognized only after the
tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in
the consumer price indexes are recognized only after the changes in the indexes
have occurred and are then applied according to the lease
agreements.

We
recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivable for
amounts deemed uncollectible.  We consider tenant specific issues such
as financial stability and ability to pay rent when determining collectibility
of accounts receivable and appropriate allowances to record.  The
allowance for doubtful accounts was $795,000 at December 31, 2007 and $705,000
at December 31, 2006.

Other
revenue includes non operating interest earned from investments in money market
funds and other notes of $3.6 million in 2007, $1.2 million in 2006 and $171,000
in 2005.

Principles of
Consolidation

.  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest and other entities for
which we make operating and financial decisions (control), after elimination of
all material intercompany balances and transactions.  All of Realty
Income’s and Crest’s subsidiaries are wholly-owned.  We have no
unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in variable interest
entities.

Cash
Equivalents

.  We consider all short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity
of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents.  Our cash equivalents are primarily investments in United
States Treasury or government money market funds.

Gain on Sales of
Properties

.  We recognize gains on sales of properties in
accordance with FASB Statement No 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate.

Depreciation and
Amortization

.  Land, buildings and improvements are recorded
and stated at cost.  Major replacements and betterments, which improve
or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives, while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred.  Buildings and improvements that are under redevelopment, or
are being developed, are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on
these assets.  Additionally, amounts essential to the development of
the property, such as pre-construction, development, construction, interest and
any other costs incurred during the period of development are
capitalized.  We cease capitalization when the property is available
for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in any
event no later than one year from the completion of major construction
activity.

Properties
are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets.  The estimated useful lives are as
follows:

Buildings                                                                                     25
years

Building

to 15 years

in-place operating
leases                                                
Remaining terms of the respective leases

Provisions for
Impairment

.  We review long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a provision is made for impairment
if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the
current book value. Impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the
current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If a
property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value, less estimated cost to sell.

-53-

In
2007, we recorded a provision for impairment of $134,000 on one retail
investment property in the motor vehicle industry.  This provision for
impairment is included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate held
for investment” on our consolidated statement of income (“Discontinued
Operations”).  In 2007, we also recorded a provision for impairment of
$138,000 on one retail investment property in the consumer electronics
industry.  This provision for impairment is included in property
expense on our consolidated statements of income.

In
2006, we recorded a provision for impairment of $16,000 on one retail investment
property in the restaurant industry.  In 2005, we recorded provisions
for impairment of $186,000 on four retail properties, of which two have been
sold.  These properties were classified in the following industries:
one in child care and three in restaurant.

The
provisions for impairment recorded on investment properties in 2006 and 2005 are
included in Discontinued Operations, except for $151,000 in 2005 which is
included in property expense on our consolidated statements of
income.

In
2006, Crest recorded provisions for impairment of $1.2 million on three retail
properties, which were held for resale at December 31, 2006. One of the three
properties was sold in 2007.  No provision for impairment was recorded
by Crest in 2007 or 2005.  Provisions for impairment recorded by Crest
are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for
resale by Crest” on our consolidated statements of income.

Acquired In-place
Leases

.  In accordance with FASB Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141”), the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place
operating leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of
land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and
liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases,
the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, based in each case on
their fair values.

The
fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land
and buildings/improvements) is determined by valuing the property as if it were
vacant, and the “as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land and
buildings/improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of
these assets.  Our determinations are based on a real estate appraisal
for each property, generated by an independent appraisal firm, and consider
estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market
conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.  In allocating
the fair value to identified intangibles for above-market or below-market
leases, an amount is recorded based on the present value of the difference
between (i) the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place
lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rate for the corresponding
in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the
lease.

Capitalized
above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the
remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values
are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the
respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.

The
aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consists of the value of
in-place leases and tenant relationships.  These are measured by the
excess of the purchase price paid for a property, after adjusting for above or
below-market lease value, less the estimated fair value of the property “as if
vacant,” determined as set forth above.  The value of in-place leases,
exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is
amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases. If a
lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized
amounts relating to that lease would be recorded to revenue or expense as
appropriate.

Share-Based
Compensation

Effective
January 1, 2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payments

.  Statement No. 123R requires companies to
recognize in the income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and
other equity-based compensation issued to employees.  Effective
January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB
Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and starting January 1, 2002 expensed costs for all stock
option awards granted, modified, or settled.

-54-

Goodwill

.  Goodwill
is tested for impairment during the second quarter of each year as well as when
events or circumstances occur indicating that our goodwill might be
impaired.  We did not record any new goodwill or impairment on our
existing goodwill during 2007, 2006 or 2005.

that are both imposed on and concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction
between us and our tenants.  We report the collection of these taxes
on a net basis (excluded from revenues).  The amounts of these taxes
are not significant to our financial position or results of
operations.

Use of
Estimates

.  The consolidated financial statements were prepared
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Impact of Recent Accounting
Pronouncements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement
No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements.

Statement No. 157 sets out a framework for
measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair-value
measurements. Statement No. 157 becomes effective for us at the beginning of
2008.  The impact of adopting Statement No. 157 is not expected
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities—

including an Amendment of FASB
S

tatement
No. 115.

Statement No. 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We
have elected not to use the fair value measurement provisions of Statement No.
159.

-55-

In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R (revised 2007),

Business
Combinations

.  Statement No. 141R will change the accounting
for business combinations.  Under Statement No. 141R, an acquiring
entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions.  Statement No. 141R will change the accounting treatment
and disclosures for certain specific items in a business
combination.  Statement No. 141R becomes effective for us at the
beginning of 2009.  We are still evaluating the impact of Statement
No. 141R on our financial position or results of operations.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interest in
Consolidated Financial Statements

.  Statement No. 160 clarifies that
a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated
financial statements.  This statement also requires consolidated net income
to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the
parent and the noncontrolling interest and requires disclosure, on the face of
the consolidated statement of income, of the amounts of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest.  In
addition, this statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes
in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in
deconsolidation and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net
income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.  Statement No. 160 becomes
effective for us at the beginning of 2009.  This statement will be applied
prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which
will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented.  We currently do
not have any minority or noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and we do not
expect Statement No. 160 to have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements; however, transactions between now and the adoption date of Statement
No. 160 could have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Reclassifications

.  Certain
of the 2006 and 2005 balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2007
presentation.

3.           Retail
Properties Acquired

We
acquire land, buildings and improvements that are used by retail
operators.

A.  During
2007, Realty Income and Crest invested $533.7 million, in aggregate, in 357 new
retail properties and properties under development. These 357 properties are
located in 38 states, will contain over 1.9 million leasable square feet,
and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 19.3 years.

In
comparison, during 2006, Realty Income and Crest invested $769.9 million,
in aggregate, in 378 new retail properties and properties under development.
These 378 retail properties are located in 30 states, contain over 3.8 million
leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 17.1
years.

B.  Of
the $533.7 million invested during 2007, Realty Income invested $503.8 million
in 325 new retail properties and properties under development with an initial
weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.6%. These 325 properties are
located in 38 states, will contain over 1.8 million leasable square feet, and
are 100% leased with an average lease term of 19.2 years.  The initial
weighted average contractual lease rate is computed by dividing the estimated
aggregate base rent for the first year of each lease by the estimated total cost
of the properties.

In
comparison, during 2006, Realty Income invested $656.7 million in 322 new retail
properties and properties under development, with an initial weighted average
contractual lease rate of 8.6%. These 322 properties are located in 30 states,
contain over 3.3 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an
average lease term of 16.7 years.

C.  During
2007, Crest invested $29.9 million in 32 new retail properties.  In
comparison, during 2006, Crest invested $113.2 million in 56 retail
properties.

D.  Crest’s
property inventory at December 31, 2007 consisted of 30 properties with a total
investment of $56.2 million and at December 31, 2006 consisted of 60
properties with a total investment of $137.5 million.  These
amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheets in “real estate held for
sale, net.”

-56-

E.  Of
the $533.7 million invested in 2007, $14.7 million was used to acquire
five properties with existing leases already in-place with retail
tenants.  In accordance with SFAS 141, Realty Income recorded $1.8
million as the intangible value of the in-place leases and $784,000 as the
intangible value of below-market rents. These amounts are recorded to “other
assets” and “other liabilities,” respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2007 and are amortized over the life of the respective
leases.

Of the
$769.9 million invested in 2006, $6.0 million was used to acquire one
property with an existing lease already in-place with a retail
tenant.  In accordance with SFAS 141, Realty Income recorded $1.6
million as the intangible value of the in-place lease and $628,000 as the
intangible value of below-market rents.  These amounts were recorded
to “other assets” and “other liabilities”, respectively, on our consolidated
balance sheet and are amortized over the life of the respective
lease.

4.           Credit
Facility

We have
a $300 million acquisition credit facility that expires in October 2008, unless
extended as provided for in the credit facility agreement. We have the right to
extend the credit facility for an additional term of one year (to October 2009).
Since May 2007, our investment grade credit ratings provided for financing under
the credit facility at LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 60 basis
points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points, for all-in drawn
pricing of 75 basis points over LIBOR.

The
average borrowing rate on our credit facilities during 2007 was 6.0%, compared
to 5.7% in 2006 and 4.3% in 2005 on our previous $250 million credit facility,
which expired in October 2005. The increase in the average borrowing rate is due
to an increase in LIBOR since the beginning of 2005.  The effective
borrowing rate at December 31, 2007 was 5.2% and at December 31, 2006 was
6.0%.  Our current credit facility is subject

to
various leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations. We are and have been
in compliance with these covenants.

Our
credit facility is unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as
collateral for this obligation.  We regularly review our credit
facility and may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility, to the
extent we deem appropriate.

5.           Notes
Payable

Our
senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of December 31,
2007, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):

Interest
incurred on all of the notes for 2007 was $67.1 million, for 2006 was $49.6
million and for 2005 was $39.5 million.  In addition, when our 7.75%
senior unsecured notes due 2007 were redeemed in September 2006, we paid a $1.6
million make-whole payment, which is classified as “loss on extinguishment of
debt” on our consolidated statements of income.  The interest rate on
each of these notes is fixed.

Our
outstanding notes are unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets
as collateral for these or any other obligations.  Interest on all of
the senior note obligations is paid semiannually, with the exception of the
interest on the 8.25% senior notes issued in October 1998 which is paid
monthly.

-57-

All of
these notes contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence
of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed
60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our
secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on
incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be
less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered
assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We have been in
compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were
issued.

In
September 2007, we issued $550 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.75%
senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”).  The price to the
investor for the 2019 Notes was 99.827% of the principal amount for an effective
yield of 6.772%.  The net proceeds of approximately $544.4 million
from this offering were used to fund certain property acquisitions, repay
borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and for general corporate
purposes.  The remaining net proceeds, which are included in “cash and
cash equivalents” on our 2007 consolidated balance sheet, will be used for
general corporate purposes, which include additional property
acquisitions.

In
September 2006, we issued $275 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95%
senior unsecured notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”).  The price to the
investor for the 2016 Notes was 99.74% of the principal amount for an effective
yield of 5.985%.  The net proceeds of approximately
$271.9 million from this offering were used for general corporate purposes
and to redeem the outstanding $110 million 7.75% unsecured notes due May 2007
(the “2007 Notes”), which were issued in May 1997.

In
September 2006, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2007 Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest of
$3.2 million and a make-whole payment of $1.6 million.  We recorded a
loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $1.6 million related to the make-whole
payment associated with the 2007 Notes.  For 2006, the make-whole
payment represented approximately $0.017 per share.

In
September 2005, we issued $175 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375%
senior unsecured notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”).  The price to the
investor for the 2017 Notes was 99.974% of the principal amount for an effective
yield of 5.378%.  The net proceeds of approximately $173.2 million
from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition
credit facility, to fund new property acquisitions and for other general
corporate purposes.

In
March 2005, we issued $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875%
senior unsecured bonds due 2035 (the “2035 Bonds”).  The price to the
investor for the 2035 Bonds was 98.296% of the principal amount for an effective
yield of 5.998%.  The net proceeds of approximately $97 million from this
offering were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and
for other general corporate purposes.

In May
1998, we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement associated with
the 8.25% senior notes issued in October 1998 (the “2008 Notes”). In settlement
of the agreement, we made a payment of $8.7 million in 1998. The payment on the
agreement is being amortized over 10 years (the life of the notes) as a yield
adjustment to interest expense.  After taking into effect the results
of the treasury lock settlement, the effective rate to us on the 2008 Notes is
9.12%.

following table summarizes the maturity of our notes payable as of December 31,

9.           Operating
Leases

A.           At
December 31, 2007, we owned 2,270 properties in 49 states, excluding 30
properties owned by Crest. Of these 2,270 properties, 2,259, or 99.5%, are
single-tenant, retail properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant,
distribution and office properties. At December 31, 2007, 48 properties were
vacant and available for lease or sale.

Substantially
all leases are net leases where the tenant pays property taxes and assessments,
maintains the interior and exterior of the building and leased premises, and
carries insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire and
extended coverage.

Rent
based on a percentage of a tenants’ gross sales (percentage rents) for 2007 was
$851,000, for 2006 was $1.1 million and for 2005 was $1.2 million, including
amounts recorded to discontinued operations.

At
December 31, 2007, minimum future annual rents to be received on the operating
leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in
thousands):

Tenants – No individual tenant’s rental revenue, including percentage rents,
represented more than 10% of our total revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005.

10.           Gain
on Sales of Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest

In
2007, Crest sold 62 properties for $123.6 million, which resulted in a gain of
$12.3 million.  For two property sales during 2007, Crest provided the
buyers partial financing for a total of $3.8 million, of which $619,000 was paid
in full in November 2007.  In 2006, Crest sold 13 properties for $22.4
million, which resulted in a gain of $2.2 million.  In 2005,
Crest sold 12 properties for $23.5 million, which resulted in a gain of
$3.3 million.  In 2005, Crest provided a buyer partial financing
of $1.3 million for one property, which was paid in full in February
2006.  Crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are
included in discontinued operations.

11.           Gain
on Sales of Investment Properties, Improvements and Land by Realty
Income

In
2007, we sold ten investment properties for $7.0 million, which resulted in a
gain of $1.7 million.  This gain is included in discontinued
operations.  In addition, we sold excess land and improvements from
five properties for an aggregate of $4.4 million, which resulted in a gain of
$1.8 million.  This gain from the land and improvements sales is
reported in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of income because
these improvements and excess land were associated with properties that continue
to be owned as part of our core operations.

In
2006, we sold or exchanged 13 investment properties for $10.7 million, which
resulted in a gain of $3.0 million that is included in discontinued
operations.

In
2005, we sold 23 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two
properties for $23.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.6
million.  This gain is included in discontinued operations, except for
$18,000 that is included in “other revenue” on our consolidated statements of
income.

12.           Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

We
believe that the carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2007 and 2006 reasonably approximate the fair values for cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and all liabilities, due to their
short-term nature, except for notes payable. In making these assessments, we
used estimates. The estimated fair value of the notes payable at
December 31, 2007 is $1.413 billion and at December 31, 2006 is
$921.9 million, based upon the closing market price per note or indicative
price per each note at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

13.           Supplemental
Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

Interest
paid in 2007 was $56.7 million, in 2006 was $52.4 million and in 2005 was $36.4
million.

Interest
capitalized to properties under development in 2007 was $993,000, in 2006 was
$2.2 million and in 2005 was $1.9 million.

Income
taxes paid by Realty Income and Crest in 2007 were $4.3 million, in 2006 were
$775,000 and in 2005 were $1.4 million.

The
following non-cash investing and financing activities are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements:

A.

Share-based
      compensation expense for 2007 was $3.9 million, for 2006 was $3.0 million
      and for 2005 was $2.2 million.

B.

See
      “Provisions for Impairment” in note 2 for a discussion of impairments
      recorded by Realty Income and
Crest.

C.

In
      2007, Crest sold two properties for an aggregate of $5.5 million and
      received notes totaling $3.8 million from the buyers, of which
      $619,000 was paid in full in November 2007.   The remaining
      note is included in “other assets” on our December 31, 2007 consolidated
      balance sheet.

D.

In
      connection with the acquisition of seven properties during 2007, we
      acquired restricted escrow funds totaling $2.6 million.  During
      2007, all of these funds were invested in improvements to these
      properties.

E.

In
      accordance with FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
      Retirement Obligations

, we recorded an additional $239,000 of
      estimated legal obligations related to asset retirement obligations on two
      land leases in 2007.  In 2005, an asset retirement obligation
      was originally established for $402,000 to account for the difference
      between our obligations to the landlord under the two land leases and our
      subtenant’s obligations to us under the
  subleases.

F.

In
      2006, we exchanged one of our properties for a different property that was
      leased to the same tenant.  As part of this transaction,
      accumulated depreciation was reduced by $67,000 and a gain of $67,000 was
      recorded.  The original cost of and the value received for the
      property exchanged was $900,000.  This transaction had no impact
      on land or building and
improvements.

G.

In
      2006, we received shares of a public company as settlement of a bankruptcy
      claim associated with a former tenant.  We recorded a value of
      $207,000, which is in “other revenue” on our consolidated income
      statement, based on the closing market price of these shares on December
      31, 2006 and included them in “other assets” on our consolidated balance
      sheet at December 31, 2006.  The shares were sold in January
      2007.

H.

In
      2005, Crest sold a property for $2.8 million and issued a note of
      $1.3 million, which was paid in full in 2006 and is included in
      “other assets” on our December 31, 2005 consolidated balance
      sheet.

I.

Accrued
      costs on properties under development resulted in an increase in buildings
      and improvements and accounts payable of $1.7 million in 2006. In 2005,
      non-cash additions to properties resulted in an increase in buildings of
      $5.4 million and an increase in accounts payable of $5.1
      million.

K.

In
      2004, we recorded an impairment of $716,000 on one property to reduce its
      carrying value to zero.  This loss was the result of a dispute
      with the original owner and tenant in their bankruptcy
      proceeding.  Our title insurance company failed to timely record
      the deed on this property upon our original acquisition, which resulted in
      a claim by the bankruptcy trustee that Realty Income did not have legal
      title to the property.  In the second quarter of 2006, this
      issue was resolved and we obtained title to the property.  At
      that time we reinstated the original carrying value adjusted for
      depreciation on our balance sheet and recorded other revenue of
      $716,000.  We also reversed accrued liabilities and property
      expenses of $133,000 associated with this property.  As part of
      the settlement, these costs became the responsibility of the title
      insurance company.

14.           Employee
Benefit Plan

We have
a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our employees. Under our 401(k)
plan, employees may elect to make contributions to the plan up to a maximum of
60% of their compensation, subject to limits under the IRS Code. We match 50% of
our employee’s contributions, up to 3% of the employee’s compensation. Our
aggregate matching contributions each year have been immaterial to our results
of operations.

15.           Common
Stock Incentive Plan

In
2003, our Board of Directors adopted, and stockholders approved, the 2003
Incentive Award Plan of Realty Income Corporation (the “Stock Plan”) to
enable us to attract and retain the services of directors, employees
and consultants, considered essential to our long-term success, by
offering them an opportunity to own stock in Realty Income and/or
rights that will reflect our growth, development and financial
success.  The Stock Plan was amended and restated by our Board of Directors
in February 2006 and in May 2007.  Under the terms of this plan, the
aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject to options, stock
purchase rights (SPR), stock appreciation rights (SAR) and other
awards will be no more than 3,428,000 shares. The maximum number of shares
that may be subject to options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation
rights and other awards granted under the plan to any individual in
any calendar year may not exceed 1,600,000 shares. This plan has a term of
10 years from the date it was adopted by our Board of Directors, which was March
12, 2003.  To date, we have not issued any SPR or SAR.

The
amount of share-based compensation costs charged against income during 2007 were
$3.9 million, during 2006 were $3.0 million and during 2005 were $2.2
million.

No
stock options were granted after January 1, 2002 and all outstanding options
were fully vested as of December 31, 2006.  Stock options were granted
with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock’s fair market value at the
date of grant. Stock options expire ten years from the date they are granted and
vested over service periods of one, three, four or five years.

remaining term of 3.1 years.

The
intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the
underlying stock at December 31 of each year exceeds the exercise price of the
option.  The market value of the Company’s stock was $27.02, $27.70
and $21.62 at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The total
intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $904,000, $268,000 and $377,000, respectively.  The
total intrinsic value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005 was $143,000 and $67,000, respectively.  The aggregate
intrinsic value of options outstanding was $644,000, $1.6 million and $1.2

Grant
      date fair value.

During
2007, we issued 276,631 shares of common stock under our Stock
Plan.  These shares vest over the following service periods: 20,000
vested upon issuance, 4,000 vest over a service period of one year, 12,000 vest
over a service period of three years, 19,000 vest over a service period of five
years and 221,631 vest over a service period of 10 years.

-64-

Our
Stock Plan was amended on May 15, 2007. For grants made on or after May 15, 2007
the vesting schedule for shares granted to non-employee directors was amended to
the following schedule:

·

Shares
      vest in 33.33% increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the
      date the shares of stock are granted to directors with less than five
      years of service at the date of
grant;

·

Shares
      vest in 50% increments on each of the first two anniversaries of the date
      the shares of stock are granted to directors with six years of service at
      the date of grant;

·

Shares
      are 100% vested on the first anniversary of the date the shares of stock
      are granted to directors with seven years of service at the date of grant;
      and

·

There
      is immediate vesting as of the date the shares of stock are granted to
      directors with eight or more years of service at the date of
      grant.

On May
15, 2007, our Board of Directors also approved a new vesting schedule for shares
granted to employees on or after May 15, 2007, which is as follows:

·

For
      employees age 49 and below at the grant date, shares vest in 10%
      increments on each of the first ten anniversaries of the grant
      date;

·

For
      employees age 50 through 55 at the grant date, shares vest in 20%
      increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant
      date;

·

For
      employees age 56 at the grant date, shares vest in 25% increments on each
      of the first four anniversaries of the grant
  date;

·

For
      employees age 57 at the grant date, shares vest in 33.33% increments on
      each of the first three anniversaries of the grant
  date;

·

For
      employees age 58 at the grant date, shares vest in 50% increments on each
      of the first two anniversaries of the grant
  date;

·

For
      employees age 59 at the grant date, shares are 100% vested on the first
      anniversary of the grant date; and

·

For
      employees age 60 and above at the grant date, shares vest immediately on
      the grant date.

In
addition, after they have been employed for six full months, all non-executive
employees receive 200 shares of nonvested stock which vests over a five year
period.

As of
December 31, 2007, the remaining unamortized share-based compensation expense
totaled $19.4 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
the service period of each applicable award.  The amount of
share-based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock at the grant
date.  We define the grant date as the date the recipient and the
Company have a mutual understanding of the key terms and condition of the award
and the recipient of the grant begins to benefit from, or be adversely affected
by subsequent changes in the price of the shares.

The
effect of pre-vesting forfeitures on our recorded expense has historically been
negligible.  Any future pre-vesting forfeitures are also expected to
be negligible and we will record the benefit related to such forfeitures as they
occur.  Under the terms of our Stock Plan, we pay non-refundable
dividends to the holders of our nonvested shares.  Under Statement No.
123R, the dividends paid to holders of these nonvested shares should be charged
as compensation expense to the extent that they relate to nonvested shares that
do not or are not expected to vest.  Given the negligible historical
and prospective forfeiture rate determined by us, we did not record any amount
to compensation expense related to dividends paid in 2007, 2006 or 2005, nor do
we expect to record any amounts in future periods.

16.           Segment
Information

We
evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by
industry basis. For financial reporting purposes, we have grouped our tenants
into 31 industry and activity segments (including properties owned by Crest that
are grouped together). All of the properties are incorporated into one of the
applicable segments. Because almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay
operating expenses, revenue is the only component of segment profit and loss we
measure.

-65-

The
following tables set forth certain information regarding the properties owned by
us, classified according to the business of the respective tenants as of
December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):

17.           Commitments
and Contingencies

In the
ordinary course of our business, we are party to various legal actions which we
believe are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business.
We believe that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

At
December 31, 2007, we have committed $7.9 million under construction
contracts.  These costs are expected to be paid in the next 12
months.  In addition, we also have contingent payments for tenant
improvements and leasing costs of $743,000.

We have
certain properties that are subject to ground leases which are accounted for as
operating leases.  At December 31, 2007, minimum future rental
payments for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in
thousands):

Realty
      Income currently pays the ground lessor directly for the rent under the

      additional rent from our tenant.

Our
      tenants, who are generally sub-tenants under the ground leases, are
      responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases. In the event a
      tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily
      responsible.

Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on
Accounting and Financial

Disclosure

We have
had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on
accountancy or financial disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two
most recent fiscal years.

Item
9A:

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c)) that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of
and for the year ended December 31, 2007, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the
foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at
a reasonable assurance level.

Management's Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

.

Internal
control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the
supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and
effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and
procedures that:

(1)
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company;

(2)
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the Company; and

(3)
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for the Company.

Management
has used the framework set forth in the report entitled "Internal
Control--Integrated Framework" published by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management has
concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.  KPMG LLP has
issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal
Controls.

There have not been any significant
changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no
material weaknesses in our internal controls, and therefore no corrective
actions were taken.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of
Controls.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot
provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because
of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in
judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal
control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design
into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this
risk.
