PART I

Item 1:

Business

THE COMPANY

Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is an S&P 500 real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations. Our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio. We have in-house acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting, information technology, and capital markets capabilities. Over the past 47 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements.

Realty Income (NYSE: O) was founded in 1969, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in 1994.  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).

We seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management, asset management and the acquisition of additional properties.

Generally, our portfolio and asset management efforts seek to achieve:

·

Contractual rent increases on existing leases;

·

Rent increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions permit;

·

Optimum exposure to certain tenants and markets through re-leasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties;

·

Maximum asset-level returns on properties re-leased and/or sold;

·

Optimum value of the existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties, pursuing alternative uses, and deriving ancillary revenue; and

·

Investment opportunities in new asset classes for the portfolio.

At December 31, 2015, we owned a diversified portfolio:

·

Of 4,538 properties;

·

With an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,467 properties leased and 71 properties available for lease;

·

Leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;

·

Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;

·

With over 76.0 million square feet of leasable space; and

·

With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,750 square feet; approximately 11,550 square feet per retail property and 216,550 square feet per industrial property.

Of the 4,538 properties in the portfolio, 4,519, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2015, of the 4,519 single-tenant properties, 4,448 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.0 years.

Our ten senior officers owned 0.2% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $30.6 million at January 29, 2016. Our directors and ten senior officers, as a group, owned 0.3% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $46.5 million at January 29, 2016.

Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “O” with a CUSIP number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is 726728.

Our 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or the Class F preferred stock,  is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “OprF” with a CUSIP number of 756109-807.

In January 2016, we had 132 employees, as compared to 125 employees in January 2015.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 47-year policy of paying monthly dividends.  In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2015, and two times during 2016.  As of February 2016, we have paid 73 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 84 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.

The dividends paid per share during 2015 totaled approximately $2.2714167, as compared to approximately $2.1916254 during 2014, an increase of $0.0798, or 3.6%.

The monthly dividend of $0.1985 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.382 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.3% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $55.79 on January 29, 2016. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.

Acquisitions During 2015

During 2015, we invested $1.26 billion in 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 6.6%. The 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states, will contain approximately 6.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21 industries and the property types consist of 87.3% retail and 12.7% industrial, based on rental revenue.  During 2015, none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at December 31, 2015.

The estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. Of the $1.26 billion we invested during 2015, $45.8 million was invested in 35 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.7%.  We may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.

Portfolio Discussion

Leasing Results

At December 31, 2015, we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4,538 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.4% occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio.  Since December 31, 2014, when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 4,327 and a 98.4% occupancy rate, we:

·

Had 283 lease expirations;

·

Re-leased 253 properties; and

·

Sold 29 vacant properties.

Of the 253 properties re-leased during 2015, 216 properties were re-leased to existing tenants, seven were re-leased to new tenants without vacancy, and 30 were re-leased to new tenants after a period of vacancy.  The annual rent on these 253 leases was $37.46 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $37.12 million, which represents a rent recapture rate of 100.9% on the properties re-leased during 2015.

At December 31, 2015, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $13.31 per square foot on the 4,467 leased properties in our portfolio.  At December 31, 2015, we classified ten properties with a carrying amount of $9.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet.  The expected disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.

Investments in Existing Properties

In 2015, we capitalized costs of $11.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $748,000 for re-leasing costs, $7.6 million for recurring capital expenditures and $3.2 million for non-recurring building improvements.  In 2014, we capitalized costs of $6.0 million on existing properties in our portfolio.

As part of our re-leasing costs, we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  Leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.

The majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  It is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.

At-the-Market (ATM) Program

In September 2015, we established an “at the market” equity distribution

program, or our ATM program, pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 12,000,000 shares of common stock to, or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  During 2015, we issued 714,301 shares and raised approximately $36.3 million under the ATM program.

New Credit Facility

In June 2015, we closed on a $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, or our new credit facility. Our new credit facility is comprised of a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million five-year unsecured term loan. As of December 31, 2015, $

1.76 billion

was available on our new credit facility to fund additional acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.

Inclusion in S&P Indices

In January 2015, we were added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats

®

index. In April 2015, we were added to the S&P 500 index and are one of 26 REITs, and the only net lease REIT included in this index.

Issuance of Common Stock

In April 2015, we issued 5,500,000 shares of common stock.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $1.4 million, the net proceeds of $276.4 million were used to repay borrowings under our previous $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility.

-


-


In October 2015, we issued 11,500,000 shares of common stock, including 1,500,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.0 million, a portion of the net proceeds of $517.1 million was used to repay borrowings under our new credit facility and the remaining portion was used for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, or the DRSPP, provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions.  The DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions.  The DRSPP authorizes up to 26,000,000 common shares to be issued.  In 2013, we revised our DRSPP so that we would pay for a majority of the plan-related fees, which were previously paid by investors, and to institute a waiver approval process, allowing larger investors or institutions, per a formal approval process, to purchase shares at a small discount, if approved by us. During 2015, we issued 7,608,354 shares and raised approximately $363.0 million under the DRSPP, of which 7,413,207 shares and $353.7 million was raised under the waiver approval process.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $256.7 million in 2015, compared to $227.6 million in 2014, an increase of $29.1 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.09 in 2015, as compared to $1.04 in 2014, an increase of $0.05, or 4.8%.

Net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of Class E preferred stock that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.

The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments and/or gains from the sale of properties. The amount of impairments and/or gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

Gains from the sale of properties during 2015 were $22.2 million, as compared to gains from the sale of properties of $42.1 million during 2014.

Funds from Operations (FFO) Available to Common Stockholders

In 2015, our FFO increased by $89.5 million, or 15.9%, to $652.4 million, compared to $562.9 million in 2014.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $2.77 in 2015, compared to $2.58 in 2014, an increase of $0.19, or 7.4%.  Our

FFO in 2014 included a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of Class E preferred stock that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis.

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) Available to Common Stockholders

In 2015, our AFFO increased by $85.3 million, or 15.2%, to $647.0 million versus $561.7 million in 2014. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $2.74 in 2015, compared to $2.57 in 2014, an increase of $0.17, or 6.6%.

See our discussion of FFO and AFFO (which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP), later in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO.

Dividend Policy

Distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock and Class F preferred stock if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.

Distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P. and Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders.

In order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2015, our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled $560.3 million, or approximately 136.9% of our estimated taxable income of $409.4 million. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance.  We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2015 totaled $533.2 million, representing 82.4% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of $647.0 million. In comparison, our 2014 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $479.3 million, representing 85.3% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of $561.7 million.

The Class F preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.625% per annum on the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.65625 per annum per share). Dividends on our Class F preferred stock are current.

Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our new credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our new credit facility.

Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year).

Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 23.8% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2015, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We estimate that in 2016, between 20% and 35% of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

Investment Philosophy

We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), (2) fixed increases, or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term, net leases generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.

-


-


Diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy.  We believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant, industry, geography, and, to a certain extent, property type leads to more predictable investment results for our shareholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration.  Our investment efforts have led to a diversified property portfolio that, as of December 31, 2015, consisted of 4,538 properties located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industries. Each of the 47 industries represented in our property portfolio individually accounted for no more than 10.9% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  Since 1970, our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%.  However, we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96%.

Investment Strategy

Our investment strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national tenants by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. When identifying new properties for investment, we generally focus on acquiring the real estate tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business. We generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics:

·

Properties that are freestanding, commercially-zoned with a single tenant;

·

Properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for regional and national tenants (i.e. they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business);

·

Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the successful operations of the company’s business;

·

Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants, and have good visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;

·

Properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs;

·

Properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents; and

·

Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases.

We seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national tenants are capturing market share through the selection of prime locations, service, quality control, economies of scale, strong consumer brands, and advertising. In addition, we frequently acquire large portfolios of single-tenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries.  We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various tenants, owners/developers, and advisers to uncover and secure transactions.  We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations, tenants, and industries for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value.

In selecting potential investments, we look for tenants with the following attributes:

·

Tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow;

·

Tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources;

·

Tenants that are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and

·

Tenants that are large owners and users of real estate.

From a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business.  We believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers.  As a result of the execution of this strategy, over 90% of our annualized retail rental revenue is derived from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business.  From a non-retail perspective, we target industrial properties leased to Fortune 1000, primarily investment grade rated companies.  We believe rental revenue generated from businesses with these characteristics is generally more durable and stable.

After applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted returns.

-


-


Underwriting Strategy

We believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers, and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue, we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive.  Therefore, in the event of reorganization, they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that are weaker performers.

In order to be considered for acquisition, properties must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit criteria. We have established a four-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:

·

Overall real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative rental rates;

·

Industry, company, market conditions, and credit profile;

·

Store profitability for retail locations, if profitability data is available; and

·

The importance of the real estate location to the operations of the tenants’ business.

Prior to entering into any transaction, our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality.  The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics.  We conduct additional due diligence, including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates.  We continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed, and providing summaries of these findings to management.  We estimate that approximately 44% of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade rated companies or their subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2015, our top 20 tenants represent approximately 55% of our annualized revenue and eight of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies.

Asset Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants, our tenants’ industries and the locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality.

We regularly review and analyze:

·

The quality of the underlying real estate locations;

·

The performance of the various industries of our tenants; and

·

The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants.

We have an active asset management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:

·

Generate higher returns;

·

Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

·

Extend our average remaining lease term; or

·

Decrease tenant or industry concentration.

At December 31, 2015, we classified ten properties with a carrying amount of $9.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. For 2016, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate $50 to $75 million in property sales in 2016.  We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2016 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.

Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long-term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our new credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.

Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our new credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings.

Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2015, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $4.85 billion, or approximately 26.6% of our total market capitalization of $18.22 billion.

We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2015 as the sum of:

·

Shares of our common stock outstanding of 250,416,757, plus total common units outstanding of 648,386, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $51.63 per share on December 31, 2015, or $12.96 billion;

·

Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class F preferred stock of $408.8 million;

·

Outstanding borrowings of $238.0 million on our new credit facility;

·

Outstanding mortgages payable of $637.7 million, excluding net mortgage premiums of $9.1 million;

·

Outstanding borrowings of $320.0 million on our term loans; and

·

Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $3.65 billion, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $13.3 million.

Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.

Universal Shelf Registration

In December 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in December 2018. This replaced our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.

$2.0 Billion Revolving Credit Facility

In June 2015, we entered into a new $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our $1.5 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2016. The initial term of our new credit facility expires in June 2019 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions. Our new credit facility has a $1.0 billion accordion expansion option.  Under our new credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 0.9%, with a facility commitment fee of 0.15%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.05% over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor. We also have other interest rate options available to us under our new credit facility. Our new credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.

-


At December 31, 2015, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.76 billion available on our new credit facility and an outstanding balance of $238.0 million.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility, at December 31, 2015, was 1.2% per annum.  We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  At December 31, 2015, we remain in compliance with these covenants. We expect to use our new credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.

We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms.

Cash Reserves

We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $40.3 million.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our new credit facility.

Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing interest rates under our new credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 with a “stable” outlook, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes, and Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook.

Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 0.9% with a facility commitment fee of 0.15%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.05% over LIBOR.  Our new credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 1.55% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated and (ii) LIBOR plus 0.85% if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.3% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.125% for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.

We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

Notes Outstanding

As of December 31, 2015, we had $3.65 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $13.3 million.  All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.

-


-


Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2015, we had $637.7 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions.  Additionally, at December 31, 2015, we had net premiums totaling $9.1 million on these mortgages.  We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so.  During 2015, we made $198.4 million of principal payments, including the repayment of 13 mortgages in full for $191.0 million.

Term Loans

In June 2015, in conjunction with entering into our new credit facility, we entered into a $250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing June 30, 2020.  Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus 0.95%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.67%.

In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in January 2018.  Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus 1.20%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.15%.

No Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.

Corporate Responsibility

We are committed to providing an engaging, diverse, and safe work environment for our employees, to upholding our corporate responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of our shareholders, and to operating our company in an environmentally conscious manner. As The Monthly Dividend Company®, our mission is to provide monthly dividends to our shareholders that increase over time. How we manage and use the physical, financial and talent resources that enable us to achieve this mission, demonstrates our commitment to corporate responsibility.

Social Responsibility and Ethics.

An extension of our mission is our commitment to being socially responsible and conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. Our employees are awarded compensation that is in line with those of our peers and competitors, including generous healthcare benefits for employees and their families; participation in a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution by Realty Income; competitive paid time-off benefits; and an infant-at-work program for new parents. Our employees have access to members of our Board of Directors to report anonymously, if desired, any suspicion of misconduct by any member of our senior management or executive team. We also have a longstanding commitment to equal employment opportunity and adhere to all Equal Employer Opportunity Policy guidelines. We apply the principles of full and fair disclosure in all of our business dealings, as outlined in our Corporate Code of Business Ethics. We are also committed to dealing fairly with all of our customers, suppliers, and competitors.

Realty Income and our employees have taken an active role in supporting our communities through civic involvement with charitable organizations and corporate donation. Focusing our impact on social and environmentally sustainable areas our non-profit partnerships have resulted in 600 employee volunteer hours, employee and corporate donations to fund local affordable housing, educations services to at-risk youth, funding local foodbanks, and toys for under-served children. Our dedication to be a responsible corporate citizen has a direct and positive impact in the communities in which we operate and contributes to the strength of our reputation and our financial performance.

Corporate Governance.

We believe that a company’s reputation for integrity and serving its shareholders responsibly is of utmost importance. We are committed to managing the company for the benefit of our shareholders and are focused on maintaining good corporate governance.  Practices that illustrate this commitment include:

·

Our Board of Directors is comprised of eight directors, seven of which are independent, non-employee directors;

·

Our Board of Directors is elected on an annual basis;

·

We employ a majority vote standard for uncontested elections;

-


-


·

Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors works with independent consultants in conducting annual compensation reviews for our key executives, and compensates each individual based on primarily reaching certain performance metrics that determine the success of our company; and

·

We adhere to all other corporate governance principles outlined in our “Corporate Governance Guidelines” document on our website.

Environmental Practices.

Our focus on conservationism is demonstrated by how we manage our day-to-day activities at our corporate headquarters.  At our headquarters, we promote energy efficiency and encourage practices such as powering down office equipment at the end of the day, implementing file-sharing technology and automatic “duplex mode” to limit paper use, adopting an electronic approval system, and carpooling to our headquarters. With respect to technology, recycling and reuse practices, we encourage the use of recycled products and the recycling of materials during our operations. Cell phones, wireless devices and office equipment are recycled or donated whenever possible. In addition, our headquarters was constructed according to the State of California energy efficiency standards (specifically following California Green Building Standards Code and Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations), with features such as an automatic lighting control system with light-harvesting technology, a Building Management System that monitors and controls energy use, an energy-efficient PVC roof and heating and cooling system, and drought-tolerant landscaping with recycled materials.

The properties in our portfolio are net leased to our tenants who are responsible for maintaining the buildings and are in control of their energy usage and environmental sustainability practices.  We remain active in working with our tenants to promote environmental responsibility at the properties we own.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

At December 31, 2015, we owned a diversified portfolio:

·

Of 4,538 properties;

·

With an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,467 properties leased and 71 properties available for lease;

·

Leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;

·

Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;

·

With over 76.0 million square feet of leasable space; and

·

With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,750 square feet; approximately 11,550 square feet per retail property and 216,550 square feet per industrial property.

At December 31, 2015, of our 4,538 properties, 4,467 were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.

At December 31, 2015, our 240 commercial tenants, which we define as retailers with over 50 locations and non-retailers with over $500 million in annual revenues, represented approximately 95% of our annualized revenue.  We had 279 additional tenants, representing approximately 5% of our annualized revenue at December 31, 2015, which brings our total tenant count to 519 tenants.

This “Risk Factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders.”  Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock, while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock.

In order to grow w

e need to continue to acquire investment properties.  The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.

We face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties. We expect competition from:

·

Businesses;

·

Individuals;

·

Fiduciary accounts and plans; and

·

Other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.

Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.

Cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:

·

Lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;

·

Inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;

·

Oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;

·

Declines in our tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators;

·

Defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations;

·

Economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and

·

Deterioration of physical condition of our properties.

At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent, or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant’s lease and material losses to us.

If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties.  Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements, or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.

Further, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant’s lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against a tenant for terminated leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a tenant’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness.

Seventy-one of our properties were available for lease or sale at December 31, 2015, all of which were single-tenant properties. At December 31, 2015, forty-six of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. During 2015, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.

For 2015, our tenants in the “drug store” industry accounted for approximately 10.9% of our rental revenue. A downturn in this industry, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the United States, or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs, could adversely affect tenants in this industry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock, including the common stock offered hereby, and preferred stock.

Individually, each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for 2015. Nevertheless, downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock, and preferred stock. In addition, we may in the future make additional investments in the “drug store” industry, which would increase this industry’s percentage of our rental revenues, thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in this industry would have on us.

In addition, some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have limited financial and other resources, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional, national, or international economy.

Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net lease locations in the United States. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the United States and properties leased to tenants engaged in non-retail businesses. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of any non-U.S. jurisdiction.

As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.

Investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of:

·

Our knowledge of the contamination;

·

The timing of the contamination;

·

The cause of the contamination; or

·

The party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances.

The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims. Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.

-


-


In addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

It is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and/or that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants’ activities on the properties. For properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements, obtaining environmental insurance, or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation.  However, it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.

Compliance.

We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties. In addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal, state, and local laws relating to ACMs. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest.

Insurance and Indemnity.

In July 2012, we entered into a ten-year environmental insurance policy that expires in July 2022 and replaced our previous seven-year environmental insurance policy. The limits on our current policy are $10 million per occurrence and $60 million in the aggregate.  The limits on the excess policy are $5 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate.  Therefore, the primary and excess ten-year policies together provide a total limit of $15 million per occurrence and $70 million in the aggregate.

It is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties.  For properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.

Commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

-


-


For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).

In the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.

If we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

·

We would be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

·

We would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income;

·

We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;

·

We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

·

This treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries, including Crest, are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property.  Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.

To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.

In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.

We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.

Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.

Our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our Board of Directors). Accordingly, our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.

-


-


We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets.

We have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership, which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of our common stock.  This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain.  Similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases.  These restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.

We are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.

We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2015, we had $238.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, a total of $3.65 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities (excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $13.3 million), $320 million of borrowings outstanding under a senior unsecured term loan and approximately $637.7 million of outstanding mortgage debt (excluding net premiums totaling $9.1 million on these mortgages). To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time.  We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis, we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money.

In addition, our revolving credit facility, our term loan facilities, and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.  In particular, our revolving credit facility and our $250 million term loan facility, both of which are governed by the same credit agreement, provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) exists, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may make any dividends or other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:

·

The sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreement) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period, and

·

The minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the Code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders,

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock. The credit agreement further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement, we and our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not pay any dividends or other distributions on (except for (a) distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and (b) dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock. If any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities, could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those dividends or other distributions altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT. Likewise, one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our $70.0 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth (as defined in the term loan facility) above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants. This minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary, as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary, to provide funds to us in order to pay dividends and other distributions on our common stock, including the shares of common stock offered hereby, and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness. Any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will, and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in our $70.0 million term loan facility may, result in an event of default under that facility, which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our revolving credit facility as described above.

-


-


Our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock, preferred stock, and debt securities, including:

·

Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

·

Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

·

Requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements;

·

Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and

·

Putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.

If we default under a credit facility, loan agreement or other debt instrument, the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral.

In addition, we have 16,350,000 shares of Class F preferred stock outstanding, the holders of which are entitled to receive, before any dividends are paid on our common stock, monthly dividends, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us, at the rate of $1.65625 per annum per share. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with preferred stock financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends on our preferred stock.

Our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

The market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.

The market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including:

·

Prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;

·

The market for similar securities issued by other REITs;

·

General economic and financial market conditions;

·

The financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;

·

Changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations;

·

Litigation and regulatory proceedings;

·

Changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;

·

Changes in our credit ratings; and

·

Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.

-


-


In addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the United States, or U.S., trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

Real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.

We are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate.  In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:

·

Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;

·

Changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

·

Changes in interest rates and operating expenses;

·

Competition for tenants;

·

Changes in market rental rates;

·

Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

·

Renewal of leases at lower rental rates;

·

Inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;

·

Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate;

·

Uninsured property liability;

·

Property damage or casualty losses;

·

Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements, including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;

·

The need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;

·

Development oriented activities;

·

Physical or weather-related damage to properties;

·

The potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;

·

Acts of terrorism and war; and

·

Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.

Real estate property investments are illiquid; therefore, the company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.

We are engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions.

An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenant’s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates.

-


-


In addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above, many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.

In addition, although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects (such as claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. If a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

Litigation risks could affect our business.

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management.

Property taxes may increase without notice.

The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.

-


-


We depend on key personnel.

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry.

Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.

Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants, our business or the United States generally.

If events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the theft of intellectual property, personal information, or personal property, such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, result in theft of company assets, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.

Over the last several years, the United States stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. In addition, the ongoing global financial crisis (which includes concerns that certain European countries may be unable to pay their national debt) has had a similar effect. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Unrest in certain Middle Eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets.  Continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.

-


-


Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants’ ability to pay rent.

Current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.

Various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.

Inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets. Any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, civil litigation or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which may

adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, in conjunction with the SEC, has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions, including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the International Accounting Standards Board. At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty which, if any, proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements, our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants.

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders and shareholder advisory firms.

Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. If we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future, our business could be adversely affected, as such activities could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties, tenants and financing sources, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If potential or existing sellers of properties, tenants or financing sources choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, we may suffer damage to our reputation (for example, regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations) or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents, including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities, including the notes, resulting in significant loss of value, which could impact our ability to access capital, increase our cost of capital, and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms.

Our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock.

Our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT for United States federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock. These restrictions could have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

GENERAL

Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is an S&P 500 real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations. Our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio. We have in-house acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting, information technology, and capital markets capabilities. Over the past 47 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements.

Realty Income (NYSE: O) was founded in 1969, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in 1994.  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).

We seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio management, asset management and the acquisition of additional properties.

At December 31, 2015, we owned a diversified portfolio:

·

Of 4,538 properties;

·

With an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,467 properties leased and 71 properties available for lease;

·

Leased to 240 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;

·

Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;

·

With over 76.0 million square feet of leasable space; and

·

With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,750 square feet; approximately 11,550 square feet per retail property and 216,550 square feet per industrial property.

Of the 4,538 properties in the portfolio, 4,519, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2015, of the 4,519 single-tenant properties, 4,448 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.0 years.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.

Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our new $2.0 billion credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings.

Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2015, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $4.85 billion, or approximately 26.6% of our total market capitalization of $18.22 billion.

-


-


We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2015 as the sum of:

·

Shares of our common stock outstanding of 250,416,757, plus total common units outstanding of 648,386, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $51.63 per share on December 31, 2015, or $12.96 billion;

·

Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class F preferred stock of $408.8 million;

·

Outstanding borrowings of $238.0 million on our new credit facility;

·

Outstanding mortgages payable of $637.7 million, excluding net mortgage premiums of $9.1 million;

·

Outstanding borrowings of $320.0 million on our term loans; and

·

Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $3.65 billion, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $13.3 million.

Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2015, we had $637.7 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions.  Additionally, at December 31, 2015, we had net premiums totaling $9.1 million on these mortgages.  We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that will make it economically feasible to do so.  During 2015, we made $198.4 million of principal payments, including the repayment of 13 mortgages in full for $191.0 million.

Term Loans

In June 2015, in conjunction with entering into our new credit facility, we entered into a $250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing June 30, 2020.  Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one month LIBOR, plus 0.95%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.67%.

In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in January 2018.  Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus 1.20%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.15%.

$2.0 Billion Revolving Credit Facility

In June 2015, we entered into a new $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or our new credit facility, which replaced our $1.5 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2016. The initial term of our new credit facility expires in June 2019 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions. Our new credit facility has a $1.0 billion accordion expansion option.  Under our new credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR, plus 0.9% with a facility commitment fee of 0.15%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.05% over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor. We also have other interest rate options available to us under our new credit facility. Our new credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.

At December 31, 2015, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.76 billion available on our new credit facility and an outstanding balance of $238.0 million.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility, at December 31, 2015, was 1.2% per annum.  We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  At December 31, 2015, we remain in compliance with these covenants. We expect to use our new credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.

We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms.

Notes Outstanding

As of December 31, 2015, we had $3.65 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $13.3 million.  All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.

Cash Reserves

We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $40.3 million.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our new credit facility.

Acquisitions During 2015

During 2015, we invested $1.26 billion in 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 6.6%. The 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states, will contain approximately 6.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21 industries and the property types consist of 87.3% retail and 12.7% industrial, based on rental revenue.  During 2015, none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at December 31, 2015.

The estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. Of the $1.26 billion we invested during 2015, $45.8 million was invested in 35 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.7%.  We may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.

Portfolio Discussion

Leasing Results

At December 31, 2015, we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4,538 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.4% occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio.  Since December 31, 2014, when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 4,327 and a 98.4% occupancy rate, we:

·

Had 283 lease expirations;

·

Re-leased 253 properties; and

·

Sold 29 vacant properties.

Of the 253 properties re-leased during 2015, 216 properties were re-leased to existing tenants, seven were re-leased to new tenants without vacancy, and 30 were re-leased to new tenants after a period of vacancy.  The annual rent on these 253 leases was $37.46 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $37.12 million, which represents a rent recapture rate of 100.9% on the properties re-leased during 2015.

At December 31, 2015, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $13.31 per square foot on the 4,467 leased properties in our portfolio.  At December 31, 2015, we classified ten properties with a carrying amount of $9.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet.  The expected disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.

Investments in Existing Properties

In 2015, we capitalized costs of $11.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $748,000 for re-leasing costs, $7.6 million for recurring capital expenditures and $3.2 million for non-recurring building improvements.  In 2014, we capitalized costs of $6.0 million on existing properties in our portfolio.

As part of our re-leasing costs, we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  Leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.

The majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  It is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.

Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.

Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 47-year policy of paying monthly dividends.  In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2015, and two times during 2016.  As of February 2016, we have paid 73 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 84 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.

The dividends paid per share during 2015 totaled approximately $2.2714167, as compared to approximately $2.1916254 during 2014, an increase of $0.0798, or 3.6%.

The monthly dividend of $0.1985 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.382 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.3% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $55.79 on January 29, 2016. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.

Universal Shelf Registration

In December 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in December 2018. This replaced our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.

Issuance of Common Stock

In October 2015, we issued 11,500,000 shares of common stock, including 1,500,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.0 million, a portion of the net proceeds of $517.1 million was used to repay borrowings under our new credit facility and the remaining portion was used for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

In April 2015, we issued 5,500,000 shares of common stock.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $1.4 million, the net proceeds of $276.4 million were used to repay borrowings under our previous $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, or the DRSPP, provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions.  The DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions.  The DRSPP authorizes up to 26,000,000 common shares to be issued.  In 2013, we revised our DRSPP so that we would pay for a majority of the plan-related fees, which were previously paid by investors, and to institute a waiver approval process, allowing larger investors or institutions, per a formal approval process, to purchase shares at a small discount, if approved by us. During 2015, we issued 7,608,354 shares and raised approximately $363.0 million under the DRSPP, of which 7,413,207 shares and $353.7 million was raised under the waiver approval process.

At-the-Market (ATM) Program

In September 2015, we established an “at the market” equity distribution

program, or our ATM program, pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 12,000,000 shares of common stock to, or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  During 2015, we issued 714,301 shares and raised approximately $36.3 million under the ATM program.

Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing interest rates under our new credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 with a “stable” outlook, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes, and Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook.

Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 0.9% with a facility commitment fee of 0.15%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.05% over LIBOR.  Our new credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 1.55% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated and (ii) LIBOR plus 0.85% if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.3% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.125% for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.

We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

Notes Outstanding

Our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of December 31, 2015, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):

All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants, which we remain in compliance with at December 31, 2015. Additionally, interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.

The following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. These calculations, which are not based on U.S. GAAP measurements, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants, and are not measures of our liquidity or performance.  The actual amounts as of December 31, 2015 are:

(1)

This covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any Debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other Debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our Debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on January 1, 2015, and subject to certain additional adjustments.  Such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of January 1, 2015, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period.  The following is our calculation of debt service coverage at December 31, 2015 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):

-


Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator.  Similar to debt service coverage ratio, we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments.  Our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  The presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any U.S. GAAP operating performance measures.  Below is our calculation of fixed charges at December 31, 2015 (in thousands, for the trailing twelve months):

Table of Obligations

The following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):

(1)

The initial term of the credit facility expires in June 2019 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions.

(2)

Excludes non-cash original issuance discounts recorded on the notes payable.  The unamortized balance of the original issuance discounts at December 31, 2015, is $13.3 million.

(3)

Excludes non-cash net premiums recorded on the mortgages payable.  The unamortized balance of these net premiums at December 31, 2015, is $9.1 million.

(4)

Interest on the term loans, notes, bonds, mortgages payable, and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of December 31, 2015 through their respective maturity dates.

(5)

Realty Income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases.

(6)

Our tenants, who are generally sub-tenants under ground leases, are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases. In the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily responsible.

(7)

“Other” consists of $70.6 million of commitments under construction contracts and $714,000 of commitments for tenant improvements and leasing costs.

Our new credit facility, term loans, and notes payable obligations are unsecured. Accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations.

Preferred Stock and Preferred Units Outstanding

In 2006, we issued 8,800,000 shares of Class E preferred stock at a price of $25.00 per share. In October 2014, we redeemed all of the 8,800,000 shares of our Class E preferred stock for $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. In the third quarter of 2014, we incurred a charge of $6.0 million, representing the Class E preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2006.

In February 2012, we issued 14,950,000 shares of our Class F preferred stock at $25.00 per share. In April 2012, we issued an additional 1,400,000 shares of Class F preferred stock at $25.2863 per share. Beginning February 15, 2017, shares of our Class F preferred stock are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends on the shares of our Class F preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears. We are current on our obligations to pay dividends on our Class F preferred stock.

-


As part of our acquisition of ARCT in January 2013, we issued 6,750 partnership units, with a carrying value of $6.75 million. Payments on these preferred units were made monthly in arrears at rate of 2% per annum, or $135,000, and are included in interest expense. In January 2015, we redeemed all 6,750 Tau Operating Partnership preferred units for $1,000 per unit, plus accrued and unpaid distributions.

No Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. One of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties. Depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 20 years for improvements, which we believe are appropriate estimates of useful life. If we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  When acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and tenant relationships, as applicable.  In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties.  The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the market where the property is located.  In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, tenant investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets.  The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.  Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which does not exceed one year.  The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.

Another significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. Key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, historical sales and releases, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. The carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. Our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. However, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.

The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Rental Revenue

Rental revenue was $976.9 million for 2015, as compared to $893.5 million for 2014, an increase of $83.4 million, or 9.3%. Rental revenue was $748.2 million for 2013. The increase in rental revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to:

·

The 248 properties (5.6 million square feet) we acquired in 2015, which generated $41.9 million of rent in 2015;

·

The 479 properties (9.3 million square feet) we acquired in 2014, which generated $99.3 million of rent in 2015, compared to $65.9 million in 2014, an increase of $33.4 million;

·

Same store rents generated on 3,636 properties (58.1 million square feet) during 2015 and 2014, increased by $10.2 million, or 1.3%, to $794.4 million from $784.2 million;

·

A net increase in straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of $4.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014;

·

A net decrease of $8.4 million relating to properties sold in 2015 and during 2014 that were reported in continuing operations; and

·

A net increase of $2.3 million relating to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from properties (137 properties comprising 1.2 million square feet) that were available for lease during part of 2015 or 2014, (ii) rental revenue for 22 properties under development, and (iii) lease termination settlements.  In aggregate, the revenues for these items totaled $26.5 million in 2015, compared to $24.2 million in 2014.

For purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, and (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. Each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period.

Of the 4,538 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2015, 4,519, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. Of the 4,519 single-tenant properties, 4,448, or 98.4%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.0 years at December 31, 2015. Of our 4,448 leased single-tenant properties, 3,938 or 88.5% were under leases that provide for increases in rents through:

·

Base rent increases tied to a consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings);

·

Percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales;

·

Fixed increases; or

·

A combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $4.5 million in 2015, $3.6 million in 2014, and $2.9 million in 2013.  Percentage rent in 2015 was less than 1% of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1% of rental revenue in 2016.

Our portfolio of real estate, leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases, continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders.  At December 31, 2015, our portfolio of 4,538 properties was 98.4% leased with 71 properties available for lease, as compared to 98.4% leased, with 70 properties available for lease at December 31, 2014. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 4% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future.

Tenant Reimbursements

Contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were $42.0 million in 2015, compared to $37.1 million in 2014 and $24.9 million in 2013.  The increase in tenant reimbursements is primarily due to our acquisitions during 2014 and 2015.  Our tenant reimbursements approximate our reimbursable property expenses for any given period.

Other Revenue

Other revenue, which comprises property-related revenue not included in rental revenue or tenant reimbursements, was $4.4 million in 2015, compared to $2.9 million in 2014 and $7.0 million in 2013.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization was $409.2 million for 2015, compared to $374.7 million for 2014 and $306.8 million for 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2014 and 2015, which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods.  As discussed in the sections entitled “Funds from Operations (FFO) Available to Common Stockholders” and “Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) Available to Common Stockholders,” depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of FFO and AFFO.

Interest Expense

The following is a summary of the components of our interest expense (dollars in thousands):

The increase in interest expense from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to the June 2014 issuance of our 3.88% senior unsecured notes due July 2024, the September 2014 issuance of our 4.125% senior unsecured notes due October 2026, the interest expense on the $250 million term loan that was entered into during June 2015, and the payoff of mortgages during 2015 which reduced the amortization of net mortgage premiums.  Additionally, each quarter we adjust the carrying value of our interest rate swaps to fair value.  Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded directly to interest expense.  We recorded a loss on interest rate swaps of $3.0 million and $1.3 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a gain on interest rate swaps of $878,000 during 2013.

The increase in interest expense from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the July 2013 issuance of our 4.65% senior unsecured notes due August 2023, the June 2014 issuance of our 3.88% senior unsecured notes due July 2024, the September 2014 issuance of our 4.125% senior unsecured notes due October 2026, and an increase in mortgages payable. The increase was partially offset by slightly lower average interest rates and the repayment of our 5.375% senior unsecured notes in March 2013.

At December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on our:

·

Notes and bonds payable of $3.65 billion (excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $13.3 million) was 4.7%;

-


-


·

Mortgages payable of $637.7 million (excluding net premiums totaling $9.1 million on these mortgages) was 5.0%;

·

Credit facility outstanding borrowings of $238.0 million was 1.2%;

·

Term loans outstanding borrowings of $320.0 million was 1.2%; and

·

Combined outstanding notes, bonds, mortgages, term loan and credit facility borrowings of $4.85 billion was 4.4%.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.8 million to $49.3 million for 2015, compared to $51.1 million in 2014.  General and administrative expenses were $56.9 million in 2013.  Included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of $913,000 for 2015, $453,000 for 2014, and $2.1 million for 2013. General and administrative expenses slightly decreased during 2015 primarily due to lower compensation costs, lower corporate insurance premiums, and lower proxy costs.

General and administrative expenses decreased during 2014 primarily due to lower stock compensation costs, including the $3.7 million for accelerated vesting that occurred in July 2013, and lower acquisition transaction costs.

In January 2016, we had 132 employees, as compared to 125 employees in January 2015 and 116 employees in January 2014.

(1)

Excludes all tenant reimbursements revenue, as well as revenue included in discontinued operations and gain on sales.

Property Expenses (including tenant reimbursable expenses)

Property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties, leased properties and general portfolio expenses, as well as contractually obligated reimbursable costs from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. Expenses related to unleased properties and expenses we are responsible for on some of the leased properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. General portfolio expenses include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections, and title search fees. At December 31, 2015, 71 properties were available for lease, as compared to 70 properties at December 31, 2014 and 70 properties at December 31, 2013.

Property expenses were $55.4 million (including $42.0 million in reimbursable expenses) in 2015 and $53.9 million (including $37.1 million in reimbursable expenses) in 2014 and $38.9 million (including $24.9 million in reimbursable expenses) in 2013. The increase in gross property expenses in 2015 is primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size, which contributed to higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our acquisitions during 2014 and 2015.

While the gross property expenses have increased, our net property expenses (net of tenant reimbursements) has decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014.  The net expenses have decreased primarily due to lower portfolio vacancy, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time maintenance expenses.

(1)

Excludes all tenant reimbursements revenue, as well as revenue included in discontinued operations and gain on sales.

Income Taxes

Income taxes were $3.2 million in 2015, compared to $3.5 million in 2014 and $2.4 million in 2013. These amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by Realty Income and its subsidiaries.

The increase for 2014 is primarily related to higher city and state income and franchise taxes paid by Realty Income and its subsidiaries, primarily related to increased portfolio size.

Provisions for Impairment

In 2015, we recorded total provisions for impairment of $10.6 million on three properties classified as held for sale, four properties classified as held for investment, seven sold properties, and one property disposed of other than by sale. These properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08, which amends Topic 205,

Presentation of Financial Statements

, and Topic 360,

Property, Plant, and Equipment

; accordingly, the provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In 2014, Realty Income recorded total provisions for impairment of $4.6 million.  Provisions for impairment of $4.1 million are included in income from continuing operations on nine sold properties and two properties classified as held for investment. These properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of ASU 2014-08; accordingly, these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income.  Additionally, a provision for impairment of $510,000 is included in income from discontinued operations on one sold property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013.

In 2013, Realty Income recorded total provisions for impairment of $3.0 million.  Realty Income recorded provisions for impairment of $2.7 million in income from discontinued operations on seven sold properties.  Except for a provision for impairment of $290,000 that was recorded in income from continuing operations for one property that was not previously classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013, the remaining provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income. In 2013, Crest also recorded a provision for impairment of $308,000 on one sold property which is included in income from discontinued operations.

Merger-Related Costs

Merger-related costs include, but are not limited to, advisor fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of ARCT.  Merger-related costs were $13.0 million in 2013.  On a diluted per common share basis, these expenses represented $0.07 for 2013.  No merger-related costs were incurred in 2014 or 2015.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate

During 2015, we sold 38 investment properties for $65.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.2 million.  The results of operations for these properties are presented within continuing operations.

During 2014, we sold 46 investment properties for $107.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $42.1 million.  Only the results of operations specifically related to the properties classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013 and sold during 2014 were reclassified as discontinued operations.

During 2013, we sold 75 investment properties for $134.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $64.7 million.  The results of operations for these properties were reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

During 2015, Crest did not sell any properties.  Crest sold one property for $820,000 and one property for $597,000 during 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Neither of these sales resulted in a gain. The results of operations for these properties were reclassified as discontinued operations.

We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:

·

Generate higher returns;

·

Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

·

Extend our average remaining lease term; or

·

Decrease tenant or industry concentration.

At December 31, 2015, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $9.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately $50 to $75 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2016.  We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available.

-


-


However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.

Preferred Stock Dividends

Preferred stock dividends totaled $27.1 million in 2015, $37.1 million in 2014, and $41.9 million in 2013.

Excess of Redemption Value over Carrying Value of Preferred Shares Redeemed

In October 2014, we redeemed all 8,800,000 shares of our 6.75% Monthly Income Class E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or the Class E preferred stock, for $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. We incurred a non-cash charge of $6.0 million. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $256.7 million in 2015, compared to $227.6 million in 2014, an increase of $29.1 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.09 in 2015, as compared to $1.04 in 2014, an increase of $0.05, or 4.8%. Net income available to common stockholders was $203.6 million in 2013, or $1.06 on a diluted per common share basis.

Net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of Class E preferred stock that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006. Net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales, which represents $0.18 on a diluted per common share basis.  Additionally, net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes $13.0 million of merger-related costs for the acquisition of ARCT, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis, and $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in July 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.

The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments and/or gains from the sale of properties. The amount of impairments and/or gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

Gains from the sale of properties during 2015 were $22.2 million, as compared to gains from the sale of properties of $42.1 million during 2014.

Discontinued Operations

During the first quarter of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that changed the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results.  We early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014.  Starting with the first quarter of 2014, the results of operations for all qualifying disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income. For 2014, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $2.8 million, or $0.01 per common share, basic and diluted. For 2013, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $65.7 million, or $0.34 per common share, basic and diluted.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO) AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

In 2015, our FFO increased by $89.5 million, or 15.9%, to $652.4 million, compared to $562.9 million in 2014.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $2.77 in 2015, compared to $2.58 in 2014, an increase of $0.19, or 7.4%.  In 2013, FFO was $462.0 million, or $2.41 on a diluted per common share basis.

Our FFO in 2014 included a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of Class E preferred stock that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.  FFO in 2013 was normalized to exclude $13.0 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis for 2013.  FFO for 2013 includes $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in July 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.   All references to FFO for 2013 reflect the adjustments for merger-related costs for the acquisition of ARCT.

The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

(1)

FFO for 2013 has been normalized to exclude ARCT merger-related costs.

(2)

The computation of diluted FFO does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted FFO per share in a given period.

We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets, reduced by gains on property sales and extraordinary items.

-


-


We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for FFO. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility.

ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO) AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

In 2015, our AFFO increased by $85.3 million, or 15.2%, to $647.0 million, compared to $561.7 million in 2014. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $2.74 in 2015, compared to $2.57 in 2014, an increase of $0.17, or 6.6%.  In 2013, AFFO was $463.1 million, or $2.41 on a diluted per common share basis. We consider AFFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term “CAD” (for Cash Available for Distribution), “FAD” (for Funds Available for Distribution) or other terms.

The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

(1)

See reconciling items for FFO presented under “Funds from Operations (FFO) Available to Common Stockholders.”

(2)

Includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized upon issuance of our notes payable, assumption of our mortgages payable and upon issuance of our term loans.  The deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loans.  No costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included.

(3)

Includes adjustments allocable to both non-controlling interests and capital lease obligations.

(4)

The computation of diluted AFFO does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted AFFO per share in a given period.

-


-


We believe the non-GAAP financial measure AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies.  In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company’s on-going operating performance.  Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.

Presentation of the information regarding FFO and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.  In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions, or of our ability to pay interest payments.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’ sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), or fixed increases. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation.

Of our 4,538 properties in our portfolio, approximately 98.0% or 4,467 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses. Net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue.

IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our new credit facility, term loans, mortgages payable, and long-term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives we issue long-term notes and bonds, primarily at fixed rates.

In order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and caps. The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, including counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract.  To limit counterparty credit risk we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities.  We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

-


-


The following table presents by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2015. This information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

Expected Maturity Data

(1)

Excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable and original issuance discounts recorded on notes payable.  At December 31, 2015, the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable was $9.1 million, and the unamortized balance of original issuance discounts on notes payable was $13.3 million.

(2)

We base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes and bonds at December 31, 2015 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable.  We base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at December 31, 2015 on the relevant Treasury yield curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread.  We believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance and term loans balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at December 31, 2015.

The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2015. It does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.

All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. All of our mortgages payable, except four mortgages totaling $51.1 million at December 31, 2015, including net unamortized discounts, have fixed interest rates. After factoring in arrangements that limit our exposure to interest rate risk and effectively fix our per annum interest rates, our variable rate mortgage debt includes two mortgages totaling $15.5 million at December 31, 2015. Interest on our new credit facility and term loan balances is variable. However, the variable interest rate feature on our term loans has been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements.  Based on our new credit facility balance of $238.0 million at December 31, 2015, a 1% change in interest rates would change our interest costs by $2.4 million per year.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule III. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Realty Income Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Realty Income Corporation changed its method for reporting discontinued operations in 2014 due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 11, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:

We have audited Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Realty Income Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Realty Income Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 11, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We believe we have qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT. Under the REIT operating structure, we are permitted to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in determining our taxable income. Assuming our dividends equal or exceed our taxable net income, we generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on such income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, except for the federal income taxes of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The income taxes recorded on our consolidated statements of income represent amounts paid by Realty Income for city and state income and franchise taxes.

Earnings and profits that determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in the estimated useful lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis) of the investments in properties for tax purposes, among other things.

We regularly analyze our various federal and state filing positions and only recognize the income tax effect in our financial statements when certain criteria regarding uncertain income tax positions have been met. We believe that our income tax positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination by all relevant taxing authorities. Therefore, no provisions for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded in our financial statements.

Net Income per Common Share.

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders, plus income attributable to dilutive shares and convertible common units, for the period by the weighted average number of common shares that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share computation.

Discontinued Operations.

During the first quarter of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that changed the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results.  We early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014.

Starting with the first quarter of 2014, the results of operations for all qualifying disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income.  Prior to the date of adoption of

Accounting Standards Update 2014-08 (ASU 2014-08), which amends Topic 205,

Presentation of Financial Statements

, and Topic 360,

Property, Plant, and Equipment

, we reported, in discontinued operations, the results of operations of properties that had either been disposed of or classified as held for sale in financial statements issued.

Operations from ten properties were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015, and are included in income from continuing operations.  We do not depreciate properties that are classified as held for sale.

If the property was previously reclassified as held for sale but the applicable criteria for this classification are no longer met, the property is reclassified to real estate held for investment. A property that is reclassified to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment, or (ii) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.

No debt was assumed by buyers of our properties, or repaid as a result of our property sales.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $2.8 million, or $0.01 per common share, basic and diluted. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $65.7 million, or $0.34 per common share, basic and diluted.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

. All leases are accounted for as operating leases. Under this method, leases that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any rental revenue contingent upon a tenant’s sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indexes are recognized only after the changes in the indexes have occurred and are then applied according to the lease agreements.  Contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses are included in tenant reimbursements in the period when such costs are incurred.

-


-


We recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible. We consider tenant specific issues, such as financial stability and ability to pay, when determining collectability of accounts receivable and appropriate allowances to record. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $429,000 at December 31, 2015 and $765,000 at December 31, 2014.

Other revenue, which comprises property-related revenue not included in rental revenue or tenant reimbursements, was $4.4 million in 2015, $2.9 million in 2014 and $7.0 million in 2013.

Principles of Consolidation

. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Realty Income and other entities for which we make operating and financial decisions (i.e. control), after elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions. We consolidate entities that we control and record a noncontrolling interest for the portion that we do not own.  Noncontrolling interest that was created or assumed as part of a business combination was recognized at fair value as of the date of the transaction (see note 11).  We have no unconsolidated investments.

Cash Equivalents

. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily investments in United States government money market funds.

Gain on Sales of Properties

. When real estate is sold, the related net book value of the applicable assets is removed and a gain from the sale is recognized in our consolidated statements of income. We record a gain from the sale of real estate provided that various criteria, relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by us with the real estate, have been met.

Allocation of the Purchase Price of Real Estate Acquisitions

. When acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and tenant relationships, as applicable.  In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties.  The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located.  In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, tenant investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets.  The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.  Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which does not exceed one year.  The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.

Our estimated fair value determinations are based on management’s judgment, utilizing various factors, including: (1) market conditions, (2) industry that the tenant operates in, (3) characteristics of the real estate, i.e.: location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, (4) tenant credit profile, (5) store profitability and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant’s business, and/or (6) real estate valuations, prepared either internally or by an independent valuation firm.  Our methodologies for measuring fair value related to the allocation of the purchase price of real estate acquisitions include both observable market data (and thus should be categorized as level 2 on FASB’s three-level valuation hierarchy) and unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions and calculations (and thus should be categorized as level 3 on FASB’s three-level valuation hierarchy).

The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease (which includes land and buildings/improvements) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the “as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land and buildings/improvements based on our determination of the fair value of these assets. Our fair value determinations are based on a real estate valuation for each property, prepared either internally or by an independent valuation firm, and consider estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases. In allocating the fair value to identified intangibles for above-market or below-market leases, an amount is recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining term of the lease.

-


-


The values of the above-market and below-market leases are amortized over the term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal options, as an adjustment to rental revenue on our consolidated statements of income.

The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consists of the fair value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, as applicable. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.

If a lease was terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate.

In allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above or below-market interest rates.  Our assumed net debt premiums are amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.

In allocating noncontrolling interests, amounts are recorded based on the fair value of units issued at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement.

Depreciation and Amortization

. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded and stated at cost. Major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Buildings and improvements that are under redevelopment, or are being developed, are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets. Additionally, amounts essential to the development of the property, such as pre-construction, development, construction, interest and other costs incurred during the period of development are capitalized. We cease capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in any event no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity.

Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Provision for Impairment.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. Key factors that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, historical sales and releases, capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates. If a property is classified as held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell, and depreciation of the property ceases.

In 2015, we recorded total provisions for impairment of $10.6 million on three properties classified as held for sale, four properties classified as held for investment, seven sold properties, and one property disposed of other than by sale in the following industries: one in the convenience stores industry, one in the health and fitness industry, one in the pet supplies and services industry, eleven in the restaurant-casual dining industry, and one among the industry we classify as “other.”  These properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of ASU 2014-08; accordingly, the provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.

-


-


In 2014, Realty Income recorded total provisions for impairment of $4.6 million.  Provisions for impairment of $4.1 million are included in income from continuing operations on nine sold properties and two properties classified as held for investment in the following industries: one in the consumer electronics industry, one in the convenience stores industry, one in the home furnishings industry, two in the home improvement industry, and six in the restaurant-casual dining industry. These properties were not previously classified as held for sale in financial statements issued prior to the date of adoption of ASU 2014-08; accordingly, these provisions for impairment are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income.  Additionally during 2014, a provision for impairment of $510,000 is included in income from discontinued operations on one sold property in the grocery store industry that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013.

In 2013, Realty Income recorded total provisions for impairment of $3.0 million.  Realty Income recorded provisions for impairment of $2.7 million in income from discontinued operations on seven sold properties in the following industries: one in the automotive parts industry, two in the child care industry, one in the grocery store industry, one in the pet supplies and services industry, and two in the restaurant casual dining industry.  Except for a provision for impairment of $290,000 that was recorded in income from continuing operations for one property in the auto service industry that was not previously classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013, the remaining provisions for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income.

In 2013, Crest also recorded a provision for impairment of $308,000 on one sold property in the restaurant-casual dining industry, which is included in income from discontinued operations.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

We analyze our future legal obligations associated with the other-than-temporary removal of tangible long-lived assets, also referred to as asset retirement obligations. When we determine that we have a legal obligation to provide services upon the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset, we record a liability for this obligation based on the estimated fair value of this obligation and adjust the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. This asset is amortized over its estimated useful life. The estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation is calculated by discounting the future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.

Goodwill

. Goodwill is tested for impairment during the second quarter of each year as well as when events or circumstances occur indicating that our goodwill might be impaired.  Under the amendments issued in conjunction with

ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)

, an entity, through an assessment of qualitative factors, is not required to calculate the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, in connection with the two-step goodwill impairment test, unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.  We elected to continue testing goodwill for impairment during the second quarter of each year as well as when events or circumstances occur, indicating that our goodwill might be impaired.  During our tests for impairment of goodwill during the second quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.  We did not record any impairment on our existing goodwill during 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Equity Offering Costs.

Underwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital on our consolidated balance sheets.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling interests are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of equity.  Noncontrolling interests are recorded initially at fair value based on the price of the applicable units issued, and subsequently adjusted each period for distributions, contributions and the allocation of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests.

As consideration for two separate acquisitions during 2013, partnership units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P. and Realty Income, L.P. were issued to third parties.  These common units (discussed in footnote 11) do not have voting rights, are entitled to monthly distributions equal to the amount paid to our common stockholders, and are redeemable in cash or our common stock, at our option and at a conversion ratio of one to one, subject to certain exceptions.  As the general partner for each of these partnerships, we have operating and financial control over these entities, consolidate them in our financial statements, and record the partnership units held by third parties as noncontrolling interests.

-


-


Use of Estimates

. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

. In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2015-03, which amends Topic 835,

Other Presentation Matters

. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs be reported on the balance sheet as a direct reduction of the face amount of the debt instrument they relate to, and should not be classified as a deferred charge, as was previously required under the Accounting Standards Codification.  ASU 2015-03 is effective, on a retrospective basis, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015; early adoption is permitted.  We have not yet adopted this ASU and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, FASB, issued ASU 2015-16, which amends Topic 805,

Business Combinations

. The amendments in this ASU require that we recognize purchase price allocation adjustments that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, and eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments.  ASU 2015-16 is effective, on a prospective basis, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015; early adoption is permitted.  We early adopted this ASU 2015-16 during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Investments in Real Estate

We acquire land, buildings and improvements necessary for the successful operations of commercial tenants.

A.

Acquisitions during 2015 and 2014

During 2015, we invested $1.26 billion in 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 6.6%. The 286 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states, will contain approximately 6.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 21 industries and the property types consist of 87.3% retail and 12.7% industrial, based on rental revenue.  None of our investments during 2015 caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at December 31, 2015.

The $1.26 billion invested during 2015 was allocated as follows: $257.1 million to land, $937.1 million to buildings and improvements, $105.8 million to intangible assets related to leases, and $40.9 million to intangible liabilities related to leases and other assumed liabilities. There was no contingent consideration associated with these acquisitions.

The properties acquired during 2015 generated total revenues of $43.4 million and income from continuing operations of $21.1 million.

Of the $1.26 billion we invested during 2015, $195.4 million of the purchase price allocation is based on a preliminary measurement of fair value that is subject to change.  The allocation for these properties represents our current best estimate of fair value, and we expect to finalize the valuations and complete the purchase price allocations in 2016. During 2015, we finalized the purchase price allocations for $147.1 million invested in the fourth quarter of 2014.  There were no material changes to our consolidated balance sheets or income statements as a result of these purchase price allocations being finalized.

In comparison, during 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.1%. The 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 42 states, contain approximately 9.8 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries and the property types consist of 85.7% retail, 6.6% industrial, 6.4% office, and 1.3% manufacturing, based on rental revenue.

-


-


The $1.4 billion invested during 2014 was allocated as follows: $295.6 million to land, $984.1 million to buildings and improvements, $209.4 million to intangible assets related to leases, $901,000 to other assets, net, and $87.4 million to intangible liabilities related to leases and other assumed liabilities.  We also recorded mortgage premiums of $604,000 associated with the mortgages acquired.  There was no contingent consideration associated with these acquisitions.

The properties acquired during 2014 generated total revenues of $75.1 million and income from continuing operations of $27.8 million for year ended December 31, 2014.

The estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. Of the $1.26 billion we invested during 2015, $45.8 million was invested in 35 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.7%. Of the $1.4 billion we invested during 2014, $81.9 million was invested in 40 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.4%.

B.

Acquisition Transaction Costs

Acquisition transaction costs of $913,000 and $453,000 were recorded to general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of income during 2015 and 2014, respectively.

C.

Investments in Existing Properties

During 2015, we capitalized costs of $11.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $748,000 for re-leasing costs, $7.6 million for recurring capital expenditures and $3.2 million for non-recurring building improvements.  In comparison, during 2014, we capitalized costs of $6.0 million on existing properties in our portfolio.

D.

Properties with Existing Leases

Of the $1.26 billion we invested during 2015, approximately $391.4 million was used to acquire 86 properties with existing leases.  In comparison, of the $1.4 billion we invested during 2014, approximately $957.4 million was used to acquire 201 properties with existing leases. The value of the in-place and above-market leases is recorded to acquired lease intangible assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets, and the value of the below-market leases is recorded to acquired lease intangible liabilities, net on our consolidated balance sheets.

The values of the in-place leases are amortized as depreciation and amortization expense.  The amounts amortized to expense for all of our in-place leases, for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $87.9 million, $83.6 million, and $65.5 million, respectively.

The values of the above-market and below-market leases are amortized over the term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal options, as an adjustment to rental revenue on our consolidated statements of income. The amounts amortized as a net decrease to rental revenue for capitalized above-market and below-market leases for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $7.9 million, $8.0 million, and $8.2 million, respectively.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate.

-


-


The following table presents the estimated impact during the next five years and thereafter related to the amortization of the acquired above-market and below-market lease intangibles and the

amortization of the in-place lease intangibles for properties held for investment at December 31, 2015 (in

thousands):

5.

Credit Facility

In June 2015, we entered into a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or our new credit facility, which replaced our $1.5 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2016. The initial term of our new credit facility expires in June 2019 and includes, at our option, two six-month extensions. Our new credit facility has a $1.0 billion accordion expansion option.  Under our new credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 0.90% with a facility commitment fee of 0.15%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.05% over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor. We also have other interest rate options available to us under our new credit facility. Our new credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.

At December 31, 2015, credit facility origination costs of $10.2 million are included in other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheet.  This balance includes $9.1 million of new credit facility origination costs incurred during 2015 as a result of entering into our new credit facility. These costs, as well as a portion of the costs incurred as a result of entering into our previous credit facilities, are being amortized over the remaining term of our new credit facility.

At December 31, 2015, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.76 billion available on our new credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $238.0 million, as compared to an outstanding balance of $223.0 million at December 31, 2014.

The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities was 1.2% during 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2015, the effective interest rate was 1.2%.  Our new and previous credit facilities are and were subject to various leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations, and at December 31, 2015, we remain in compliance with the covenants on our new credit facility.

6.

Mortgages Payable

During 2015, we made $198.4 million in principal payments, including the repayment of 13 mortgages in full for $191.0 million.  No mortgages were assumed during 2015.

During 2014, we made $85.2 million in principal payments, including the repayment of six mortgages in full for $77.8 million.  Additionally, during 2014 we assumed mortgages totaling $166.7 million, excluding net premiums.  The mortgages are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed.  We expect to pay off the mortgages as soon as prepayment penalties make it economically feasible to do so.

During 2014, aggregate net premiums totaling $604,000 were recorded upon assumption of the mortgages for above-market interest rates. Amortization of our net premiums is recorded as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages, using a method that approximates the effective-interest method.

-


-


These mortgages contain customary covenants, such as limiting our ability to further mortgage each applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage without the prior consent of the lender. At

December 31, 2015

, we remain in compliance with these covenants.

We did not incur any deferred financing costs on our mortgages assumed in 2014. The balance of our deferred financing costs, which are classified as part of other assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets, was $553,000 at December 31, 2015 and $827,000 at December 31, 2014. These costs are being amortized over the remaining term of each mortgage.

The following is a summary of all our mortgages payable as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands):

At December 31, 2015, there were 44 mortgages on 183 properties, while at December 31, 2014, there were 57 mortgages on 241 properties.  The mortgages require monthly payments, with principal payments due at maturity.  The mortgages are at fixed interest rates, except for four mortgages on 13 properties totaling $51.1 million at December 31, 2015, including net unamortized discounts.  At December 31, 2014, five mortgages on 14 properties totaling $74.5 million, including net unamortized discounts, were at variable interest rates.  After factoring in arrangements which limit our exposure to interest rate risk and effectively fix our per annum interest rates, our variable rate mortgage debt includes two mortgages totaling $15.5 million at December 31, 2015, and three mortgages totaling

$39.1 million at December 31, 2014.

Term Loans

In June 2015, in conjunction with entering into our new credit facility, we entered into a $250 million senior unsecured term loan maturing on June 30, 2020.  Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one month LIBOR, plus 0.95%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.67%.

In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing January 21, 2018.  Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one month LIBOR, plus 1.2%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.15%.

Deferred financing costs of $1.2 million incurred in conjunction with the $250 million term loan and $303,000 incurred in conjunction with the $70 million term loan are being amortized over the remaining terms of each term loan.  The net balance of these deferred financing costs, which was $1.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $187,000 at December 31, 2014, is included in other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets.

Notes Payable

A.

General

Our senior unsecured notes and bonds consisted of the following, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):

The following table summarizes the maturity of our notes and bonds payable as of December 31, 2015, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts (dollars in millions):

As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on our notes and bonds payable was 4.7% and the weighted average remaining years until maturity was 6.5 years.

Interest incurred on all of the notes and bonds was $179.5 million for 2015, $166.5 million for 2014 and $138.9 million for 2013. The interest rate on each of these notes and bonds is fixed.

Our outstanding notes and bonds are unsecured; accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these or any other obligations. Interest on all of the senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.

All of these notes and bonds contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. At December 31, 2015, we remain in compliance with these covenants.

B.

Note Issuances

In September 2014, we issued $250 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due October 2026, or the 2026 Notes.  The price to the investors for the 2026 Notes was 99.499% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4.178% per annum.  A portion of the total net proceeds of approximately $246.4 million from this offering were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes, including additional property acquisitions.

-


-


In June 2014, we issued $350 million of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due July 2024, or the 2024 Notes.  The price to the investors for the 2024 Notes was 99.956% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 3.88% per annum.  The total net proceeds of approximately $346.7 million from these offerings were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our previous credit facility.

C.     Note Repayment

In November 2015, we repaid $150 million of outstanding 5.5% notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, using proceeds from our October 2015 common stock offering and our new credit facility.

9.   Redemption of Preferred Stock

In September 2014, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption for all 8.8 million shares of our 6.75% Monthly Income Class E Preferred Stock for $25 per share, plus accrued dividends.  The redemption occurred in October 2014.  We incurred a charge of $6.0 million, representing the Class E preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2006.

10.     Issuance of Common Stock

In October 2015, we issued 11,500,000 shares of common stock, including 1,500,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.0 million, a portion of the net proceeds of $517.1 million was used to repay borrowings under our new credit facility and the remaining portion was used for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

In April 2015, we issued 5,500,000 shares of common stock.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $1.4 million, the net proceeds of $276.4 million were used to repay borrowings under our previous $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility.

In April 2014, we issued 13,800,000 shares of common stock, including 1,800,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.8 million, the net proceeds of $528.6 million were used to repay borrowings under our previous credit facility.

11.     Noncontrolling Interests

In January 2013, we completed our acquisition of ARCT.  We issued a total of 45,573,144 shares of our common stock to ARCT shareholders and we received 208,709 shares of our common stock that were previously held by ARCT.  The total value of the 45,573,144 common shares was approximately $2 billion.

Equity issued as consideration for this transaction included common and preferred partnership units issued by Tau Operating Partnership, L.P., or Tau Operating Partnership, the consolidated subsidiary which owns properties acquired through the ARCT acquisition.  Realty Income and its subsidiaries hold a 99.4% interest in Tau Operating Partnership, and consolidate the entity.

In June 2013, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of properties by issuing common partnership units in a newly formed entity, Realty Income, L.P.  The units were issued as consideration for the acquisition.  At December 31, 2015, the remaining units from this issuance represent a 1.4% ownership in Realty Income, L.P.  Realty Income holds the remaining 98.6% interests in this entity and consolidates the entity.

A.

Neither of the common partnership units have voting rights. Both common partnership units are entitled to monthly distributions equal to the amount paid to common stockholders of Realty Income, and are redeemable in cash or Realty Income common stock, at our option, and at a conversion ratio of one to one, subject to certain exceptions.  Noncontrolling interests with redemption provisions that permit the issuer to settle in either cash or common stock, at the option of the issuer, were evaluated to determine whether temporary or permanent equity classification on the balance sheet was appropriate.  We determined that the units meet the requirements to qualify for presentation as permanent equity.

-


-


The following table represents the change in the carrying value of all noncontrolling interests through December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

317,022 Tau Operating Partnership units were issued on January 22, 2013 and remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

(2)

534,546 Realty Income, L.P. units were issued on June 27, 2013, 499,546 units were outstanding as of December 31, 2014, an

d 331,364 r

emain outstanding as of December 31, 2015.

During 2015 and 2014, we recorded net equity reclassification adjustments of $1.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively, between noncontrolling interests and additional paid in capital to adjust the carrying value of noncontrolling interests to be in-line with their equity ownership interests in the entities.

B.

The Tau Operating Partnership preferred units were recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition.  Since they were redeemable at a fixed price on a determinable date, we initially classified them in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  Payments on these preferred units were made monthly at a rate of 2% per annum and were included in interest expense.  As of December 31, 2014, the preferred units had a carrying value of $6.75 million.  In January 2015, we redeemed all 6,750 Tau Operating Partnership preferred units for $1,000 per unit, plus accrued and unpaid distributions.

12.

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, dividends paid per share of $1.656252 were characterized as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. At December 31, 2015, a monthly dividend of $0.138021 per share was payable and was paid in January 2016.  We are current in our obligations to pay dividends on our Class F preferred stock.

13.

Operating Leases

A.      At December 31, 2015, we owned 4,538 properties in 49 states and Puerto Rico, plus an additional eight properties owned by Crest. Of the 4,538 properties, 4,519, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2015, 71 properties were available for lease or sale.

Substantially all leases are net leases where the tenant pays property taxes and assessments, maintains the interior and exterior of the building and leased premises, and carries insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire and extended coverage.

Rent based on a percentage of a tenants’ gross sales (percentage rents) was $4.5 million for 2015, $3.6 million for 2014 and $2.9 million for 2013.

At December 31, 2015, minimum future annual rents to be received on the operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in thousands):

B.      Major Tenants - No individual tenant’s rental revenue, including percentage rents, represented more than 10% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.

14.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate

During 2015, we sold 38 investment properties for $65.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $22.2 million.  The results of operations for these properties are presented within continuing operations.

During 2014, we sold 46 investment properties for $107.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $42.1 million.  Only the results of operations specifically related to the properties classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013 and sold during the year were reclassified as discontinued operations.

-


-


During 2013, we sold 75 investment properties for $134.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $64.7 million.  The results of operations for these properties were reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

During 2015, Crest did not sell any properties.  Crest sold one property for $820,000 and one property for $597,000 during 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Neither of these sales resulted in a gain. The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.

15.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The

disclosure for assets and liabilities measured at fair value requires allocation to a three-level valuation hierarchy. This valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Categorization within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

We believe that the carrying values reflected in our consolidated balance sheets reasonably approximate the fair values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, escrow deposits, loans receivable, line of credit payable, term loans and all other liabilities, due to their short-term nature or interest rates and terms that are consistent with market, except for our notes receivable issued in connection with property sales, mortgages payable and our senior notes and bonds payable, which are disclosed below (dollars in millions):

The estimated fair values of our notes receivable issued in connection with property sales and our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using an interest rate based upon the relevant Treasury yield curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread.  Because this methodology includes unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions and calculations, the measurement of estimated fair values related to our notes receivable and mortgages payable is categorized as level three on the three-level valuation hierarchy.

The estimated fair values of our senior notes and bonds payable are based upon indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. Because this methodology includes inputs that are less observable by the public and are not necessarily reflected in active markets, the measurement of the estimated fair values, related to our notes and bonds payable, is categorized as level two on the three-level valuation hierarchy.

We record interest rate swaps on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are based on valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each swap, using both observable and unobservable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.  Because this methodology uses observable and unobservable inputs, the measurement of interest rate swaps is categorized as level two on the three-level valuation hierarchy.

16.

Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

Cash paid for interest was $229.5 million in 2015, $207.3 million in 2014, and $166.1 million in 2013.

Accrued costs on properties under development resulted in an increase in buildings and improvements and accounts payable of $4.0 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

17.

Employee Benefit Plan

We have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our employees. Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to make contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 60% of their compensation, subject to limits under the Code. We match 50% of each of our employee’s salary deferrals up to the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. Our aggregate matching contributions each year have been immaterial to our results of operations.

18.

Common Stock Incentive Plan

In 2012, our Board of Directors adopted and stockholders approved the Realty Income Corporation 2012 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2012 Plan, to enable us to motivate, attract and retain the services of directors and employees considered essential to our long-term success. The 2012 Plan offers our directors and employees an opportunity to own stock in Realty Income or rights that will reflect our growth, development and financial success. Under the terms of the 2012 plan, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject to options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other awards, will be no more than 3,985,734 shares. The 2012 Plan has a term of ten years from the date it was adopted by our Board of Directors.

The amount of share-based compensation costs recognized in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of income was $10.4 million during 2015, $12.0 million during 2014, and $20.8 million during 2013.

A.   Restricted Stock

-


-


The following table summarizes our common stock grant activity under our 2012 Plan. Our outstanding restricted stock vests over periods ranging from immediately to five years.

(1)

Grant date fair value.

During


, we issued

161,949

shares of common stock under the 2012 Plan. These shares generally vest over a five- year service period.  However, one grant of 4,964 shares vested immediately, and of the 28,000 shares which are granted annually to our Board of Directors, 12,000 shares vested immediately, 8,000 shares vest in one year following the grant (assuming continued service), and 8,000 shares vest over a three year service period.  Not included in the table above are 10,269 restricted stock units granted during


that vest over a five year service period and have the same economic rights as shares of restricted stock.

The vesting schedule for shares granted to non-employee directors is as follows:

-

For directors with less than six years of service at the date of grant, shares vest in 33.33% increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date the shares of stock are granted;

-

For directors with six years of service at the date of grant, shares vest in 50% increments on each of the first two anniversaries of the date the shares of stock are granted;

-

For directors with seven years of service at the date of grant, shares are 100% vested on the first anniversary of the date the shares of stock are granted; and

-

For directors with eight or more years of service at the date of grant, there is immediate vesting as of the date the shares of stock are granted.

For shares granted on or after January 1, 2015, shares granted to employees typically vest in 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. For shares granted prior to December 2014, the typical vesting schedule for shares granted to employees was as follows:

-

For employees age 55 and below at the grant date, shares vest in 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date;

-

For employees age 56 at the grant date, shares vest in 25% increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date;

-

For employees age 57 at the grant date, shares vest in 33.33% increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date;

-

For employees age 58 at the grant date, shares vest in 50% increments on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date;

-

For employees age 59 at the grant date, shares are 100% vested on the first anniversary of the grant date; and

-

For employees age 60 and above at the grant date, shares vest immediately on the grant date.

After being employed for six full months, all non-executive employees receive approximately 200 shares of restricted stock which vests over a five year period.  Additionally, depending on certain company performance metrics or attainment of individual achievements, non-executive employees may receive grants of restricted stock which vests over a five year period.

As of December 31, 2015, the remaining unamortized share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock totaled $13.9 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of each applicable award.

The amount of share-based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date. We define the grant date as the date the recipient and Realty Income have a mutual understanding of the key terms and condition of the award, and the recipient of the grant begins to benefit from, or be adversely affected by, subsequent changes in the price of the shares.

-


-


Due to a historically low turnover rate, we do not estimate a forfeiture rate for our nonvested shares. Accordingly, unexpected forfeitures will lower share-based compensation expense during the applicable period. Under the terms of our 2012 Plan, we pay non-refundable dividends to the holders of our nonvested shares. Applicable accounting guidance requires that the dividends paid to holders of these nonvested shares be charged as compensation expense to the extent that they relate to nonvested shares that do not or are not expected to vest. However, since we do not estimate forfeitures given our historical trends, we did not record any compensation expense related to dividends paid in


,


, or 2013.

As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no common stock options outstanding for any of the periods presented.

B.

Performance Shares

During 2015 and 2014, we granted performance share awards, as well as dividend equivalent rights, to our executive officers.  The number of performance shares that vest is based on the achievement of the following performance goals:

The performance shares are earned based on our performance, and vest 50% on the first and second January 1 after the end of the three year performance period, subject to continued service. The performance period for the 2014 performance awards began on January 1, 2014 and will end on December 31, 2016. The performance period for the 2015 performance awards began on January 1, 2015 and will end on December 31, 2017.

The fair value of the performance shares was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The following table summarizes our performance share grant activity:

As of December 31, 2015, the remaining share-based compensation expense related to the performance shares totaled $3.2 million.  The portion related to the market-based awards is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, and the portion related to the performance-based awards is being recognized on a tranche-by-tranche basis over the service period.

19.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, or the DRSPP, provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions. The DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions. The DRSPP authorizes up to 26,000,000 common shares to be issued.  During 2015, we issued 7,608,354 shares and raised approximately $363.0 million under the DRSPP.  During 2014, we issued 3,527,166 shares and raised approximately $158.5 million under the DRSPP.  During 2013, we issued 1,449,139 shares and raised approximately $55.6 million under the DRSPP. From the inception of the DRSPP through December 31, 2015, we have issued 12,699,862 shares and raised approximately $581.6 million.

In 2013, we revised our DRSPP so that we would pay for a majority of the plan-related fees, which were previously paid by investors, and to institute a waiver approval process, allowing larger investors or institutions, per a formal approval process, to purchase shares at a small discount, if approved by us. During 2015, we issued 7,413,207 shares and raised $353.7 million under the waiver approval process. In 2014, we issued 3,330,556 shares and raised $150.0 million under the waiver approval process.  In 2013, we issued 1,308,490 shares and raised $50.0 million under the waiver approval process.  These shares are included in the total activity noted in the preceding paragraph.

20.

At-the-Market (ATM) Program

In September 2015, we established an “at the market” equity distribution

program, or our ATM program, pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 12,000,000 shares of common stock to, or through a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  During 2015, we issued 714,301 shares and raised approximately $36.3 million under the ATM program.

21.

Segment Information

We evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by industry basis. For financial reporting purposes, we have grouped our tenants into 48 activity segments. All of the properties are incorporated into one of the applicable segments. Because almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating expenses, rental revenue is the only component of segment profit and loss we measure.

-


-


The following tables set forth certain information regarding the properties owned by us, classified according to the business of the respective tenants (dollars in thousands):

22.

Commitments and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of business, we are party to various legal actions which we believe are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. We believe that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

At December 31, 2015, we had commitments of $714,000 for re-leasing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and non-recurring building improvements. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had committed

$70.6 million under construction contracts, which is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.

We have certain properties that are subject to ground leases which are accounted for as operating leases.  At December 31, 2015, minimum future rental payments for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in millions):

(1)

Realty Income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases.

(2)

Our tenants, who are generally sub-tenants under the ground leases, are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases.  In the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily responsible.

23.

Subsequent Events

In January 2016 and February 2016, we declared the following dividends, which will be paid in February 2016 and March 2016, respectively:

·

$0.1985 per share to our common stockholders and

-


-


·

$0.138021 per share to our Class F preferred stockholders.

During January and February of 2016, we repaid five mortgages in full for $129.6 million.

CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

(not covered by Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm)

(1)

The consolidated quarterly financial data includes revenues and expenses from our continuing and discontinued operations.  The results of operations related to certain properties, classified as held for sale or disposed of, have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations.  Additionally, tenant reimbursements have been reported as a component of total revenue and reimbursable property expense have been reported as a component of total expenses.  Therefore, some of the information may not agree to our previously filed 10-Qs.

Item 9:

Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial

Disclosure

We have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that

information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer

. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.

Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013)” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.  KPMG LLP has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to material affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  As of December 31, 2015, there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls, and therefore, no corrective actions were taken.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
