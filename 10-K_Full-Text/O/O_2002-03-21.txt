PART I

ITEM 1: BUSINESS
                                   THE COMPANY

Realty  Income   Corporation,   "The  Monthly  Dividend   Company,"  a  Maryland
corporation  ("Realty  Income," the "Company," "us," "our" or "we") is organized
to operate as an equity real estate  investment  trust ("REIT").  We are a fully
integrated,  self-administered  real estate  company with in-house  acquisition,
leasing,  legal,  retail and real  estate  research,  portfolio  management  and
capital markets expertise.

Our primary business objective is to generate  dependable monthly dividends from
a consistent and predictable  level of funds from operations  ("FFO") per share.
Additionally,  we seek to increase  distributions  to  stockholders  and FFO per
share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional
properties.

Our portfolio management focus includes:

o  Contractual rent increases on existing leases;
o  Rent increases at the termination of existing  leases when market  conditions
   permit;  and
o  The active management of our property portfolio, including selective sales of
   properties.

Our  acquisition  of  additional  properties  adheres to a focused  strategy  of
acquiring primarily:

o  Freestanding, single-tenant, retail properties;
o  Properties leased to regional and national retail chains; and
o  Properties under long-term, net-lease agreements.

At December 31, 2001, we owned a diversified portfolio:

o  Of 1,124 retail properties;
o  With an occupancy rate of 98.2%, or 1,104 of the 1,124 properties;
o  Leased to 78 different retail chains;
o  Doing business in 24 separate retail industries;
o  Located in 48 states; and
o  With over 9.6 million square feet of leasable space.

Of the 1,124  properties in the portfolio,  1,119, or 99.6%,  are  single-tenant
retail properties with the remaining five being multi-tenant  properties.  As of
December 31, 2001, 1,099, or 98.2%, of the 1,119  single-tenant  properties were
leased  with an  weighted  average  remaining  lease term  (excluding  extension
options) of approximately 10.4 years.

We typically  acquire,  then lease back, retail store locations from chain store
operators,  providing capital to the operators for continued expansion and other
corporate purposes.  Our acquisitions and investment activities are concentrated
in well-defined  target markets and focus generally on  middle-market  retailers
providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs.

Our net-lease agreements generally:

o  Are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;
o  Require  the  tenant to pay a minimum  monthly  rent and  property  operating
   expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and
o  Provide for future rent increases  (typically  subject to ceilings)  based on
   increases in the consumer price index,  fixed  increases,  or additional rent
   calculated  as a  percentage  of the  tenants'  gross sales above a specified
   level.





Realty  Income  commenced  operations  as a REIT on August 15, 1994  through the
merger of 25 public and private real estate limited  partnerships  with and into
the Company.  Each of the  partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the
purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased properties.

The five senior officers of the Company owned 0.8% of the Company's  outstanding
common stock with a market value of $8.6 million at March 1, 2002. The directors
and five senior officers of the Company, as a group, owned 2.5% of the Company's
outstanding common stock with a market value of $26.5 million at March 1, 2002.

Realty Income's  common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange  ("NYSE")
under the ticker symbol "O." Our central index key ("CIK")  number is 726728 and
cusip number is 756109-104.

Realty Income's Class B cumulative  redeemable  preferred stock is listed on the
NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprB" and its cusip number is 756109-302.

Realty Income's Class C cumulative  redeemable  preferred stock is listed on the
NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprC" and its cusip number is 756109-500.

Realty  Income's 8.25% Monthly  Income Senior Notes,  due 2008 are listed on the
NYSE  under  the  ticker  symbol  "OUI."  The  cusip  number  of these  notes is
756109-203.

Realty Income had 53 employees as of March 1, 2002.


                              RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

ISSUANCE OF COMMON  STOCK.  In May 2001,  we issued  2,850,000  shares of common
stock at a price of $27.80 per share. We issued an additional  100,000 shares in
May 2001 when the underwriters  exercised their  over-allotment  option. The net
proceeds of $77.5 million were used to repay  borrowings  under our $200 million
acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.

In October 2001, we issued 2,600,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50
per share.  We issued an  additional  350,000  shares in November  2001 when the
underwriters  exercised their  over-allotment  option. The net proceeds of $79.5
million were used to repay borrowings under our $200 million  acquisition credit
facility.

In February 2002, we issued 273,150 shares of common stock to a unit  investment
trust at a net price to us of $30.26 per share,  based on a 5%  discount  to the
market  price at the time of issuance of $31.85 per share.  The net  proceeds of
$8.2 million were used to repay bank borrowings.


PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. In 2001, we acquired 91 properties (the "New Properties")
located in 25 states.  In 2001, we invested $131.8 million in the New Properties
and properties under development, excluding estimated unfunded development costs
at December 31, 2001 of $3.1 million.

The initial  weighted  average annual  unleveraged  return on the $131.8 million
invested in 2001 is estimated to be 11.0%, computed as estimated contractual net
operating  income  (which in the case of a  net-leased  property is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of properties under  construction,  the estimated base
rent under the lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated
total costs.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual  rent,  we cannot  assure  you that the  actual  return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above.





The New Properties will contain  approximately  877,200 leasable square feet and
are 100% leased  under net leases,  with an average  initial  lease term of 20.1
years.  As of December 31, 2001, two of the New Properties were leased and under
construction,  pursuant to contracts  under which the tenants  agreed to develop
the properties  (with  development  costs funded by Realty Income) and with rent
scheduled to begin in the first half of 2002.

CREST NET LEASE. We created Crest Net Lease,  Inc. ("Crest Net") in January 2000
to buy,  own  and  sell  properties,  primarily  to  buyers  using  tax-deferred
exchanges  under  Section 1031 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code").  In order to comply with the REIT  qualification  requirements  in
force when we  created  Crest Net,  5% of the common  stock of Crest Net,  which
represented  100% of the voting stock,  was not owned by the Company.  Effective
for 2001,  the Code was modified to allow a REIT to own up to 100% of the voting
stock and/or value of a  corporation  that elects with the REIT and qualifies to
be  treated  as a taxable  REIT  subsidiary.  Following  the change in the Code,
Realty Income and Crest Net jointly elected to treat Crest Net as a taxable REIT
subsidiary,  effective  January 1, 2001,  and in May 2001 we acquired  the 5% of
Crest Net's  common  stock owned by certain  members of our  management  and the
management of Crest Net for $507,000.  The acquisition of the 5% of common stock
was accounted for under the purchase  method of  accounting.  The  disinterested
members  of  our  Board  of  Directors  approved  this  transaction.  Crest  Net
originally issued this stock for $450,000. Realty Income also received rights to
the  undistributed  earnings on the stock,  which  totaled  $81,200.  After this
transaction, Realty Income owns 100% of Crest Net's stock.

The financial  statements  of Crest Net are  consolidated  into Realty  Income's
financial  statements.   All  material   intercompany   transactions  have  been
eliminated in consolidation.

In 2001,  Crest Net invested  $24.7 million in 26 retail  properties.  Estimated
unfunded  development costs on two properties under construction at December 31,
2001 totaled  $2.8  million.  These 26  properties  will  contain  approximately
102,300 of leasable  square feet,  are 100% leased and have initial  lease terms
averaging 20.1 years. Three of these properties were sold in 2001.

In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties for $28.9 million and we recorded a gain
of $3.4 million  before income taxes.  At the end of 2001,  Crest Net carried an
inventory  of $22.3  million,  which is included in real estate held for sale on
our  consolidated  balance sheet. In addition to our real estate  portfolio,  at
December 31, 2001, Crest Net's portfolio consisted of 24 retail properties:

o  Located in 14 states;
o  That will contain approximately 92,300 square feet of leasable space; and
o  That are 100% leased and are held for sale.


FUNDS FROM  OPERATIONS  (FFO).  In 2001, our FFO increased by $10.6 million,  or
15.8%,  to $77.8 million versus $67.2 million in 2000. See our discussion of FFO
in the section  entitled  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" in this annual report.

In 2001,  Crest Net generated $2.4 million in FFO for Realty Income.  The future
contribution,  if any, to our FFO by Crest Net will depend on the timing and the
number of property sales it achieves, if any, in any given year.


SALES OF INVESTMENT  PROPERTIES.  In 2001, we sold 35 properties  for a total of
$39.5 million and recognized a gain of $10.5 million.

We have an active  portfolio  management  program that  incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe  the  reinvestment  of the sale  proceeds  will  generate
higher  returns,  enhance  the credit  quality of our real estate  portfolio  or
extend our average  remaining  lease term.  At December 31, 2001,  we classified
real  estate  with a carrying  amount of $23.4  million as held for sale,  which
includes  $22.3  million  in  properties  owned by Crest Net.  Additionally,  we
anticipate  selling  properties  from  our  portfolio  that  have  not yet  been
specifically  identified.  We  anticipate  we will  receive up to $50 million in
proceeds  from the sale of  properties  during the next 12 months.  We intend to
invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions.





INCREASES  IN MONTHLY  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO COMMON  STOCKHOLDERS.  We continue  our
33-year  policy of  paying  distributions  monthly.  In the past 12  months,  we
increased  monthly   distributions  per  share  by  $0.00125  on  four  separate
occasions. In April 2001 the increase per share was to $0.18625, in July 2001 to
$0.1875,  in October 2001 to $0.18875 and in January 2002 to $0.19. The increase
in January was our 17th consecutive  quarterly  increase and 19th increase since
1995.  In 2001,  we paid three  monthly  distributions  per share of each of the
following amounts; $0.185; $0.18625; $0.1875 and $0.18875,  totaling $2.2425. In
December  2001,  January 2002 and February  2002, we declared  distributions  of
$0.19 per share,  which were paid on January  15,  2002,  February  15, 2002 and
March  15,  2002,  respectively.  The  monthly  distribution  of $0.19 per share
represents  a  current  annualized  distribution  of  $2.28  per  share,  and an
annualized  distribution  yield of approximately 7.3% based on the last reported
sale price of the Company's Common Stock on the NYSE of $31.40 on March 1, 2002.
Although we expect to continue our policy of paying  monthly  distributions,  we
cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of distributions,  that
we will continue our pattern of increasing  distributions per share, or what the
actual distribution yield will be for any future period.


UNSECURED  REVOLVING  CREDIT  FACILITIES.  We  have  a $200  million  revolving,
unsecured  acquisition  credit  facility that expires in December  2003. We also
have a $25 million,  three-year,  revolving  unsecured  credit  facility,  which
expires in February 2003. These credit  facilities have been and are expected to
be used for the acquisition of properties and to provide capital to subsidiaries
for the purpose of acquiring properties.


STOCK AND SENIOR DEBT PURCHASE PROGRAM.  In January 2000, our Board of Directors
authorized  the  purchase  of up to $10  million of our  outstanding  common and
preferred shares and senior debt securities.  In 2001, we purchased 6,800 shares
of our  common  stock at an  average  price of  $24.82  per  share,  for a total
investment of $169,000. The purchases were funded from operating cash flow. From
January 2000 through December 2001, we purchased an aggregate of $6.7 million of
our securities.


                               DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Distributions  are  paid  to our  common  stockholders  and  Class  C  Preferred
stockholders  on a  monthly  basis  and  are  paid  to  our  Class  B  Preferred
stockholders  on a  quarterly  basis  if, as and when  declared  by our Board of
Directors.  The Class B Preferred stockholders receive cumulative  distributions
at a rate of  9.375%  per  annum  on the $25 per  share  liquidation  preference
(equivalent to $2.34375 per annum per share). The Class C Preferred stockholders
receive  cumulative  distributions  at a rate of 9.5%  per  annum on the $25 per
share liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.3750 per annum per share).

In order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal  income tax  purposes,
we  generally  are  required  to  distribute   dividends  to  our   stockholders
aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without
regard to the dividends  paid  deduction and by excluding net capital gains) and
we are subject to income test to the extent we distribute  less than 100% of our
REIT  taxable  income   (including  net  capital  gains).  In  2001,  our  total
distributions totaled approximately 114.5% of our estimated REIT taxable income.
We  intend  to  continue  to make  distributions  to our  stockholders  that are
sufficient  to meet  this  distribution  requirement  and that will  reduce  our
exposure to income taxes.

Future  distributions  by us will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors
and will depend on, among other  things,  our results of  operations,  financial
condition and capital requirements,  the annual distribution  requirements under
the REIT provisions of the Code, our debt service requirements and other factors
as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition,  our credit facilities
contain  financial  covenants  which  could  limit the  amount of  distributions
payable by us in the event of a  deterioration  in our results of  operations or
financial  condition,  and which  prohibit the payment of  distributions  on the
common or preferred  stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to
any applicable  grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings  under our
credit facilities.




Distributions  by us, to the extent of our current and accumulated  earnings and
profits  for  federal  income  tax  purposes,   generally  will  be  taxable  to
stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent we recognize capital gains
and declare a capital gains  dividend.  Distributions  in excess of earnings and
profits   generally   will  be  treated  as  a  non-taxable   reduction  in  the
stockholders'  basis in its stock to the extent of that basis, and thereafter as
a capital gain.  Approximately 13.1% of the distributions made or deemed to have
been made in 2001 to our  common  stockholders  were  classified  as a return of
capital for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict the portion of
2002 or future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital since
the amount depends on our taxable income for the entire year.


                        BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

INVESTMENT  PHILOSOPHY.  We believe that the long-term  ownership of an actively
managed,  diversified portfolio of retail properties under long-term,  net-lease
agreements produces consistent, predictable income. Under a net-lease agreement,
the tenant agrees to pay a minimum monthly rent and property  operating expenses
(taxes,  maintenance  and  insurance)  plus,  typically,  future rent  increases
(generally  subject to ceilings) based on increases in the consumer price index,
fixed  increases or additional  rent  calculated as a percentage of the tenant's
gross sales above a specified level. We believe that long-term  leases,  coupled
with the tenant's responsibility for property expenses, generally produce a more
predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while
continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.


INVESTMENT STRATEGY. In identifying new properties for acquisition,  we focus on
providing  expansion  capital to retail chains by acquiring,  then leasing back,
their retail store locations.  We classify retail tenants into three categories:
venture, middle market and upper market. Venture companies typically offer a new
retail concept in one geographic  region of the country and operate between five
and 50 retail  outlets.  Middle market retail  chains  typically  have 50 to 500
retail  outlets,  operations  in more  than one  geographic  region,  have  been
successful  through one or more economic cycles,  and have a proven,  replicable
concept.  The upper market retail chains typically consist of companies with 500
or more stores,  operating nationally in a proven, mature retail concept.  Upper
market retail chains  generally  have strong  operating  histories and access to
several sources of capital.

Realty Income primarily focuses on acquiring  properties leased to middle market
retail chains that we believe are attractive for investment because:

o  They generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles
   that tend to adversely affect venture retailers;
o  They  typically  require  capital  to fund  expansion  but have more  limited
   financing options;
o  They generally have provided us with  attractive  risk-adjusted  returns over
   time since their financial strength has, in many cases,  tended to improve as
   their businesses have matured;
o  Their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a
   greater number of stores; and
o  Middle  market  retailers  typically  have the critical  mass to survive if a
   number of locations are closed due to underperformance.





We also focus on and have  selectively  made  investments in properties of upper
market  retail  chains.  We believe upper market retail chains can be attractive
for investment because:

o  They typically are of a higher credit quality;
o  They are usually larger brand name, public and private retailers;
o  They utilize a larger  building  ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square
   feet; and
o  They  are  able  to  grow  because  access  to  capital   facilitates  larger
   transaction sizes.

While our investment  strategy focuses primarily on acquiring  properties leased
to middle and upper market retail chains,  we also  selectively seek incremental
investment  opportunities  with  venture  market  retail  chains.  Periodically,
venture  market  opportunities  arise where we feel that the real estate used by
the tenant is of high quality and can be purchased at prices that are  favorable
in the marketplace. To meet our stringent investment standards, however, venture
retail companies must have a well-defined retailing concept and strong financial
prospects.  These opportunities are examined on a case by case basis, and we are
highly selective in making investments in this area.

The  Internet  has  become  an  important   delivery  channel  for  many  retail
businesses,  and our investment strategy has positioned us to compete in such an
environment.  Historically,  our investment focus has been on retail  industries
that have a service  component  because we believe the lease  revenue from these
types of  businesses  is more  stable.  Because  of this  investment  focus,  at
December 31, 2001,  approximately 75% of our annualized  revenue is derived from
retailers  with  a  service  component  in  their  business.  We  believe  these
service-oriented  businesses  would be difficult to duplicate  over the Internet
and, as a result,  our property  portfolio  should be fairly well positioned for
competition from Internet businesses.


CREDIT STRATEGY.  We principally provide  sale-leaseback  financing primarily to
less than investment  grade retail chains.  From 1970 through December 31, 2001,
we have  acquired and leased back to regional and national  retail  chains 1,158
properties  (including  83  properties  that have been sold) and have  collected
approximately  98%  of  the  original  contractual  rent  obligations  on  those
properties.  We believe  that within  this  market we can achieve an  attractive
risk-adjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers.

We believe the primary financial obligations of most retailers typically include
their bank and other debt,  payment  obligations  to  suppliers  and real estate
lease  obligations.  Because we own the land and  buildings  on which the tenant
conducts its retail  business,  we believe the risk of default on the retailers'
lease obligations is less than the retailers' unsecured general obligations.  It
has been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail
locations  in order to  survive  in the event of  reorganization,  they are less
likely to reject a lease for a profitable location,  which would terminate their
right to use the property.  Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will fare
better  than  unsecured   creditors  of  the  same  retailer  in  the  event  of
reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during a reorganization,
we own  the  property  and can  either  lease  it to a new  tenant  or sell  the
property.  In  addition,  we believe that the risk of default on the real estate
leases can be further  mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers'
individual unit locations and selling those units that are weaker performers.

In order to qualify for inclusion in our  portfolio,  new property  acquisitions
must meet stringent  investment  and credit  requirements.  The properties  must
generate  attractive  current  yields,  and the  tenant  must  meet  our  credit
standards.  We  have  established  a  three-part  analysis  that  examines  each
potential investment based on:

o  Industry, company, market conditions and credit profile;
o  Location profitability, if profitability data is available; and
o  Overall real estate  characteristics,  including value and comparative rental
   rates.

Companies  whose  properties  have been approved for  acquisition  are generally
those with 50 or more retail  stores that are located in highly  visible  areas,
with easy access to major thoroughfares and attractive demographics.





ACQUISITION  STRATEGY.  We  seek to  invest  in  industries  in  which  several,
well-organized,  regional and national chains are capturing market share through
service,  quality control,  economies of scale,  mass media  advertising and the
selection  of prime retail  locations.  We execute our  acquisition  strategy by
acting as a source of capital to regional and national  retail chain stores in a
variety of  industries  by  acquiring,  then  leasing  back their  retail  store
locations.  We undertake thorough research and analysis to identify  appropriate
industries,   tenants  and  property  locations  for  investment.  Our  research
expertise is applied to uncover  net-lease  opportunities  in markets  where our
real estate financing program adds value. In selecting real estate for potential
investment,  we generally  seek to acquire  properties  that have the  following
characteristics:

o  Freestanding, commercially zoned property with a single tenant;
o  Properties  that are  important  retail  locations  for regional and national
   retail chains;
o  Properties that are located within  attractive  demographic areas relative to
   the business of their tenants,  with high visibility and easy access to major
   thoroughfares; and
o  Properties  that  can  be  purchased  with  the  simultaneous   execution  or
   assumption of long-term, net-lease agreements,  providing the opportunity for
   both current income and future rent increases.


PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT  STRATEGY.  The active management of the property portfolio
is an essential component of our long-term strategy.  We continually monitor our
portfolio  for changes  that could  affect the  performance  of the  industries,
tenants and locations in which we have invested. The portfolio is analyzed on an
ongoing  basis with a view toward  optimizing  returns and  enhancing the credit
quality of the portfolio.  Realty Income's investment committee meets frequently
and is made up of our Chief  Executive  Officer,  President and  Executive  Vice
President. Our investment committee reviews industry research,  tenant research,
property due diligence and significant  portfolio  management  activities.  This
monitoring typically includes ongoing review and analysis of:

o  The performance of various retail industries;
o  The operation,  management,  business planning and financial condition of the
   tenants; and
o  The health of the individual markets in which we own properties, from both an
   economic and real estate standpoint.

We have an active  portfolio  management  program that  incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the  reinvestment  of the sales  proceeds  will  generate
higher  returns,  enhance  the credit  quality of our real estate  portfolio  or
extend our average  remaining  lease terms.  At December 31, 2001, we classified
real estate with a carrying  amount of $23.4  million as held for sale.  Of this
amount, investments owned by our taxable REIT subsidiary Crest Net totaled $22.3
million.  Additionally,  we anticipate  selling  properties  from our portfolio,
which have not yet been specifically  identified.  We anticipate receiving up to
$50 million in proceeds from the sale of  properties  during the next 12 months.
We intend to invest these proceeds into new retail properties.


CAPITAL  MARKETS  STRATEGY.  We believe  our  stockholders  are best served by a
conservative  capital structure.  At March 1, 2002, our total outstanding credit
facility  borrowings and outstanding  notes were $303.5 million or approximately
20.9% of our total market  capitalization of $1.45 billion.  We define our total
market capitalization as the sum of:

o  The shares of our common stock  outstanding  multiplied  by the last reported
   sales  price of the  common  stock on the NYSE on March 1, 2002 of $31.40 per
   share;
o  The liquidation value of the Class B Preferred Stock;
o  The liquidation value of the Class C Preferred Stock; and
o  Outstanding  borrowings on the credit  facilities  and  outstanding  notes at
   March 1, 2002.




We have a $200 million  revolving,  unsecured  acquisition  credit facility that
expires in December 2003. We also have a $25 million revolving, unsecured credit
facility  that  expires in  February  2003.  At March 1, 2002,  the  outstanding
balance on the $200 million  acquisition  credit facility was $50.7 million with
an  effective  interest  rate of  approximately  3.1%.  At  March 1,  2002,  the
outstanding balance on the $25 million credit facility was $22.8 million with an
effective  interest rate of  approximately  3.1%. A commitment fee of 0.225% per
annum accrues on the total credit commitment of each credit facility. The credit
facilities  have been and are expected to be used to acquire  additional  retail
properties  leased to regional  and national  retail  chains under long term net
lease  agreements.  The credit facilities have also been used to provide capital
to subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties.

We use our credit  facilities as a vehicle for the  short-term  financing of the
acquisition  of new  properties.  When  outstanding  borrowings  under  the $200
million  acquisition  credit  facility  reach a certain level  (generally in the
range of $75 to $175 million) and capital is available on acceptable  terms,  we
generally seek to refinance those  borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term
or  permanent  financing,  which may  include  the  issuance  of  common  stock,
preferred stock,  convertible  preferred  stock,  debt securities or convertible
debt securities.  We cannot assure you, however,  that we will be able to obtain
any  such  refinancing  or that  market  conditions  prevailing  at the  time of
refinancing  will enable us to issue equity or debt  securities  upon acceptable
terms.  We intend to pay off borrowings on our $25 million credit  facility with
proceeds from the sale of properties owned by us or our subsidiaries.

Historically,  we have met our  long-term  capital needs through the issuance of
common stock, preferred stock and investment grade, long-term,  unsecured notes.
We believe the majority of our future  issuances of securities  should be in the
form of common stock.  However, we may issue additional  preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our
share  price is at a level that allows for the  proceeds  of any  offering to be
invested on an accretive basis into additional  properties.  In addition, we may
issue common stock to permanently  finance  properties  that were financed using
our credit  facilities or debt  securities.  We seek to maintain a  conservative
debt level on our balance  sheet and solid  interest and fixed  charge  coverage
ratios.

We currently  are assigned  investment  grade  corporate  credit  ratings on our
senior unsecured notes from Fitch IBCA Duff & Phelps,  Moody's Investor Service,
Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Group. Currently, Fitch IBCA Duff & Phelps has
assigned a rating of BBB,  Moody's has  assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard &
Poor's has assigned a rating of BBB- to our senior  notes.  These  ratings could
change based upon,  among other things,  our results of operations and financial
condition.

We also have  received  credit  ratings  from the same  rating  agencies  on our
preferred stock. Fitch IBCA Duff & Phelps has assigned a rating of BBB-, Moody's
Investor Service, Inc. has assigned a rating of Ba1 and Standard & Poor's Rating
Group has assigned a rating of BB+. These ratings could change based upon, among
other things, our results of operations and financial condition.

Realty  Income  and its  subsidiaries  have  no  unconsolidated  investments  in
"special purpose  entities" or off balance sheet financing,  nor do we engage in
trading activities  involving energy or commodity  contracts or other derivative
instruments.


COMPETITIVE  STRATEGY.  We  believe  to pursue  our  investment  philosophy  and
strategy most successfully,  we must seek to maintain the following  competitive
advantages:

o  Size and Type of  Investment  Properties:  We believe  smaller  ($500,000  to
   $10,000,000) retail net-leased  properties represent an attractive investment
   opportunity in today's real estate  environment.  Due to the  complexities of
   acquiring  and managing a large  portfolio of  relatively  small  assets,  we
   believe  these  types  of  properties   have  not   experienced   significant
   institutional  participation or the corresponding yield reduction experienced
   by  larger  income  producing  properties.  We  believe  the  less  intensive
   day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with
   the active  management  of a large  portfolio  of smaller  properties,  is an
   effective  investment  strategy.  The  tenants  of  our  freestanding  retail
   properties  generally  provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer
   needs.  In order to grow and expand,  they generally need capital.  Since the
   acquisition  of  real  estate  is  typically  the  single   largest   capital
   expenditure of many of these retailers, our method of purchasing the property
   and then  leasing it back  under a  net-lease  arrangement  allows the retail
   chain to free up capital.




o  Investment in New Retail  Industries:  Though we specialize in  single-tenant
   properties,  we will seek to further  diversify our portfolio among a variety
   of retail industries.  We believe  diversification will allow us to invest in
   retail industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find
   attractive.  These  characteristics  include,  but are not limited to, retail
   industries  dominated by local  operators  where  regional and national chain
   operators  can  gain  market  share  and  dominance  through  more  efficient
   operations,  as well as  industries  taking  advantage  of major  demographic
   shifts in the population base.

o  Diversification:  Diversification  of the portfolio by retail  industry type,
   tenant  and  geographic  location  is  key  to  our  objective  of  providing
   predictable investment results for our stockholders.  We continuously seek to
   further  diversify our portfolio.  At December 31, 2001, our retail  property
   portfolio  consisted of 1,124 properties  located in 48 states,  leased to 78
   retail chains doing business in 24 industry segments.

o  Management Specialization: We believe that our management's specialization in
   single-tenant  retail  properties  operated  under  net-lease  agreements  is
   important to meeting our objectives.  We plan to maintain this specialization
   and  will  seek  to  employ  and  train  high-quality  professionals  in this
   specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.

o  Technology:  We intend to stay at the  forefront of technology in our efforts
   to  efficiently  and  economically  carry out our  operations.  We maintain a
   sophisticated  information  system that allows us to analyze our  portfolio's
   performance and actively manage our  investments.  We believe that technology
   and information-based systems will play an increasingly important role in our
   competitiveness  as an investment  manager and source of capital to a variety
   of industries and tenants.


                                   PROPERTIES


At December 31, 2001, we owned a diversified portfolio:

o  Of 1,124 properties;
o  With an occupancy rate of 98.2%, or 1,104 of the 1,124 properties;
o  Leased to 78 retail chains doing business in 24 retail industries;
o  Located in 48 states;
o  With over 9.6 million  square feet of leasable  space;  and
o  With an average  leasable retail space of 8,600 square feet on  approximately
   62,300 square feet of land.

In addition to our real estate  portfolio at December 31, 2001, our  subsidiary,
Crest Net, owned 24 properties.

At December 31, 2001, 1,099, or 97.8%, of our 1,124 retail properties were under
net-lease agreements.  Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible
for minimum  monthly rent and property  operating  expenses  including  property
taxes,  insurance  and  maintenance  plus,  typically,   future  rent  increases
(generally  subject to ceilings) based on increases in the consumer price index,
fixed  increases or additional  rent  calculated as a percentage of the tenants'
gross sales above a specified level.




Our net-leased retail  properties  primarily are leased to regional and national
retail chain store operators.  Generally,  buildings are single-story properties
with adequate parking on site to accommodate  peak retail traffic  periods.  The
properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts
and adequate  access,  egress and proximity to a sufficient  population  base to
constitute a suitable market or trade area for the retailer's business.

The following  table sets forth  certain  information  regarding our  properties
classified  according to the business of the respective tenants,  expressed as a
percentage of our total rental revenue:






Of the 1,124  properties  in the  portfolio  at December  31,  2001,  1,119 were
single-tenant  properties  with  the  remaining  properties  being  multi-tenant
properties.  At December 31, 2001, 1,099 of the 1,119 single-tenant  properties,
or 98.2%,  were leased with a weighted  average  remaining lease term (excluding
extension options) of approximately 10.4 years.

The following table sets forth certain  information  regarding the timing of the
initial lease term expirations  (excluding  extension  options) on our 1,099 net
leased,  single-tenant  retail  properties  at  December  31,  2001  (dollars in
thousands):

DESCRIPTION OF LEASING  STRUCTURE.  At December 31, 2001,  1,099 or 97.8% of the
Company's 1,124  properties  were leased pursuant to net leases.  In most cases,
the leases:

o  Were for initial terms of from 15 to 20 years with the tenants  having one or
   more options to extend the initial term;

o  Require  the  tenants  to pay  property  taxes,  insurance  and  expenses  of
   maintaining the property;

o  Provide for a minimum base rent plus future increases  (typically  subject to
   ceilings)  based on increases in the consumer  price index,  additional  rent
   based upon the tenants' gross sales above a specified level (i.e., percentage
   rent) or fixed  increases.  Where leases provide for rent increases  based on
   increases in the consumer price index,  generally these increases permanently
   become part of the base rent.  Where leases provide for percentage rent, this
   additional  rent is typically  payable only if the tenants' gross sales for a
   given  period  (usually  one  year)  exceed a  specified  level,  and then is
   typically  calculated  as a  percentage  of only the amount of gross sales in
   excess of that level.


MATTERS PERTAINING TO CERTAIN  PROPERTIES AND TENANTS.  Twenty of our properties
were  available  for  sale or lease  at  December  31,  2001,  all of which  are
single-tenant  properties.  Ten of the properties had been previously  leased to
child care operators,  one to a home  furnishings  store operator,  five to home
improvement  operators,  three to  restaurant  operators and one to a shoe store
operator.  At December 31, 2001, 22 of our properties under lease were available
for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other
obligations.

Our  largest  tenant,   Children's   World  Learning   Centers,   accounted  for
approximately 12.1% of our rental revenue in 2001. No other tenant comprised 10%
or more of our rental revenue.  At December 31, 2001,  Children's World Learning
Centers  accounted for  approximately  11.3% of our annualized rent.  Annualized
rent is calculated by multiplying the monthly  contractual base rent for each of
the  properties  by 12 and adding the  previous 12 month's  historic  percentage
rent,  excluding  properties  owned by Crest Net. In general,  a downturn in the
industry  represented by this tenant,  whether nationwide or limited to specific
sectors of the United States,  could adversely  affect tenants in this industry,
which in turn could  materially  adversely  affect our  financial  position  and
results of operations and our ability to make  distributions to stockholders and
debt service payments.  In addition,  a substantial number of our properties are
leased to middle market retail chains that generally have more limited financial
and other  resources than certain upper market retail chains,  and therefore are
more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective  business
or in the regional or national economy generally.

Our  tenants  in  the  child  care  and  restaurant   industries  accounted  for
approximately 23.6% and 12.1%, respectively,  of our rental revenue for the year
ended  December 31, 2001.  A downturn in either of these  industries  generally,
whether  nationwide or limited to specific  sectors of the United States,  could
adversely  affect tenants in those  industries,  which in turn could  materially
adversely  affect our  financial  position  and  results of  operations  and our
ability to make distributions to stockholders and debt service payments.


DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES.  Of the 91 properties we acquired in 2001 and
26 properties  acquired by Crest Net in 2001, all but six were occupied at March
1, 2002. The six  properties  were leased and under  construction  pursuant to a
contract  under  which the tenant has agreed to  develop  the  properties  (with
development  costs  funded by us or Crest  Net) with  rent  commencing  when the
premises open for business.  In the case of  development  properties,  we either
enter  into an  agreement  with a retail  chain  where  the  retailer  retains a
contractor  to  construct  the  improvements  and we  fund  the  costs  of  that
development,  or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements.  In either
case,  there is an executed  lease and there is a  requirement  to complete  the
construction on a timely basis,  generally within eight months after we purchase
the land.  Generally,  the tenant or developer  is required to pay  construction
cost overruns to the extent they exceed the  construction  budget by more than a
predetermined  amount. We also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we
purchase the land,  which generally  requires the tenant begin paying base rent,
calculated as a percentage of our acquisition  cost for the property,  including
construction  costs  and  capitalized  interest,  when the  premises  opens  for
business.  In 2001,  we  acquired  four  development  properties,  and Crest Net
acquired eight development  properties,  six of which have been completed,  were
operating and generating  rent as of March 1, 2002. Both Realty Income and Crest
Net  will  continue  to seek to  acquire  land  for  development  under  similar
arrangements.





OTHER ITEMS

COMPETITION  FOR  ACQUISITION  OF  REAL  ESTATE.  We  face  competition  in  the
acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect competition from:

o  Businesses;
o  Individuals;
o  Fiduciary  accounts and plans;  and o Other  entities  engaged in real estate
   investment.

Some of these  competitors  are larger  than we are and have  greater  financial
resources.  This  competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish
to purchase.

The tenants leasing our properties  generally face significant  competition from
other operators. This competition may adversely impact:

o  That  portion,  if any,  of the  rental  stream  to be paid to us  based on a
   tenant's revenues; and
o  The tenants' results of operations or financial condition.


ENVIRONMENTAL  LIABILITIES.  Investments in real property can create a potential
for  environmental  liability.  An owner of  property  can  face  liability  for
environmental  contamination  created by the  presence or discharge of hazardous
substances on the property. We face such liability regardless of:

o  Our knowledge of the contamination;
o  The timing of the contamination;
o  The cause of the contamination; or
o  The party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There may be environmental  problems  associated with our properties of which we
are unaware.  In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators
of  oil  change  and  tune-up  facilities,  and  convenience  stores  that  sell
petroleum-based fuels. These facilities, or other of our properties, use, or may
have used in the past,  underground tanks for the storage of  petroleum-based or
waste  products  which  could  create  a  potential  for  release  of  hazardous
substances.

The presence of hazardous  substances  on a property  may  adversely  affect our
ability to sell that property and we may incur  substantial  remediation  costs.
Although our leases generally  require our tenants to operate in compliance with
all applicable federal,  state and local laws, ordinances and regulations and to
indemnify  us against any  environmental  liabilities  arising from the tenants'
activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability
by virtue of our  ownership  interest,  and there can be no  assurance  that our
tenants would satisfy their  indemnification  obligations under the leases.  The
discovery of environmental  liabilities  attached to our properties could have a
material  adverse effect on our results of operations or financial  condition or
our ability to make distributions to stockholders.




We have not been notified by any governmental  authority,  and are not otherwise
aware, of any material  noncompliance,  liability or claim relating to hazardous
or toxic substances or petroleum  products in connection with any of our present
properties.  Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could
be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest.

Since December 1996, we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our
property portfolio. The limit on our current policy is $5 million per occurrence
and $25 million in the aggregate,  subject to a $100,000 self-insured  retention
per occurrence. There is a sublimit on properties with underground storage tanks
of $1 million  per  occurrence  and $5 million  in the  aggregate,  subject to a
$25,000 self-insured retention per occurrence. It is possible that our insurance
will be insufficient to address any particular  environmental situation and that
we will be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental  matters, at
a reasonable cost or at all, in the future.


TAXATION OF THE COMPANY.  We believe that we are  organized  and have  operated,
commencing  with our taxable  year ended  December  31,  1994,  and we intend to
continue to operate,  so as to qualify as a "real estate investment trust" under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have
satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue
to be organized or that we have been or will continue to be able to operate in a
manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified.

Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under
highly  technical and complex Code  provisions  for which there are only limited
judicial and  administrative  interpretations,  and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For example,  in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
any year must be derived from qualifying  sources and we must pay  distributions
to  stockholders  aggregating  annually  at least 90% (95% prior to 2001) of our
REIT taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations,  administrative
interpretations  or court  decisions  will  change the tax laws with  respect to
qualification  as a  REIT  or the  federal  income  tax  consequences  of  those
qualifications.

If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

o  We  would  be  subject  to  federal  income  tax  (including  any  applicable
   alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
o  We would not be allowed a  deduction  in  computing  our  taxable  income for
   amounts distributed to our stockholders;
o  We could be disqualified  from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
   following the year during which qualification is lost;
o  We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and
o  This  treatment  would  substantially  reduce our net earnings  available for
   investment or  distribution  to  stockholders  because of the  additional tax
   liability for the years involved.

Even if we qualify for and maintain  our REIT status,  we are subject to certain
federal,  state and local taxes on our income and property.  For example,  if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction,  that income will be subject to a
100% tax. Our subsidiary  Crest Net is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property.






EFFECT  OF  DISTRIBUTION  REQUIREMENTS.  To  maintain  our  status as a REIT for
federal  income tax  purposes,  we generally  are required to  distribute to our
stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income  determined  without regard
to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year.

We also are  subject to tax at  regular  corporate  rates to the extent  that we
distribute  less than 100% of our REIT  taxable  income  (including  net capital
gains) each year.

In addition,  we are subject to a 4% nondeductible  excise tax on the amount, if
any, by which certain  distributions  we pay, with respect to any calendar year,
are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary  income for that calendar year, 95%
of our capital  gain net income for the  calendar  year,  and any amount of that
income that was not distributed in prior years.

We intend to continue to make  distributions  to our stockholders to comply with
the  distribution  requirements  of the Code and to reduce  exposure  to federal
income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the
receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at taxable  income and
the effect of required  debt  amortization  payments  could require us to borrow
funds  on a  short-term  basis to meet the  distribution  requirements  that are
necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.


DILUTION OF COMMON  STOCK.  Our future growth will depend in large part upon our
ability to raise  additional  capital.  If we were to raise  additional  capital
through the  issuance of equity  securities,  we could  dilute the  interests of
holders of common stock. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause
us to issue preferred  stock of any class or series (with  dividend,  voting and
other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board of
Directors may authorize  the issuance of preferred  stock with voting,  dividend
and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise  adversely affect,  the
interests of holders of common stock.


REAL  ESTATE  OWNERSHIP  RISKS.  We are  subject  to all  of the  general  risks
associated  with the ownership of real estate.  In particular,  we face the risk
that  rental  revenue  from the  properties  may be  insufficient  to cover  all
corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and
distributions on our stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:

o  Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;
o  Changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties;
o  Changes in interest rates and operating expenses;
o  Competition for tenants;
o  Changes in market rental rates;
o  Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;
o  Renewal of leases at lower rental rates;
o  Inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship,  including
   bankruptcy;
o  Changes in tax, real estate,  zoning and environmental  laws that may have an
   adverse impact upon the value of real estate;
o  Uninsured property liability;
o  Property damage or casualty losses;
o  Unexpected  expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into
   compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws; o Acts of terrorism
   and war; and
o  Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.


DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL.  We depend on the efforts of our executive officers
and key  employees.  The loss of the services of our executive  officers and key
employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We are subject to certain  claims and  lawsuits,  the outcome of which cannot be
determined  at this time. In the opinion of  management,  any liability we might
incur  upon the  resolution  of these  claims  and  lawsuits  will  not,  in the
aggregate,  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  consolidated  financial
statements taken as a whole.

        (not covered by Independent Auditors' Report)










ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     GENERAL

Realty  Income   Corporation,   "The  Monthly  Dividend   Company,"  a  Maryland
corporation  ("Realty  Income," the "Company," "us," "we" or "our") is organized
to operate as an equity real estate  investment  trust ("REIT").  We are a fully
integrated  self-administered  real estate  company with  in-house  acquisition,
leasing, legal, retail research, real estate research,  portfolio management and
capital markets expertise.

Our primary business objective is to generate  dependable monthly dividends from
a consistent and predictable  level of funds from operations  ("FFO") per share.
Additionally,  we generally will seek to increase  distributions to stockholders
and FFO per share through both active  portfolio  management and the acquisition
of additional properties.

At December 31, 2001, we owned a diversified portfolio:

o  Of 1,124 properties;
o  With an occupancy rate of 98.2%, or 1,104 of the 1,124 properties;
o  Leased to 78 retail chains doing business in 24 retail industries;
o  Located in 48 states;
o  With over 9.6 million square feet of leasable space; and
o  With an average leasable retail space of  approximately  8,600 square feet on
   approximately 62,300 square feet of land.

In addition to our real estate  portfolio,  at December 31, 2001, our subsidiary
Crest Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest Net") owned a portfolio:

o  Of 24 retail properties;
o  Located in 14 states;
o  That will contain  approximately 92,300 square feet of leasable space; o That
   are 100% leased and are held for sale; and o For a total  investment of $22.3
   million.


                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


CASH  RESERVES.  Realty  Income is  organized  to operate as an equity REIT that
acquires and leases  properties and distributes to stockholders,  in the form of
monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated
from leases on its retail properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount
of cash as  working  capital.  At  December  31,  2001,  we had  cash  and  cash
equivalents totaling $2.5 million.

We  believe  that our cash and cash  equivalents  on hand,  cash  provided  from
operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity
needs for the foreseeable future. We intend,  however, to use additional sources
of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facilities.


CAPITAL FUNDING. We have a $200 million revolving,  unsecured acquisition credit
facility that expires in December  2003.  We also have a $25 million  revolving,
unsecured  credit facility that expires in February 2003. The credit  facilities
currently  bear  interest at 1.225% over the London  Interbank  Offered Rate, or
LIBOR,  and offer us other  interest  rate  options.  At March 1,  2002,  we had
borrowing  capacity of $151.5 million  available on our credit facilities and an
outstanding balance of $73.5 million with an effective interest rate of 3.1%.







These  credit  facilities  have  been  and are  expected  to be used to  acquire
additional retail properties leased to national and regional retail chains under
long-term lease agreements. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure
to interest rate risk. We have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

In June  1999,  we  filed a  universal  shelf  registration  statement  with the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission  covering up to $409.2  million in value of
common stock,  preferred  stock and debt  securities.  Through March 1, 2002, we
have issued $209.3 million of common stock,  preferred stock and debt securities
under the universal shelf registration statement. At March 1, 2002, a balance of
$199.9 million was available under our universal shelf registration statement.

In May 2001, we issued 2,850,000 shares of common stock at a price of $27.80 per
share. We issued an additional  100,000 shares in May 2001 when the underwriters
exercised their  over-allotment  option.  The net proceeds of $77.5 million were
used to repay borrowings under our $200 million  acquisition credit facility and
for other general corporate purposes.

In October 2001, we issued 2,600,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50
per share.  We issued an  additional  350,000  shares in November  2001 when the
underwriters  exercised their  over-allotment  option. The net proceeds of $79.5
million were used to repay borrowings under our $200 million  acquisition credit
facility and for other general corporate purposes.

In February 2002, we issued 273,150 shares of common stock to a unit  investment
trust at a net price to us of $30.26 per share,  based on a 5%  discount  to the
market  price at the time of issuance of $31.85 per share.  The net  proceeds of
$8.2 million were used to repay bank borrowings.

We believe  that our  stockholders  are best  served by a  conservative  capital
structure.  At March 1, 2002, our total outstanding  credit facility  borrowings
and outstanding  notes were $303.5 million or  approximately  20.9% of our total
market   capitalization   of  $1.45   billion.   We  define  our  total   market
capitalization as the sum of the:

o  Shares of our common stock outstanding  multiplied by the last reported sales
   price of the common stock on the NYSE on March 1, 2002 of $31.40 per share;
o  Liquidation value of the Class B Preferred Stock;
o  Liquidation value of the Class C Preferred Stock; and
o  Outstanding  borrowings on the credit  facilities  and  outstanding  notes at
   March 1, 2002.

Historically,  we have met our  long-term  capital needs through the issuance of
common stock, preferred stock and investment grade, long-term,  unsecured notes.
We believe that the majority of our future issuances of securities  should be in
the form of common stock.  However,  we may issue additional  preferred stock or
debt  securities  from time to time.  We may issue  common stock when we believe
that our share price is at a level that allows for the  proceeds of any offering
to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties. In addition, we
may issue common stock to permanently  finance  properties that were financed by
our credit facilities or debt securities.  However, we cannot assure you that we
will have access to the capital  markets at terms that are  acceptable to us. We
seek to  maintain  a  conservative  debt  level on our  balance  sheet and solid
interest and fixed charge coverage ratios.

We currently  are assigned  investment  grade  corporate  credit  ratings on our
senior unsecured notes from Fitch IBCA Duff & Phelps,  Moody's Investor Service,
Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Group. Currently, Fitch IBCA Duff & Phelps has
assigned a rating of BBB,  Moody's has  assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard &
Poor's has assigned a rating of BBB- to our senior  notes.  These  ratings could
change based upon,  among other things,  our results of operations and financial
condition.






We also have  received  credit  ratings  from the same  rating  agencies  on our
preferred stock. Fitch IBCA Duff & Phelps has assigned a rating of BBB-, Moody's
Investor Service, Inc. has assigned a rating of Ba1 and Standard & Poor's Rating
Group has assigned a rating of BB+. These ratings could change based upon, among
other things, our results of operations and financial condition.

Realty  Income  and its  subsidiaries  have  no  unconsolidated  investments  in
"special purpose  entities" or off balance sheet financing,  nor do we engage in
trading activities  involving energy or commodity  contracts or other derivative
instruments.


PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. In 2001, we acquired 91 properties (the "New Properties")
located in 25 states.  In 2001, we invested $131.8 million in the New Properties
and properties under development, which includes investments of $7.1 million for
properties  acquired  before  2001.  Estimated  unfunded  development  costs  on
properties  under  construction  at December 31, 2001 totaled $3.1  million.  In
2001, we  capitalized  $401,000 for  re-leasing  costs and $547,000 for building
improvements on existing properties in our portfolio.

The initial  weighted  average annual  unleveraged  return on the $131.8 million
invested in 2001 is estimated to be 11.0%, computed as estimated contractual net
operating  income  (which in the case of a  net-leased  property is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of properties under  construction,  the estimated base
rent under the lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated
total costs.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of
contractual  rent,  we cannot  assure  you that the  actual  return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentage listed above.

The New Properties will contain  approximately  877,200 leasable square feet and
are 100% leased  under net leases,  with an average  initial  lease term of 20.1
years.  At December 31, 2001,  two of the New  Properties  were leased and under
construction,  pursuant to contracts  under which the tenants  agreed to develop
the  properties  (with  development  costs  funded by Realty  Income)  with rent
scheduled to begin in the first half of 2002.

In 2000, we acquired 13 properties  (the "2000  Properties")  and invested $70.0
million in the 2000  Properties and properties  under  development.  In 2000, we
also paid $308,000 for re-leasing costs and $90,000 for building improvements on
existing  properties  in our  portfolio.  The initial  weighted  average  annual
unleveraged  return on the $70.0  million  invested in 2000 is  estimated  to be
10.8%,  computed in the same manner as 2001's estimated initial weighted average
annual unleveraged  return and subject to the same uncertainty  described above.
These 13 properties contain  approximately  676,100 leasable square feet and are
100% leased under net leases, with an average initial lease term of 18.3 years.


DISTRIBUTIONS.  We pay monthly distributions to our common stockholders. We paid
cash  distributions  to our common  stockholders of $64.9 million in 2001, $58.3
million in 2000 and $55.9 million in 1999.

We pay quarterly  distributions to our Class B preferred  stockholders.  We paid
cash distributions to our Class B preferred stockholders of $6.4 million in both
2001 and 2000 and $3.9 million in 1999.  Our Class B preferred  stock was issued
in May 1999.

We pay monthly distributions to our Class C preferred stockholders. We paid cash
distributions to our Class C preferred stockholders of $3.3 million in both 2001
and 2000 and $1.4  million in 1999.  Our Class C  preferred  stock was issued in
July 1999.







CREST NET LEASE.  We  created  Crest Net in  January  2000 to buy,  own and sell
properties,  primarily to buyers using tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031
of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended.  (the  "Code").  In order to
comply with the REIT  qualification  requirements in force when we created Crest
Net, 5% of the common stock of Crest Net, which  represented  100% of the voting
stock,  was not owned by the Company.  Effective for 2001, the Code was modified
to  allow a REIT  to own up to  100%  of the  voting  stock  and/or  value  of a
corporation  that elects with the REIT and  qualifies to be treated as a taxable
REIT subsidiary.  Following the change in the Code,  Realty Income and Crest Net
jointly  elected  to treat  Crest Net as a taxable  REIT  subsidiary,  effective
January 1, 2001,  and in May 2001 we acquired the 5% of Crest Net's common stock
owned by certain  members of our  management and the management of Crest Net for
$507,000.  The acquisition of the 5% of common stock was accounted for under the
purchase  method  of  accounting.  The  disinterested  members  of our  Board of
Directors  unanimously  approved this  transaction.  Crest Net originally issued
this stock for $450,000. Realty Income also received rights to the undistributed
earnings on the stock,  which totaled $81,200.  After this  transaction,  Realty
Income owns 100% of Crest Net's stock.

In 2000, we invested $8.6 million in Crest Net common stock.  In February  2000,
we entered into a $25 million,  revolving  credit  facility  with Crest Net. The
financial  statements  of  Crest  Net  are  consolidated  into  Realty  Income's
financial  statements.   All  material   intercompany   transactions  have  been
eliminated in consolidation.

In 2001,  Crest Net invested  $24.7 million in 26 retail  properties.  Estimated
unfunded development costs on properties under construction at December 31, 2001
totaled $2.8 million.  These 26 properties will contain approximately 102,300 of
leasable  square feet,  are 100% leased and have initial  lease terms  averaging
20.1 years. Three of these properties were sold in 2001.

In 2000, Crest Net invested $28.6 million in nine retail properties.  These nine
properties contain  approximately  398,100 leasable square feet, are 100% leased
and have initial lease terms  averaging  19.0 years.  Eight of these  properties
were sold during 2000 and 2001.

In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties from its inventory for $28.9 million and
we recorded a gain of $3.4 million,  before  income  taxes.  At the end of 2001,
Crest Net  carried an  inventory  of $22.3  million,  which is  included in real
estate held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet.

In 2001,  Crest Net generated  $2.4 million in funds from  operations for Realty
Income.  The  contribution,  if any,  to our FFO by Crest Net will depend on the
timing and the number of  property  sales  achieved by Crest Net, if any, in any
given year.

In 2000,  Crest Net sold two  properties for $6.2 million and we recorded a gain
of $766,000, before income taxes. In 2000, Crest Net generated $422,000 in funds
from operations for Realty Income.


STOCK AND SENIOR DEBT  PURCHASE  PROGRAM.  We  regularly  review our  investment
options to determine the best use of our capital.  In January 2000, our Board of
Directors authorized the purchase of up to $10 million of our outstanding common
stock,  preferred  stock and  senior  debt  securities.  From time to time since
January  2000, we concluded our share price  justified  purchasing  shares since
this provided an attractive  return on our investment  capital.  We purchased an
aggregate of $6.7 million of our securities  from January 2000 through  December
2001.  In 2001,  we invested  $169,000 to  purchase  6,800  shares of our common
stock.







                          FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ("FFO")

Our FFO for 2001 increased by $10.6 million,  or 15.8%,  to $77.8 million versus
$67.2  million  in 2000.  FFO in 1999 was  $65.9  million.  The  following  is a
reconciliation  of net  income  available  to  common  stockholders  to FFO  and
information regarding distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number
of shares outstanding for 2001, 2000 and 1999 (dollars in thousands):


We  define  FFO,  consistent  with  the  National  Association  of  Real  Estate
Investment Trust's definition,  as net income available to common  stockholders,
plus  depreciation and  amortization of assets uniquely  significant to the real
estate  industry,  reduced  by gains  and  increased  by  losses on (i) sales of
investment property and provisions for impairment and (ii) extraordinary items.

The  following  is a  reconciliation  of FFO to adjusted FFO for the years ended
December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999.  The  adjustments  are for non-cash items and
capitalized  expenditures  on existing  properties in our portfolio  (dollars in
thousands):






We consider FFO and adjusted FFO to be appropriate  measures of the  performance
of equity  REITs.  Financial  analysts use FFO and  adjusted  FFO in  evaluating
REITs.  FFO and  adjusted  FFO can be a way to measure a REIT's  ability to make
cash  distribution  payments.  Presentation  of this  information is intended to
assist the reader in comparing the performance of different  REITs,  although it
should be noted that not all REITs  calculate FFO and adjusted FFO the same way;
therefore, comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful.

FFO and adjusted FFO are not  necessarily  indicative of cash flow  available to
fund cash needs and should not be considered as an  alternative to net income as
an indication of Realty Income's performance.  In addition, FFO and adjusted FFO
should not be  considered  as an  alternative  to reviewing  our cash flows from
operating,  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity, of our
ability to make cash distributions or our ability to pay interest payments.

In 2001 and 2000,  Crest Net generated $2.4 million and $422,000,  respectively,
in FFO for Realty  Income.  The  following is a  calculation  of Crest Net's FFO
contribution to Realty Income for 2001 and 2000 (dollars in thousands):




                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management  is  required  to make a number of  assumptions  and  estimates  that
directly impact the consolidated  financial  statements and related disclosures.
Those  assumptions  and  estimates  are the basis for certain of our  accounting
policies  described  in note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The
accounting  policies  that are most  important to the portrayal of the Company's
financial  condition and results of operations,  and require  management's  most
difficult,  subjective  or complex  judgments,  are  considered  to be  critical
accounting policies. Because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions
and  estimates   regarding  unknown  future  outcomes,   events  may  result  in
significant  differences  between our estimates and actual  results.  Management
believes that each of our assumptions  and estimates are  appropriate  under the
circumstances,  and represent the most likely  outcome.  We believe our critical
accounting  policies  relate to depreciable  lives of our real estate assets and
recoverability (impairment) of our real estate assets.







THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON  OF OUR RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000.

Rental  revenue was $122.1  million for 2001 versus $117.2  million for 2000, an
increase  of  $4.9  million,   or  4.2%.  The  increase  in  rental  revenue  is
attributable to:

o  The 91 properties acquired in 2001, which generated revenue of $2.9 million;
o  The 13 properties  acquired in 2000, which generated  revenue of $6.0 million
   in 2001 compared to $1.7 million in 2000, an increase of $4.3 million;
o  Properties  owned by Crest Net,  which  generated  revenue of $1.8 million in
   2001 compared to $1.2 million in 2000, an increase of $588,000;
o  Properties sold during 2000 and 2001, which generated revenue of $1.4 million
   in 2001 as compared to $7.0 million in 2000, a decrease of $5.6 million;
o  Net rental  increase of $900,000 on development  properties  acquired  before
   2000 that started paying rent in 2000 and properties  that were vacant during
   part of 2000 or 2001; and
o  Same store rents generated on 977 leased properties owned in all of both 2001
   and 2000 increased by $1.8 million,  or 1.8%, to $105.24 million from $103.41
   million.

Of the 1,124 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2001,  1,119, or 99.6%,
are single-tenant  properties with the remaining  properties being  multi-tenant
properties.  Of the 1,119  single-tenant  properties,  1,099, or 98.2%, were net
leased  with a  weighted  average  remaining  lease  term  (excluding  extension
options)  of  approximately  10.4  years.  Of  our  1,099  leased  single-tenant
properties,  1,087,  or 98.9%,  were under leases that provide for  increases in
rents through:

o  Base rent increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings;
o  Percentage rent based on a percentage of the tenants' gross sales;
o  Fixed increases; or
o  A combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage rent,  which is included in rental revenue,  was $1.7 million in 2001
and $2.0 million in 2000.

Our portfolio of quality retail real estate owned under net leases  continues to
perform well and provide  dependable  lease  revenue  supporting  the payment of
monthly dividends.  At December 31, 2001, our property portfolio of 1,124 retail
properties was 98.2% leased with only 20 properties available for lease or sale.

Of the 20 properties not leased at December 31, 2001,  transactions  to lease or
sell eight  properties  were  underway  or  completed  as of March 1,  2002.  We
anticipate  these  transactions  to be completed  during the first half of 2002;
although  we  cannot  assure  you that all of these  properties  will be sold or
leased within this period.


GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED FOR RESALE.  In 2001,  Crest Net sold nine
properties  for $28.9 million and we  recognized a gain of $3.4 million,  before
income taxes.  In 2000,  Crest Net sold two  properties  for $6.2 million and we
recognized a gain of $766,000, before income taxes.

At December 31, 2001,  Crest Net had $22.3  million  invested in 24  properties,
which are held for sale. It is Crest Net's intent to carry an average  inventory
of between  $20 to $25  million in real  estate on an ongoing  basis.  Crest Net
generates an earnings  spread on the  difference  between the lease  payments it
receives  and the cost of capital  used to  acquire  the  properties.  It is our
belief that at this level of  inventory,  these  earnings will cover the ongoing
operating expenses of Crest Net.







INTEREST EXPENSE.  The following is a summary of the five components of interest
expense for 2001 and 2000 (dollars in thousands):


Interest on  outstanding  loans and notes was $5.8 million lower in 2001 than in
2000  primarily  due to a decrease of $58.9  million in the average  outstanding
balances  and a decrease of 35 basis  points in our average  interest  rate.  In
2001,  the  Federal  Reserve  decreased  the  federal  funds rate 11 times by an
aggregate total of 475 basis points. Correspondingly, the average borrowing rate
on our credit  facilities  has  declined  during the same  period.  The  average
interest rate on our credit facilities  decreased to 6.36% in 2001 from 7.67% in
2000.  The majority of our credit  facilities  interest rate  reductions in 2001
occurred during the second half of the year.

At December 31, 2001, the weighted average interest rate on our:

o  Credit facility borrowings of $85.3 million was 3.13%;
o  Notes payable of $230 million was 7.99%; and
o  Combined outstanding credit facilities and notes of $315.3 million was 6.68%.

Our debt  service  coverage  ratio  for 2001 was 4.4  times and for 2000 was 3.5
times.  Debt service  coverage ratio is calculated as follows:  earnings (income
from  operations)  before  interest,  taxes,   depreciation,   amortization  and
impairment  losses ("EBITDA")  divided by interest  expense.  Our EBITDA for the
year ended  December  31, 2001 and 2000 was $115.9  million and $109.4  million,
respectively. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any
measure of performance as promulgated  under GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA may
be  different  from the  calculation  used by other  companies  and,  therefore,
comparability may be limited.

Our fixed  coverage  ratio  for 2001 was 3.2  times and for 2000 was 2.7  times.
Fixed  coverage  ratio is  calculated as follows:  EBITDA  divided by the sum of
interest expense and preferred stock dividends.  This information  should not be
considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated  under
GAAP.


DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION was $29.1 million in 2001 versus $29.0 million in
2000. The increase in depreciation  and  amortization was due to the acquisition
of properties in 2001,  which was offset by property sales in 2001. The majority
of our 2001  acquisitions  occurred during the fourth  quarter.  Depreciation of
buildings and  improvements is computed using the  straight-line  method over an
estimated  useful  life of 25 years.  If we used a shorter  or longer  estimated
useful  life it could have a material  impact on our results of  operations  and
financial  position.  We believe  that 25 years is an  appropriate  estimate  of
useful life.





Amortization of goodwill for each of the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $924,000.
In  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  142,
"Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets,"  effective  January 2002, our goodwill
will no longer be amortized,  but instead will be tested for impairment at least
annually.  If goodwill is determined to be impaired,  a provision for impairment
will be recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.


GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  increased  by $997,000 to $7.8 million in
2001  versus $6.8  million in 2000.  General  and  administrative  expenses as a
percentage  of revenue  increased  to 6.2% in 2001 as  compared to 5.8% in 2000.
Included in general and  administrative  expenses  are  $496,000 and $333,000 of
expenses attributable to Crest Net in 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  General and
administrative expenses, excluding expenses attributable to Crest Net, increased
primarily due to increases in the cost of living,  which  includes  increases in
payroll costs.

We had 53 employees at March 1, 2002 compared to 49 employees at March 1, 2001.


PROPERTY  EXPENSES are broken down into costs  associated  with  non-net  leased
multi-tenant properties, unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio
expenses.  Expenses  related  to the  multi-tenant  and  unleased  single-tenant
properties  include,  but are  not  limited  to,  property  taxes,  maintenance,
insurance,  utilities,  property  inspections,  bad debt expense and legal fees.
General  portfolio  costs  include,  but are not limited to,  insurance,  legal,
property  inspections and title search fees. At December 31, 2001, 20 properties
were available for lease or sale, as compared to 25 at December 31, 2000.

Property  expenses  were $2.5  million  in 2001 and $2.0  million  in 2000.  The
$500,000 increase in property expenses is primarily  attributable to an increase
in portfolio property  insurance and costs associated with properties  available
for lease.


OTHER EXPENSES were $1.8 million in 2001 and $813,000 in 2000.  The increase in
2001 is primarily  attributable  to an increase in Crest Net income  taxes.  The
following  is a  summary  of our other  expenses  in 2001 and 2000  (dollars  in
thousands):




PROVISION  FOR  IMPAIRMENT  LOSSES of $1.45  million was  recorded  in 2001.  No
provision for impairment loss was recorded in 2000 or 1999. We review long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that
the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  Generally, a provision
is  made  for  impairment  loss  if  estimated   future   operating  cash  flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated  disposition proceeds
(undiscounted)  are less than the  current  book  value.  Impairment  losses are
measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset  exceeds the
fair value of the asset.  The  carrying  value of our real estate is the largest
component of our  consolidated  balance sheet. If we were required to reduce the
carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses,
it could  have a material  impact on our  results of  operations  and  financial
position.







GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENT  PROPERTIES.  In 2001,  we sold 35 properties  for a
total of $39.5 million and recognized a gain of $10.5 million.  In 2000, we sold
21  properties  for a total  of  $45.2  million  and  recognized  a gain of $6.7
million.  Included in the 21 properties sold in 2000, are two properties  leased
by one of our tenants that we exchanged,  valued at $22.7 million, for two other
properties owned by that tenant. The gain recognized from property sales in 2001
was  $10.5  million,  or $3.8  million  greater  than the gain  recognized  from
property sales in 2000 of $6.7 million.

We have an active  portfolio  management  program that  incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the  reinvestment  of the sales  proceeds  will  generate
higher  returns,  enhance  the credit  quality of our real estate  portfolio  or
extend our average  remaining  lease terms.  At December 31, 2001, we classified
real estate with a carrying  amount of $23.4  million as held for sale, of which
$22.3  million  is owned by  Crest  Net.  Additionally,  we  anticipate  selling
investment  properties  from our portfolio  that have not yet been  specifically
identified. We anticipate we will receive up to $50 million in proceeds from the
sale of  investment  properties  during the next 12 months.  We intend to invest
these proceeds into new retail property acquisitions.


PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.  We paid preferred stock dividends of $9.7 million in
both 2001 and 2000.


NET INCOME  AVAILABLE TO COMMON  STOCKHOLDERS in 2001 increased by $12.7 million
to $57.8 million versus $45.1 million in 2000.

The  calculation  to  determine  net  income  available  to common  stockholders
includes gains and losses from the sale of investment properties.  The amount of
gains and losses varies from year to year based on the timing of property  sales
and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.


THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON  OF OUR RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999.

RENTAL  REVENUE was $117.2  million for 2000 versus $104.3  million for 1999, an
increase  of $12.9  million,  or  12.4%.  The  increase  in rental  revenue  was
primarily due to the  acquisition  of 110 properties in 1999.  These  properties
generated  revenue of $15.4 million in 2000 compared to $6.9 million in 1999, an
increase of $8.5  million.  Included in rental  revenue for 2000 is $1.2 million
from properties owned by Crest Net.

Percentage rent,  which is included in rental revenue,  was $2.0 million in 2000
and $1.7 million in 1999.  Same store rents  generated on 894 leased  properties
owned during all of both 2000 and 1999  increased  by $1.5  million or 1.7%,  to
$91.0 million from $89.5 million.


GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE  ACQUIRED FOR RESALE.  In 2000,  Crest Net sold two
properties  for $6.2 million and we  recognized a gain on the sales of $766,000,
before income taxes. Crest Net was formed in 2000.







INTEREST EXPENSE.  The following is a summary of the five components of interest
expense for 2000 and 1999 (dollars in thousands):


Interest on outstanding  loans and notes was $6.0 million higher in 2000 than in
1999  primarily due to an increase of $59.4  million in the average  outstanding
balances and an increase of 41 basis points in our average  interest  rate.  The
average  borrowing rate on our credit  facilities  during 2000 was 7.67%, or 150
basis points higher than our average  borrowing  rate during 1999.  During 2000,
LIBOR  increased,  which  increased  the  average  borrowing  rate on our credit
facilities.

Our debt service  coverage  ratio for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999
was 3.5 times and 3.9 times, respectively. Our EBITDA (as defined above) for the
years ended  December  31, 2000 and 1999 was $109.4  million and $96.2  million,
respectively.  Our fixed  coverage ratio for 2000 was 2.7 times and for 1999 was
3.2 times.


DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION was $29.0 million in 2000 versus $26.0 million in
1999.  The  increase  in 2000  was  primarily  due to the  full-year  effect  of
depreciation on the properties acquired in 1999.


GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  increased  by $301,000 to $6.8 million in
2000  versus $6.5  million in 1999.  General  and  administrative  expenses as a
percentage  of revenue  decreased  to 5.8% in 2000 as  compared to 6.3% in 1999.
Included  in  general  and  administrative  expenses  for 2000 are  $305,000  of
expenses attributable to Crest Net.


PROPERTY  EXPENSES  were $2.0  million  in 2000 and $1.8  million  in 1999.  The
$210,000  increase  in  property  expenses is  primarily  attributable  to costs
associated with properties available for lease.







OTHER  EXPENSES were $813,000 in 2000 and $430,000 in 1999. The increase in 2000
is  primarily  attributable  to Crest  Net  state and  federal  income  taxes of
$332,000.  The following is a summary of our other  expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 (dollars in thousands):



NO PROVISION FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSS was recorded in 2000 or 1999.


GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENT  PROPERTIES.  In 2000,  we sold 21 properties  for a
total of $45.2 million and recognized a gain of $6.7 million. Included in the 21
properties sold in 2000, are two properties leased by one of our tenants that we
exchanged,  valued  at $22.7  million,  for two other  properties  owned by that
tenant. In 1999, we sold three properties for $9.4 million and recognized a gain
of $1.3 million.


EXTRAORDINARY LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF CREDIT FACILITY. In December 1999,
our $170 million credit facility was canceled  simultaneously with the execution
of our $200 million credit facility and unamortized fees of $355,000 relating to
the $170 million credit facility were recorded as an  extraordinary  loss on the
early extinguishment of the credit facility in 1999.


PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.  We paid preferred stock dividends of $9.7 million in
2000 and $5.2 million in 1999. Our outstanding preferred stock was issued during
the second and third quarters of 1999.


NET INCOME  AVAILABLE TO COMMON  STOCKHOLDERS in 2000 increased  10.0%, to $45.1
million versus $41.0 million in 1999.


                               IMPACT OF INFLATION

Tenant  leases  generally  provide for limited  increases in rent as a result of
increases in the tenants' sales volumes,  increases in the consumer price index,
and/or  fixed  increases.  We expect  that  inflation  will  cause  these  lease
provisions to result in increases in rent over time. During times when inflation
is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases,  rent increases
may not keep up with the rate of inflation.

Approximately 97.8% or 1,099 of the 1,124 properties in the portfolio are leased
to tenants under net leases whereby the tenant is responsible for property costs
and  expenses.  These lease  features  reduce our  exposure  to rising  property
expenses due to inflation.  Inflation  and  increased  costs may have an adverse
impact on our tenants if increases in their operating  expenses exceed increases
in revenue.







                       IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
No. 141,  Business  Combinations.  Statement  No. 141 requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations  initiated after June
30, 2001.  The Company  adopted the provisions of Statement No. 141 in 2001. The
adoption of  Statement  No. 141 has not had a material  effect on our  financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

In June 2001, the FASB issued  Statement No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.  Statement  No. 142 requires that  goodwill and  intangible  assets with
indefinite  useful  lives  no  longer  be  amortized,  but  instead  tested  for
impairment at least annually in accordance  with the provisions of Statement No.
142. Statement No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite useful
lives  be  amortized  over  their  respective  estimated  useful  lives to their
estimated  residual values,  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 121,  Accounting for the  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.

The Company adopted  Statement No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. At the date of
adoption,  the Company had unamortized  goodwill in the amount of $17.2 million.
The  Company  does  not have  any  intangible  assets  or  unamortized  negative
goodwill.  Amortization expense related to goodwill was $924,000 for each of the
years 2001,  2000 and 1999. We have not yet  determined  the impact of Statement
No. 142 on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  Effective January 1, 2002,  Statement No. 144
superseded Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for  Long-Lived  Assets  to be  Disposed  Of.  Statement  No.  144  requires
long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of to be  measured  at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell. We anticipate  our adoption of Statement
No. 144 will not have a material  effect on our financial  position,  results of
operations or liquidity.


ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
         ----------------------------------------------------------

We are  exposed to interest  rate  changes  primarily  as a result of our credit
facilities  and long-term  notes used to maintain  liquidity and expand our real
estate  investment  portfolio and operations.  Our interest rate risk management
objective  is to limit the impact of interest  rate changes on earnings and cash
flow and to lower our overall  borrowing  costs.  To achieve our  objectives  we
borrow  long-term debt primarily at fixed rates and may  selectively  enter into
derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements, interest
rate swaps and caps in order to  mitigate  our  interest  rate risk on a related
financial  instrument.   We  were  not  a  party  to  any  derivative  financial
instruments  at December 31, 2001. We do not enter,  and have not entered,  into
any transactions for speculative or trading purposes.






Our interest  rate risk is monitored  using a variety of  techniques.  The table
below presents the principal  amounts,  weighted  average  interest rates,  fair
values and other terms  required by year of  expected  maturity to evaluate  the
expected cash flows and  sensitivity to interest rate changes  (dollars in table
in millions):

The table  incorporates only those exposures that exist at December 31, 2001; it
does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
As a result,  our ultimate  realized  gain or loss with respect to interest rate
fluctuations  would depend on the  exposures  that arise during the period,  our
hedging strategies at the time and interest rates.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Realty Income Corporation:


We  have  audited  the  consolidated   financial  statements  of  Realty  Income
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying table of contents. In
connection with our audits of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  we also
have audited the  financial  statement  schedule III listed in the  accompanying
table  of  contents.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial
statement  schedule are the  responsibility  of the  Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial  position of Realty  Income
Corporation  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period  ended  December 31,  2001,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States of America.  Also in our opinion,  the
related  financial  statement  schedule III, when  considered in relation to the
basic consolidated  financial  statements taken as a whole,  presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                   REALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   ------------------------------------------
                        December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999


1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION

Realty Income  Corporation  ("Realty  Income," the "Company,"  "we" or "our") is
organized as a Maryland corporation.  We invest in commercial retail real estate
and have  elected to be taxed as a real estate  investment  trust  ("REIT").  At
December 31, 2001, we owned 1,124  properties in 48 states  containing  over 9.6
million  leasable square feet,  excluding 24 properties owned by our subsidiary,
Crest Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest Net").


2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest Net and other entities for which we
make operational and financial  decisions  (control),  after  elimination of all
material intercompany balances and transactions.

Cash  Equivalents - We consider all short-term,  highly liquid  investments that
are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Depreciation  and  Amortization - Depreciation of buildings and improvements and
amortization  of goodwill are computed  using the  straight-line  method over an
estimated  useful life of 25 years.  Amortization  of  goodwill  for each of the
years  2001,  2000 and 1999  was  $924,000.  In  accordance  with the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board Statement No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible
Assets,"  effective January 2002, our goodwill will no longer be amortized,  but
instead will be tested for impairment at least annually.

Leases - All leases are  accounted for as operating  leases.  Under this method,
lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease
term  regardless  of when the  payments are due. We  recognize  contingent  rent
revenue  from  tenants  only after the tenants  exceed  their sales  breakpoint.
Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indexes are recognized
only after the changes in the indexes have occurred,  and then applied according
to the lease agreements.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements" ("SAB 101"). SAB
101 reflects the basic principles of revenue  recognition in existing accounting
principles  generally  accepted in the United  States of America  ("U.S.").  The
Company adopted SAB 101 in the first quarter of 2000, which had no effect on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Federal  Income Taxes - We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended  ("IRS  Code").  We believe  Realty Income has
qualified and continues to qualify as a REIT and therefore  will be permitted to
deduct distributions paid to its stockholders,  eliminating the federal taxation
of  income   represented  by  those   distributions   at  the  Company's  level.
Accordingly,  no  provision  has  been  made  for  federal  income  taxes in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements,  except for federal income taxes
of Crest  Net,  which  totaled  $1.2  million  and  $264,000  in 2001 and  2000,
respectively, and are included in other expenses.





Earnings and  profits,  which  determine  the  taxability  of  distributions  to
stockholders,  differ from net income reported for financial  reporting purposes
due to  differences  for IRS Code  purposes in the  estimated  useful  lives and
methods  used to compute  depreciation  and the  carrying  value  (basis) on the
investments in properties, among other things.

The following  reconciles  our net income  available to common  stockholders  to
taxable  income for the year ended  December  31, 2001  (dollars  in  thousands)
(unaudited):

Net income available to common stockholders                            $ 57,846
Tax gain on sale of real estate less than book gain                     (12,734)
Dividends received from Crest Net                                         2,500
Elimination of net revenue and expenses from Crest Net                   (3,314)
Preferred dividends not deductible for tax                                9,712
Depreciation and amortization timing differences                          9,951
Impairment losses                                                         1,450
Other adjustments                                                          (617)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Estimated taxable net income                                           $ 64,794
================================================================================

Maintenance and Repairs - Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. Replacements and betterments are capitalized.

Provision  for  Impairment  Losses  - We  review  long-lived  assets,  including
goodwill,  for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that the  carrying  amount  of an asset  may not be  recoverable.  Generally,  a
provision is made for impairment loss if estimated  future  operating cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated  disposition proceeds
(undiscounted) are less than the current book value. Impairment loss is measured
as the  amount by which the  current  book value of the asset  exceeds  the fair
value of the asset.  If a property is held for sale,  it is carried at the lower
of cost or estimated fair value,  less costs to sell. A provision for impairment
losses of $1.45 million was recorded in 2001. No provision for  impairment  loss
was recorded in 2000 or 1999.

Net Income Per Common  Share - Basic net income per common  share is computed by
dividing net income  available to common  stockholders  by the weighted  average
number of common shares outstanding  during each period.  Diluted net income per
common  share is  computed  by dividing  the amount of net income  available  to
common  stockholders  for the period by the number of common  shares  that would
have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per
common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common
share computation, for the years ended December 31:






In 2001,  no stock  options were  anti-dilutive.  In 2000 and 1999,  296,653 and
186,181 stock options,  respectively,  were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded
from the incremental shares from the assumed exercise of stock options.

Stock Option Plan - We account for our stock option plan in accordance  with the
provisions of Accounting  Principles  Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting
for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related   interpretations.   As  such,
compensation  expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current
market price of the underlying  stock exceeded the exercise price.  Statement of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation"  ("SFAS No. 123"),  permits  entities to recognize as expense over
the  vesting  period,  the fair value of all  stock-based  awards on the date of
grant.  Alternatively,  SFAS No. 123 allows  entities  to  continue to apply the
provisions  of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma
income per share  disclosures  for employee stock option grants made after 1994,
as if the fair-value  based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.  We
have  elected to  continue  to apply the  provisions  of APB  Opinion No. 25 and
provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Derivative Financial  Instruments - In two instances,  in 1996 and 1998, we used
interest rate treasury lock  agreements to protect  against the  possibility  of
rising  interest  rates.  These  instruments  each met the requirement for hedge
accounting, including a high correlation to a specific transaction. Accordingly,
the amount  received and paid under the terms of the agreements is recognized in
income as a yield adjustment to interest expense.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of the consolidated  financial  statements in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the U.S. requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the  financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenue and
expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from those
estimates.

Management  believes that the estimates and assumptions  that are most important
to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations,
in  that  they  require  management's  most  difficult,  subjective  or  complex
judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical
to the Company.  These critical  accounting policies relate to depreciable lives
of our real estate  assets and  recoverability  (impairment)  of our real estate
assets.  We believe our  estimates  and  assumptions  related to these  critical
accounting  policies are appropriate under the  circumstances;  however,  should
future events or occurrences result in unanticipated  consequences,  there could
be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.


3. INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY

In January  2000, we acquired 95% of the common stock of Crest Net, all of which
is  non-voting,  and certain  members of our management and Crest Net management
acquired 5% of the common stock,  all of which is voting stock.  In May 2001, we
acquired  the 5% of common  stock of Crest Net owned by  certain  members of our
management and management of Crest Net for $507,000.  The  acquisition of the 5%
of common stock was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. After
this  transaction,  Realty Income owns 100% of the stock of Crest Net. Crest Net
was  created  to  buy,  own and  sell  properties,  primarily  to  buyers  using
tax-deferred exchanges, under Section 1031 of the IRS Code.

At December  31, 2001 and 2000,  investments  in  properties  owned by Crest Net
totaled $22.3 million and $23.1 million,  respectively, and are included in real
estate held for sale, net in our consolidated balance sheets.





4. CREDIT FACILITIES

A. In  December  1999,  we entered  into a $200  million,  revolving,  unsecured
acquisition  credit  facility  that expires in December  2003.  The $200 million
credit  facility  is with The Bank of New York,  as  administrative  agent,  and
several U.S. and non-U.S.  banks. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the outstanding
balances  on the  acquisition  credit  facility  were $63.7  million  and $149.9
million, respectively, with an effective interest rate of approximately 3.1% and
7.8%, respectively. The $200 million credit facility currently bears interest at
1.225% over the London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  ("LIBOR")  and offers us other
interest rate  options.  A facility fee of 0.225% per annum accrues on the total
commitment of the credit facility.

In December  1999,  our  previous  $170  million  credit  facility  was canceled
simultaneously  with the  execution of the $200  million  credit  facility,  and
unamortized  fees of $355,000  relating to our $170 million credit facility were
recorded  as an  extraordinary  loss  on  early  extinguishment  of  the  credit
facility.

B. In February  2000,  we entered  into a $25  million,  three-year,  revolving,
unsecured credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal,  which expires in February
2003.  At December  31, 2001 and 2000,  the  outstanding  balances on the credit
facility were $21.6 million and $24.1 million,  respectively,  with an effective
interest  rate of  approximately  3.2% and 7.9%,  respectively.  The $25 million
credit  facility  bears  interest at 1.225% over LIBOR. A facility fee of 0.225%
per annum accrues on the total commitment of the credit facility.

C. The average  borrowing rate on our credit  facilities during 2001 was 6.4% or
130 basis points lower than our average  borrowing rate during 2000 of 7.7%. Our
credit  facilities are subject to various  leverage and interest  coverage ratio
limitations. The Company is and has been in compliance with these covenants.

D. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, interest of $385,000,  $1.0 million and $1.6 million,
respectively, was capitalized with respect to properties under development.


5. NOTES PAYABLE

In January  1999, we issued $20 million of 8.0% senior notes due 2009 (the "1999
Notes").  The 1999 Notes are  unsecured and were sold at 98.757% of par to yield
8.1%. Interest on the 1999 Notes is payable semiannually.

In October 1998, we issued $100 million of 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes due
2008 (the  "1998  Notes").  The 1998  Notes are  unsecured  and were sold at par
($25.00).  In May 1998, we entered into a treasury  interest rate lock agreement
associated  with the 1998  Notes.  In  settlement  of the  agreement,  we made a
payment of $8.7 million in October  1998.  The payment on the agreement is being
amortized  over 10 years (the life of the 1998 Notes) as a yield  adjustment  to
interest  expense.  After taking into effect the results of a treasury  interest
rate  lock  agreement,  the  effective  rate to us on the 1998  Notes is  9.12%.
Interest on the 1998 Notes is payable monthly.

In May 1997,  we issued $110  million of 7.75%  senior notes due 2007 (the "1997
Notes").  The 1997 Notes are  unsecured and were sold at 99.929% of par to yield
7.76%. In December 1996, we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement
associated with the 1997 Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we received $1.1
million in June 1997. The payment  received on the agreement is being  amortized
over 10 years (the life of the 1997  Notes) as a yield  adjustment  to  interest
expense.  After taking into effect the results of a treasury  interest rate lock
agreement,  the  effective  interest  rate to us on the  1997  Notes  is  7.62%.
Interest on the 1997 Notes is payable semiannually.

Interest incurred on the 1999 Notes, 1998 Notes and 1997 Notes  collectively for
the years  ended  December  31,  2001,  2000 and 1999 was $18.4  million,  $18.4
million and $18.3 million, respectively.

11. OPERATING LEASES

A.  General - At December  31,  2001,  we owned 1,124  properties  in 48 states,
excluding  properties owned by Crest Net. Of these 1,124  properties,  1,119 are
single-tenant  and the  remainder  are  multi-tenant.  At December 31, 2001,  20
properties were vacant and available for lease or sale.

Substantially  all leases are net leases  whereby the tenant pays property taxes
and assessments,  maintains the interior and exterior of the building and leased
premises, and carries insurance coverage for public liability,  property damage,
fire and extended coverage.

Percentage rent for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1.7 million,  $2.0 million and $1.7
million, respectively.

At December  31,  2001,  minimum  annual  rents to be received on the  operating
leases are as follows (dollars in thousands):


B. Major Tenants - The following  schedule  presents rental  revenue,  including
percentage rents,  from tenants  representing more than 10% of our total revenue
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 or 1999 (dollars in thousands):

Tenants                                      2001              2000         1999
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Children's World Learning Centers, Inc.   $14,830           $14,698      $14,371
La Petite Academy, Inc.                    -- (1)            12,233       10,730

(1) Rental revenue from La Petite Academy, Inc. represented less than 10% of our
total revenue for 2001.

12. GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE ACQUIRED FOR RESALE

In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties for $28.9 million.  We recognized a gain
of $3.4 million on the sales of these properties.

In 2000, Crest Net sold two properties for $6.2 million. We recognized a gain of
$766,000 on the sales of these properties.





13. GAIN ON SALES OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES

In 2001, we sold 35 properties  for $39.5 million and recognized a gain of $10.5
million.

In 2000, we sold or exchanged 21 properties  for $45.2 million and  recognized a
gain of $6.7 million.  Included in the 21 properties were two properties  leased
by one of our tenants that we exchanged for two other  properties  owned by that
tenant for no gain (see note 15B).

In 1999, we sold three properties for $9.4 million and recognized a gain of $1.3
million.


14. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe that the carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets
at December 31, 2001 and 2000  reasonably  approximate  the fair values for cash
and cash equivalents,  accounts  receivable,  and all liabilities,  due to their
short-term  nature,  except for lines of credit  payable and notes  payable.  In
making  these  assessments,  we used  estimates.  The fair value of the lines of
credit payable  approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to
those  available  in the market  place.  The fair value of the notes  payable at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 is estimated to be $230.1 million and $212.2 million,
respectively,  based upon the closing market price per note or indicative  price
per each note at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.


15. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $25.3 million,  $29.8 million and $22.4
million, respectively.

The following  non-cash  investing and financing  activities are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):

A. Additions to properties resulted in the following:

                                                              2001          1999
                                                              ----          ----
             Buildings                                        $421        $9,057
             Real estate held for sale, net                    183            --
             Other liabilities                                 604         9,057

B. In 2000,  we exchanged  two  properties  leased by one of our tenants for two
other properties owned by that tenant, which resulted in the following:

         Land                                              $(2,031)
         Buildings                                           1,386
         Accumulated depreciation                              645

C. In 2001,  the  acquisition of the 5% of Crest Net common stock not previously
owned by Realty Income resulted in the following:

         Accounts receivable                                $ (450)
         Accounts payable and accrued expenses                (450)





D. In 2001,  we  reclassified  unamortized  amounts of  restricted  stock grants
included in other assets to deferred stock compensation (reported as a component
of common stock and paid in capital), which resulted in the following:

         Other assets                                       $ (376)
         Deferred stock compensation                           376

E. Restricted stock grants resulted in the following:



F. Restricted stock forfeitures resulted in the following:


16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

We have a 401(k) plan covering  substantially  all of our  employees.  Under our
401(k)  plan,  employees  may  elect to make  contributions  to the plan up to a
maximum of 15% of their  compensation,  subject to limits under the IRS Code. We
match  50%  of  our  employee's  contributions,  up  to  3%  of  the  employee's
compensation. Our aggregate matching contributions each year has been immaterial
to our results of operations.


17. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

In 1993,  our Board of  Directors  approved a stock  incentive  plan (the "Stock
Plan") designed to attract and retain  directors,  officers and employees of the
Company by enabling  those  individuals  to  participate in the ownership of the
Company.  The Stock Plan  authorizes the issuance in each calendar year of up to
3% of the total  shares  outstanding  at the end of such  year.  The Stock  Plan
provides for grants of up to 1,950,308  shares.  The Stock Plan provides for the
award  (subject to  ownership  limitations)  of a broad  variety of  stock-based
compensation  alternatives such as nonqualified  stock options,  incentive stock
options, restricted stock and performance awards.

Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock's
fair market value at the date of grant.  Stock options  expire 10 years from the
date they are granted and vest over service periods of one, three, four and five
years.

In 2001,  2000 and 1999, the Company  issued 61,500,  17,800 and 5,600 shares of
restricted stock, respectively, which vest over periods ranging from three years
to ten years.  The weighted  average fair market values of the restricted  stock
issued in 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $25.43, $21.15 and $24.85, respectively.





The following  table  summarizes  our stock option  activity for the years 2001,
2000 and 1999:


At December 31, 2001, the options  exercisable under the Stock Plan had exercise
prices  ranging from $20.00 to $26.06 with a weighted  average  price of $23.29,
and  expiration  dates ranging from August 2004 to February 2010 with a weighted
average remaining term of 6.4 years.

The fair value of each stock  option  grant was  estimated  at the date of grant
using the binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:



We apply APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting  for the Stock Plan and,  accordingly,
no  compensation  cost  has  been  recognized  for  our  stock  options  in  the
consolidated financial statements.  Had we determined compensation cost based on
the fair value at the grant date for its stock  options  under SFAS No. 123, our
net income  available to common  stockholders  and diluted net income per common
share would have been as follows:






18. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

In 1998, our Board of Directors  adopted a Stockholder  Rights Plan (the "Rights
Plan")  that will  expire in July 2008.  The Rights  Plan  assigns  one right (a
"Right")  to  purchase  one  one-hundredth  (1/100th)  of a share of our Class A
Junior Participating  Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, for each share
of common stock owned on or issued after July 1, 1998. Currently, the Rights are
not exercisable and do not trade separately from our common stock.

Under  specified  circumstances,  stockholders  will be able to  exercise  their
Rights if a person or group  acquires  15% of our common stock or makes a tender
offer to  acquire  15% or more of our  common  stock.  In  these  circumstances,
stockholders  other than the  acquirer  would be able to exercise  the Rights to
purchase our common stock or, in some situations,  the acquirer's stock at a 50%
discount.


19. SEGMENT INFORMATION

We evaluate  performance and make resource allocation decisions on a property by
property basis. For financial  reporting  purposes,  we have grouped our tenants
into 11 reportable  segments  based upon the business the tenants are in, except
for properties  owned by Crest Net that are grouped in a separate  segment.  The
Crest Net  segment is included in "other  non-reportable  segments."  All of the
properties are incorporated into one of the applicable segments.  Revenue is the
only component of segment profit and loss we measure. The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in note 2.

The following  tables set forth  certain  information  regarding the  properties
owned by us, classified  according to the business of the respective  tenants as
of December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands):







20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary  course of our  business,  we are party to various legal actions
which we believe are routine in nature and  incidental  to the  operation of our
business.  We  believe  that  the  outcome  of the  proceedings  will not have a
material adverse effect upon our consolidated statements taken as a whole.


21. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In February 2002, we issued 273,150 shares of common stock to a unit  investment
trust at a net price to us of $30.26 per share,  based on a 5%  discount  to the
market  price at the time of issuance of $31.85 per share.  The net  proceeds of
$8.2 million were used to repay bank borrowings.
