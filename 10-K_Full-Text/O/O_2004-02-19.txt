PART I

Item 1:

Business

THE
COMPANY

Realty Income
Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

,
is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate
investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT.  Our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly
cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from
operations, or FFO, per share.  Over the
past 35 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and
owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under
long-term (primarily 15- to 20-year) lease agreements.  The monthly distributions are supported by
the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and
national retail chains.

We
are a fully integrated, self-administered, real estate company with in-house
acquisition, leasing, legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio
management and capital markets expertise.

We seek to increase
distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio
management and the acquisition of additional properties.  Our portfolio management focus includes:

•

Contractual
rent increases on existing leases;

•

Rent
increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit;
and

•

The
active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing of vacant
properties and selective sales of properties.

Our acquisition of
additional properties adheres to a focused strategy of primarily acquiring
properties that are:

•

Freestanding,
single-tenant, retail locations;

•

Leased
to regional and national retail chains; and

•

Leased
under long-term, net-lease agreements.

At December 31, 2003, we
owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,404 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.1%, or 1,378 properties occupied of the 1,404
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 85 different retail chains doing business in 28 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 11.3 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 8,100 square feet.

Of the 1,404 properties
in the portfolio, 1,399, or 99.6%, are single-tenant, retail properties and the
remaining five are multi-tenant properties. 
At December 31, 2003, 1,374, or 98.2%, of the 1,399 single-tenant
properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding
extension options) of approximately 11.8 years.

In addition to our real
estate portfolio, at December 31, 2003, our wholly-owned subsidiary Crest Net
Lease, Inc. owned 37 properties totaling $53.3 million.  These properties are held for sale.

We typically acquire
retail store properties under long-term leases with retail chain store
operators. These transactions provide capital to the operators for continued
expansion and other corporate purposes. 
Our acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in well-defined
target markets and generally focus on middle-market retailers providing goods
and services that satisfy basic consumer needs.


Our net-lease agreements
generally:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses (taxes,
insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on increases in
the consumer price index, fixed increases, or additional rent calculated as a
percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.

Realty Income commenced
operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25 public and
private real estate limited partnerships with and into the Company.  Each of the partnerships was formed between
1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased
properties.

The six senior officers
of Realty Income owned 1.1% of our outstanding common stock with a market value
of $18.2 million at February 16, 2004. 
The directors and six senior officers of Realty Income, as a group,
owned 2.7% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of
$44.1 million at February 16, 2004.

Realty Income’s common
stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol
“O.”  Our central index key number is
726728 and cusip number is 756109-104.

Realty Income’s Class B
cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OprB” and its cusip number is 756109-302.

Realty Income’s Class C
cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OprC” and its cusip number is 756109-500.

Realty Income’s 8.25%
Monthly Income Senior Notes, due 2008 are listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OUI.”  The cusip number of these
notes is 756109-203.

Realty Income had 58
employees as of February 16, 2004.

We maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website
we make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

The Acquisition of 86 National Tire and Battery Properties.

In November 2003, Realty
Income and Crest Net provided an aggregate of $135.7 million in sale leaseback
financing to TBC Corporation by acquiring 86 National Tire and Battery (“NTB”)
retail tire store locations.  Of the
$135.7 million, $109.3 million in properties was acquired by Realty Income
and $26.4 million in properties was acquired by Crest Net.  These locations were acquired under 20-year,
net lease agreements.  Each store has an
average of 10,500 leasable square feet on an average lot size of 1.2 acres and
was purchased for an average cost of $1.6 million.  The properties are generally in desirable
retail locations near major retail centers, located on high traffic
thoroughfares. In addition, the properties acquired are primarily existing,
seasoned, retail tire store locations with profitable operating histories.


Credit Ratings Upgrades.

In November 2003, our credit
ratings were upgraded by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Group.  Our senior unsecured debt rating was raised
to BBB from BBB- and our preferred stock rating was raised to BBB- from BB+,
with a stable outlook.

In February 2003, our credit
ratings were upgraded by Moody’s Investors Service.  Our senior unsecured debt rating was raised to Baa2 from Baa3-
and our preferred stock rating was raised to Baa3- from Ba1, with a stable
outlook.

Issuance of 12-Year, 5-1/2% Senior Unsecured Notes.

In November 2003, we issued
$150 million of 12-year, 5-1/2% senior unsecured notes due in 2015.  The price to the investor for the notes was
99.508% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.56%. These
securities have been rated BBB by Fitch Ratings, Baa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group.  The net proceeds from the sale of the notes
were used to fund the NTB portfolio acquisition for $135.7 million and to
repay borrowings under our $250 million unsecured acquisition credit
facility.

The Acquisition of 114 Pantry Convenience Store Properties.

In October 2003, Realty
Income and Crest Net acquired a portfolio of 114 convenience store properties
from The Pantry, Inc. for $94.5 million. Of the $94.5 million, $69.5
million in properties was acquired by Realty Income and $25 million was
acquired by Crest Net.  The properties
were purchased subject to 20-year, net-lease agreements. The stores are, on
average, approximately 2,700 leasable square feet and have an average 14-year operating
history.

Issuance of Common Stock.

In October 2003, we issued
2,875,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $40.59 per
share.  The net proceeds from this
offering were approximately $110.8 million and were used to repay borrowings
under our $250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility.

Issuance of 10-Year, 5-3/8% Senior Unsecured Notes.

In March 2003, we issued
$100 million of 10-year, 5-3/8% senior unsecured notes due in 2013.  The price to the investor for the notes was
99.509% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.439%. These
securities are rated BBB by Fitch Ratings, Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and BBB by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group.  The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings
under our $250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility.

Acquisitions during 2003.

Realty Income and Crest Net
Aggregate Acquisitions.

Realty Income and Crest
Net invested $371.6 million in aggregate in 302 new properties and properties under
development in 2003.  These 302
properties are located in 25 states and are 100% leased with an initial average
lease term of 19.9 years.

Realty Income.

Realty Income invested
$284.0 million during 2003 in 242 new properties and properties under development
with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.8%.  These 242 properties are located in 20
states and are 100% leased with an initial average lease term of 19.9 years and
will contain approximately 1.5 million leasable square feet.


Of the $284.0 million
Realty Income invested in real estate during 2003, $13.1 million was
invested in properties under development during 2003 that were acquired before
2003.  Estimated unfunded development
costs on Realty Income and Crest Net properties under development at
December 31, 2003 totaled $8.3 million.  At Dec

ember

31,
2003, eight new properties acquired during 2003 were leased and under
development, pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop
the properties (with development costs funded by Realty Income or Crest Net)
with rent scheduled to begin at various times during first nine months of 2004.

The initial weighted
average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net
operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the base rent or,
in the case of

properties

under development, the estimated base rent under the lease) for the first year
of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment
of contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

The 242 new properties
acquired by Realty Income are net-leased to 15 different retail chains in 10
industries: automotive collision service, automotive service, automotive tire
service, convenience store, equipment rental service, grocery store, home
improvement, restaurant, sporting goods and travel plaza.  During 2003, we added two new industries to
our portfolio, they are equipment rental service and travel plaza.  We also segregated the automotive tire
service industry from the automotive parts industry.  This segregation was made because the two industries have
different economic characteristics.

Crest Net.

Crest Net invested $87.6
million during 2003 in 60 new retail properties and properties under
development.

Investments in Existing
Properties.

In 2003, we capitalized
costs of $656,000 on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of
$392,000 for re-leasing costs and $264,000 for building improvements.

Net Income Available to Common
Stockholders.

Net
income available to common stockholders was $76.7 million in 2003 versus
$69.0 million in 2002, an increase of $7.7 million.  On a diluted per common share basis, net
income was $2.15 per share in 2003 as compared to $2.03 per share in 2002.

The calculation to determine net income available to
common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment
properties.  The amount of gains and
losses varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and
can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment
properties during 2003 was $6.5 million as compared to $6.3 million during
2002.

Funds from Operations (FFO).

In 2003, our FFO
increased by $10.3 million, or 11.0%, to $104.0 million versus
$93.7 million in 2002.  See our
discussion of FFO in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which
includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to
FFO.

In 2003, Crest Net
generated $4.6 million in FFO for Realty Income.  The future contribution, if any, to our FFO by Crest Net will
depend on the timing and the number of property acquisitions and sales it
achieves, if any, in a given year.


Crest Net Property Sales.

During
2003 Crest Net sold 27 properties from its inventory for $45.2 million, which
resulted in a gain of $6.2 million.

Crest Net’s Property Inventory.

Crest
Net’s property inventory at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 totaled
$53.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and is included in real
estate held for sale, net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The financial statements
of Crest Net are consolidated into Realty Income’s financial statements.  All material intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Sales of Investment Properties by Realty
Income.

During 2003, we sold 35
properties and exchanged excess land parcels from three properties for an
aggregate of $23.1 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.5 million. The
35 properties sold consisted of 19 child care facilities, nine restaurants,
three home improvement stores, two auto service location, one consumer
electronics store and one other property. 
The land exchanges were on three convenience store locations.  These gains are included in discontinued
operations.  The net proceeds from the
sale of these properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our
credit facility and to invest in new properties.

Increases in Monthly
Distributions to Common Stockholders.

We continue our 34-year
policy of paying distributions monthly. 
Monthly distributions per share were increased by $0.00125 on four
separate occasions.  In April 2003 the
monthly distribution increase per share was to $0.19625, in July 2003 to
$0.1975, in October 2003 to $0.19875 and in January 2004 to $0.20.  The increase in January 2004 was our 25

th

consecutive quarterly increase and the 27

th

increase in the amount
of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.  In 2003, we paid 12 monthly cash
distributions per share; three in the amount of $0.195, three in the amount of
$0.19625, three in the amount of $0.1975, and three in the amount of $0.19875,
totaling $2.3625 per share.  In December
2003, January 2004 and February 2004, we declared distributions of $0.20 per
share, which were paid on January 15, 2004, February 17, 2004 and will be
paid on March 15, 2004, respectively.

The monthly distribution
of $0.20 per share represents a current annualized distribution of
$2.40 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately
5.6% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of
$42.85 on February 13, 2004. 
Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly
distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of
distributions, that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions
per share, or what the actual distribution yield will be in any future period.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Distributions
are paid to our common stockholders and Class C preferred stockholders on a
monthly basis and are paid to our Class B preferred stockholders on a quarterly
basis if, as and when declared by our Board of Directors.  The Class B preferred stockholders receive
cumulative distributions at a rate of 9.375% per annum on the $25 per share
liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.34375 per annum per share).  The Class C preferred stockholders receive
cumulative distributions at a rate of 9.5% per annum on the $25 per share
liquidation preference (equivalent to $2.375 per annum per share).

In
order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating
annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains) and we are
subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains). 
In 2003, our distributions totaled approximately 108.1% of our estimated
REIT taxable income.


Our
estimated REIT taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and
amortization.  We intend to continue to
make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this
distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income
taxes.  Our 2003 distributions to common
stockholders were 80.6% of our funds from operations available to common
stockholders.

Future distributions
will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among
other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from operations,
financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, our debt service requirements and any other factors the Board of
Directors may deem relevant.  In
addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the
amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our
results of operations or financial condition, and which prohibit the payment of
distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay
when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on
borrowings under our credit facility.

Distributions of our
current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes,
generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the
extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or
such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate
of tax.  The maximum tax rate of
non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” has generally been
reduced from 38.6% to 15% (for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2002).  In general, dividends payable by
REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends, except
to the extent the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from
taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net), to
income that was subject to tax at the corporate/REIT level (for example, if we
distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable
year) or, as discussed above, dividends properly designated by us as “capital
gain dividends.”  Distributions in
excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable
reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock.  Distributions above that basis, generally will be taxable as a
capital gain.  Approximately 6.4% of the
distributions, made or deemed to have been made in 2003, to our common
stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax
purposes.  We are unable to predict the
portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND
STRATEGY

Investment Philosophy.

We believe that the
long-term ownership of an actively managed, diversified portfolio of retail
properties, under long-term, net-lease agreements, produces consistent,
predictable income.  Under a net-lease
agreement, the tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating
expenses (taxes, maintenance and insurance) plus, typically, future rent
increases (generally subject to ceilings) based on increases in the consumer
price index, fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of
the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.  We believe that long-term leases, coupled with the tenant’s
responsibility for property expenses, generally produce a more predictable
income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing
to offer the potential for growth in rental income.

Investment Strategy.

In identifying new
properties for acquisition, our focus is on providing expansion capital to
retail chains by acquiring, then leasing back, their retail store
locations.  We categorize retail tenants
as: 1) venture market, 2) middle market, and 3) upper
market.  Venture companies typically
offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate
between five and 50 retail outlets.  Middle
market retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail outlets, operations in
more than one geographic region, have been successful through one or more
economic cycles, and have a proven, replicable concept.  The upper market retail chains typically
consist of companies with 500 or more stores, operating nationally, in a
proven, mature retail concept.  Upper
market retail chains generally have strong operating histories and access to
several sources of capital.


Realty Income primarily
focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we
believe are attractive for investment because:

•

They
generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that
can adversely affect venture retailers;

•

They
typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing
options;

•

They
generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time
since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as their
businesses have matured;

•

Their
relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater
number of stores; and

•

Middle
market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of
locations are closed due to underperformance.

We also focus on and
have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail
chains.  We believe upper market retail
chains can be attractive for investment because:

•

They
typically are of a higher credit quality;

•

They
usually are larger brand name, public and private retailers;

•

They
utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square feet;
and

•

They
are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction
sizes.

While our investment
strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper
market retail chains, we also selectively seek investment opportunities with
venture market retail chains. 
Periodically, venture market opportunities arise where we feel that the
real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can be purchased at
favorable prices.  To meet our stringent
investment standards, however, venture retail companies must have a
well-defined retailing concept and strong financial prospects.  These opportunities are examined on a case
by case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area.

Historically, our
investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component
because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more
stable.  Because of this investment focus,
for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, approximately 77% of our rental
revenue rent was derived from retailers with a service component in their
business.  Furthermore, we believe these
service-oriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the Internet
and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from
Internet businesses.

Credit Strategy.

We generally provide
sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade retail chains.  From 1970 through December 31, 2003, we have
acquired and leased back to regional and national retail chains 1,508
properties (including 151 properties that have been sold) and have collected
approximately 98% of the original contractual rent obligations on those
properties.  We believe that within this
market we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return on the financing we
provide to retailers.

We believe the principal
financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other
debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations.  Because we own the land and building in
which a tenant conducts its retail business, we believe the risk of default on
a retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general
obligations.  It has been our experience
that since retailers must retain their profitable retail locations in order to
survive, in the event of reorganization; they are less likely to reject a lease
for a profitable location, because this would terminate their right to use the
property.  Thus, as the property owner,
we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in
the event of reorganization.  If a
property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property
and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property.  In addition, we believe that the risk of
default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the
performance of the retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether
to sell locations that are weaker performers.


In order to qualify for
inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent
investment and credit requirements.  The
properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our
credit profile.  We have established a
three-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:

•

Industry,
company, market conditions and credit profile;

•

Location
profitability, if profitability data is available; and

•

Overall
real estate characteristics, including value and comparative rental rates.

The standard profile of
companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition, generally are
those with 50 or more retail stores that are located in highly visible areas,
with easy access to major thoroughfares and attractive demographics.

Acquisition Strategy.

We seek to invest in
industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national chains are
capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale,
mass media advertising and the selection of prime retail locations.  We execute our acquisition strategy by
acting as a source of capital to regional and national retail chain stores in a
variety of industries by acquiring then leasing back their retail store
locations.  We undertake thorough
research and analysis to identify appropriate industries, tenants and property
locations for investment.  Our research
expertise is instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets
where our real estate financing program adds value.  In selecting real estate for potential investment, we generally
seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics:

•

Freestanding,
commercially-zoned property with a single tenant;

•

Properties
that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains;

•

Properties
that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business
of their tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;
and

•

Properties
that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of
long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential
for rent increases.

Portfolio Management Strategy.

The active management of
the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term
strategy.  We continually monitor our
portfolio for changes that could affect the performance of the industries,
tenants and locations in which we have invested.  The portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing
its returns and enhancing its credit quality. 
Our executives review industry research, tenant research, property due
diligence and significant portfolio management activities.  This monitoring typically includes regular
review and analysis of:

•

The
performance of various retail industries;

•

The
operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the
tenants; and

•

The
health of the individual markets in which we own properties, from both an
economic and real estate viewpoint.

We have an active
portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we
believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio, or extend our average
remaining lease term.  At December 31,
2003, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $60.1 million as held
for sale, which includes $53.3 million in properties owned by Crest Net.  Additionally, we anticipate selling
properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically
identified.  We anticipate we will
receive between $15 million and $35 million in proceeds from the sale of
investment properties during the next 12 months and we intend to invest these
proceeds into new property acquisitions. 
However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the
next 12 months.


Conservative Capital Structure.

We believe our
stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure.  Therefore, we seek to maintain a
conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed
charge coverage ratios.  At
February 13, 2004, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding
notes were $493.0 million or approximately 22.2% of our total market
capitalization of $2.22 billion. 
We define our total market capitalization at February 13, 2004 as the
sum of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 38,006,034 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $42.85 per share, or $1.63
billion;

•

Liquidation
value of the Class B preferred stock of $68.6 million;

•

Liquidation
value of the Class C preferred stock of $34.5 million;

•

Outstanding
borrowings of $13.0 million on our credit facility; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $480.0 million.

We have a $250 million
revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2005.  At February 16, 2004, the outstanding
balance on the acquisition credit facility was $13.0 million, with an
effective interest rate of approximately 2.0%. 
A commitment fee of 0.2% per annum accrues on the total $250 million
credit commitment of the credit facility. 
The credit facility has been and is expected to be used to acquire
additional retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains
under long-term net-lease agreements. 
The credit facility has also been used to provide capital to
subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties.

We use our credit
facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions.  When outstanding borrowings under the credit
facility reach a certain level (generally in the range of $100 million to $150
million) and capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to
refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent
financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock,
convertible preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt securities.  We cannot assure you, however, that we will
be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions prevailing at
the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon
acceptable terms.

Historically, we have
met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock, preferred
stock and long-term unsecured notes. 
Over the long-term, we believe that the majority of our future
securities issuances should be in the form of common stock.  However, we may issue additional preferred
stock or debt securities from time to time. 
We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a
level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested
into additional properties.  In addition,
we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed
by our credit facility or debt securities. 
However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital
markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

We currently are
assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured
notes from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Group.  Currently, Fitch has
assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard
& Poor’s has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes.  These ratings could change based upon, among
other things, our results of operations and financial condition.

We also have received
credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock.  Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB-,
Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB-.  These ratings could change based upon, among other things, our
results of operations and financial condition.

We have no mortgage debt
on any of our properties.


No Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments.

Realty Income and its
subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in
“variable interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage
in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other
derivative instruments.

As we have no joint
ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock, our financial position or results of operations are currently not
affected by Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
both Liabilities and Equity.

Competitive Strategy.

We believe that to
successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we must seek to
maintain the following competitive advantages:

•

Size
and Type of Investment Properties:

We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000)
net-leased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in
today’s real estate environment.  Due to
the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively
small assets, we believe these types of properties have not experienced
significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield
reduction experienced by larger income-producing properties.  We believe the less intensive day-to-day
property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active
management of a large portfolio of smaller properties, is an effective
investment strategy.  The tenants of our
freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and services that
satisfy basic consumer needs.  In order
to grow and expand, they generally need capital.  Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single
largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers, our method of
purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease
arrangement, allows the retail chain to free up capital.

•

Investment
in New Retail Industries:

Though we specialize in single-tenant properties,
we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of retail
industries.  We believe diversification
will allow us to invest in retail industries that currently are growing and
have characteristics we find attractive. 
These characteristics include, but are not limited to, retail industries
that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national chain
store operators can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local
operators and streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major
demographic shifts in a population base.

•

Diversification:

Diversification of the portfolio by retail
industry type, tenant and geographic location is key to our objective of
providing predictable investment results for our stockholders. Further
diversification of our portfolio is an objective of ours.  At December 31, 2003, our retail property
portfolio consisted of 1,404 properties located in 48 states, leased to 85
retail chains doing business in 28 industry segments.  Each of the 28 industry segments represented in our property
portfolio individually accounted for less than 16.5% of our rental revenue for
the quarter ended December 31, 2003.

•

Management
Specialization:

We believe that our management’s specialization
in single-tenant retail properties, operated under net-lease agreements, is
important to meeting our objectives.  We
plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train
high-quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership,
finance and management.

•

Technology:

We intend to stay at the forefront of
technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our
operations.  We maintain sophisticated
information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and
actively manage our investments.  We
believe that technology and information-based systems will play an increasingly
important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of
capital to a variety of industries and tenants.


PROPERTIES

At December 31, 2003, we
owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,404 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.1%, or 1,378 properties occupied of the 1,404
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 85 different retail chains doing business in 28 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 11.3 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 8,100 square feet.

In addition to our real
estate portfolio at December 31, 2003, our subsidiary, Crest Net had invested
$53.3 million in a portfolio of 37 retail properties located in 13
states.  These properties are held for
sale.

At December 31, 2003,
1,374, or 97.9%, of our 1,404 retail properties were owned under net-lease
agreements.  Net leases typically
require the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property
operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance.  In addition, tenants are typically
responsible for future rent increases (generally subject to ceilings) based on
increases in the consumer price index, fixed increases or additional rent
calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.

Our net-leased retail
properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store
operators.  Most buildings are
single-story structures with adequate parking on site to accommodate peak
retail traffic periods.  The properties
tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts and
adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base to constitute a
suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s business.

business of the respective tenants, expressed as a percentage of our total
rental revenue:

Of the 1,404 properties
in the portfolio at December 31, 2003, 1,399 were single-tenant properties with
the remaining properties being multi-tenant properties.  At December 31, 2003, 1,374 of the 1,399
single-tenant properties, or 98.2%, were net leased with a weighted average
remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of approximately 11.8 years.

Description of Leasing
Structure.

At December 31, 2003,
1,374 or 97.9% of our 1,404 properties were net leased.  In most cases, the leases:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses
(taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on increases in
the consumer price index, fixed increases, or additional rent based upon the
tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. 
Where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the
consumer price index, generally these increases become part of the new
permanent base rent.  Where leases
provide for percentage rent, this additional rent is typically payable only if
the tenants’ gross sales, for a given period (usually one year), exceed a
specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the
amount of gross sales in excess of that level.

Matters Pertaining to Certain Properties
and Tenants.

Of the 26 properties
available for lease or sale at December 31, 2003; all but one are single-tenant
properties.  Seventeen of the properties
had been previously leased to child care operators, five to restaurant operators,
one to a home improvement operator, one to an automotive service operator, one
to a grocery store operator and one to a shoe store operator.  At December 31, 2003, 19 of our properties
under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which
were current with their rent and other obligations.

For 2003, our largest
tenant was Children’s World Learning Centers operates child care facilities and
it accounted for 8.2% of our rental revenue and operates child care
facilities.  However, as a result of
acquisitions during 2003, The Pantry, Inc., an operator of convenience
stores, was our largest tenant at December 31, 2003 based on annualized rental
revenue.  At December 31, 2003, The
Pantry, Inc. accounted for 7.8% of our annualized rental revenue and Children’s
World accounted for 7.3% of our annualized rental revenue.  Annualized rental revenue is calculated by
multiplying the monthly contractual base rent for each of the properties by 12
and adding the previous 12 month’s historic percentage rent, excluding
properties owned by Crest Net.

In general, a downturn
in the industries represented by these tenants, whether nationwide or limited
to specific sectors of the United States, could adversely affect tenants in
these industries, which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our
financial position, results of operations, ability to make distributions to
stockholders and our ability to make debt service payments.  In addition, a substantial number of our
properties are leased to middle-market retail chains that generally have more
limited financial and other resources than certain upper-market retail chains,
and therefore they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in
their respective business or in the regional or national economy in general.

Our tenants in the child
care, convenience store and restaurant industries accounted for approximately
17.8%, 13.3% and 11.8%, respectively, of our rental revenue for the year
2003.  Based on annualized rental revenue
at December 31, 2003, tenants in the child care, convenience store and
restaurant industries accounted for approximately 15.3%, 15.9% and 10.5%,
respectively.  Individually, each of the
other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our
rental revenue or annualized rental revenue.

A downturn in any of
these industries, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the
United States, could adversely affect tenants in these industries, which in
turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of
operations, ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to
make debt service payments.


Certain Properties Under
Development.

Of the 242 properties Realty
Income acquired in 2003 and the 60 properties acquired by Crest Net in 2003,
all but four were occupied at February 16, 2004.  The four properties were leased and under construction, pursuant
to a contract under which the tenant has agreed to develop the properties (with
development costs funded by us or Crest Net), with rent commencing when the
premises open for business.  In the case
of development properties, we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain
where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the improvements and we
fund the costs of that development, or we fund a developer who constructs the
improvements.  In either case, there is
an executed lease at the time of the land purchase and there is a requirement
to complete the construction in a timely basis, generally within eight months
after we purchase the land.  The tenant
or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the
extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined
amount.  We also enter into a lease with
the tenant at the time we purchase the land, which generally requires the
tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens for business.  The base rent is calculated as a percentage
of our acquisition cost for the property, including construction costs and
capitalized interest.  In 2003, Realty
Income acquired eight development properties and Crest Net acquired two
development properties, six of which have been completed, were operating and
generating rent as of February 16, 2004. 
Both Realty Income and Crest Net will continue to pursue development
opportunities under similar arrangements.

OTHER ITEMS

Competition for Acquisition of
Real Estate.

We face competition in
the acquisition, operation and sale of property.  We expect competition from:

•

Businesses;

•

Individuals;

•

Fiduciary
accounts and plans; and

•

Other
entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some of these
competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources.  This competition may result in a higher cost
for properties we wish to purchase.

The tenants leasing our
properties can face significant competition from other operators.  This competition may adversely impact:

•

That
portion, if any, of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s
revenues; and

•

The
tenants’ results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental Liabilities.

Investments in real
property can create a potential for environmental liability.  An owner of property can face liability for
environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous
substances on the property.  We can face
such liability regardless of:

•

Our
knowledge of the contamination;

•

The
timing of the contamination;

•

The
cause of the contamination; or

•

The
party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There
may be environmental problems associated with our properties, of which we are
unaware.  In that regard, a number of
our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell
petroleum-based fuels, as well as oil change and tune-up facilities.  These facilities, or other of our
properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground
tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create
a potential for release of hazardous substances.


The presence of
hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell
that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs.  Although our leases generally require our
tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, ordinances and regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental
liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could
nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership
interest.  There also can be no
assurance that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations
under the leases.  The discovery of environmental
liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial condition or our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.

We have not been
notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any
material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous substances,
toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present
properties.  Nevertheless, if
environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to strict
liability by virtue of our ownership interest.

Since
December 1996, we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our
property portfolio. The limit on our current policy is $10 million per
occurrence and $50 million in the aggregate, subject to a $25,000 self
insurance retention per occurrence for properties with underground storage
tanks and a $100,000 self insurance retention per occurrence for all other
properties.  It is possible that our
insurance will be insufficient to address any particular environmental
situation and that we could be unable to continue to obtain insurance for
environmental matters, at a reasonable cost or at all, in the future.

Taxation of the Company.

Commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we are organized
and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a
“REIT” under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code.  However, we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have
operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a
REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will
allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification
as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly
technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For
example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay
distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In
the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification
as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.

If
we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

•

We would be
required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

We would not
be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed
to our stockholders;

•

We could be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification is lost;

•

We would no
longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

•

This
treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or
distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the
years involved.


Even
if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we are subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.  For example, if we have net income from a
prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  Our subsidiary Crest Net is subject to
federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property.

Effect of Distribution
Requirements.

To
maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are
required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by
excluding net capital gains each year. 
We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that
we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including net capital
gains) each year.

In
addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we
fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our
ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for
the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in
prior years.

We
intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the
distribution requirements of the Code and to reduce exposure to federal income
taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. 
Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses
to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt
amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis
to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax
benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.

Dilution of Common Stock.

Our
future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to raise additional
capital.  If we were to raise additional
capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the
interests of holders of our common stock. Likewise, our Board of Directors is
authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with
dividend, voting and other rights as determined by the Board of
Directors).  Accordingly, the Board of
Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend
and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the
interests of holders of our common stock.

Real Estate Ownership Risks.

We
are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real
estate.  In particular, we face the risk
that rental revenue from the properties may be insufficient to cover all
corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur
and distributions on our stock. 
Additional real estate ownership risks include:

•

Adverse
changes in general or local economic conditions;

•

Changes in
supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

•

Changes in
interest rates and operating expenses;

•

Competition
for tenants;

•

Changes in
market rental rates;

•

Inability to
lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

•

Renewal of
leases at lower rental rates;

•

Inability to
collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;

•

Changes in
tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact
upon the value of real estate;

•

Uninsured
property liability;

•

Property
damage or casualty losses;

•

Unexpected
expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance
with applicable federal, state and local laws;

•

Acts of
terrorism and war; and

•

Acts of God
and other factors beyond the control of our management.


Dependence on Key Personnel.

We
depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees.  The loss of the services of our executive
officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our
operations.

Item 2:

Properties

Information pertaining
to our properties can be found under Item 1.

Item 3:

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to
certain claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of
which cannot be determined at this time. 
In the opinion of management, any liability we might incur upon the
resolution of these claims and lawsuits will not, in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole.

Item 4:

Submission of Matters to a Vote
of Security Holders

No matters were
submitted to stockholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.

GENERAL

Realty Income
Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company ®, is a Maryland corporation
organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, commonly
referred to as a REIT.  Our primary
business objective is to generate dependable monthly distributions from a
consistent and predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO per
share.  Over the past 35 years, Realty
Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail
properties that generate rental revenue under long-term (primarily 15 to 20
year) lease agreements.  The monthly
distributions are supported by the cash flow from 1,404 retail properties
leased to regional and national retail chains.

We also seek to increase
distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio
management and the acquisition of additional properties.  At December 31, 2003, we owned a diversified
portfolio:

•

Of
1,404 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.1%, or 1,378, properties occupied of the 1,404
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 85 different retail chains doing business in 28 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 11.3 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 8,100 square feet.

Of the 1,404 properties
in the portfolio, 1,399, or 99.6%, are single-tenant retail properties and the
remaining five are multi-tenant properties. 
As of December 31, 2003, 1,374, or 98.2%, of the 1,399 single-tenant
properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding
extension options) of approximately 11.8 years.

In addition to our real
estate portfolio, at December 31, 2003, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crest Net
Lease, Inc. had invested $53.3 million in a portfolio of 37 retail properties
located in 13 states.  These properties
are held for sale.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Reserves.

Realty Income is
organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and
distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a
substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail
properties.  We intend to retain an
appropriate amount of cash as working capital. 
At December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $4.8
million.

We believe that our cash
and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities and
borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the
foreseeable future. We intend, however, to use additional sources of capital to
fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit facility.

$250
Million Bank Credit Facility.

We have a $250 million
revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2005.  Realty Income’s current investment grade
credit ratings provide for financing under the $250 million credit
facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR,
plus 90 basis points with a facility fee of 20 basis points, for all-in drawn
pricing of 110 basis points over LIBOR. 
At February 16, 2004, we had a


borrowing capacity of
$237.0 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance
of $13.0 million at an effective interest rate of 2.0%.

The credit facility is
expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other
corporate purposes.  Any additional
borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.

We have no mortgage debt
on any of our properties.

Universal Shelf Registration of
$500 million

.

In December 2002, we
filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the
issuance of up to $500 million in aggregate value of common stock, preferred
stock and debt securities.  This
registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in January 2003.  At February 16, 2004, $133.3 million
remained available for issuance under our universal shelf registration
statement.

Issuances of Common Stock in

.

In October 2003, we
issued 2,875,000 shares of common stock at a price of $40.59 per share.  The net proceeds of $110.8 million were
used to repay borrowings under our $250 million acquisition credit facility.

Conservative Capital Structure

.

We believe that our
stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure.  Therefore, we seek to maintain a
conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed
charge coverage ratios. At February 13, 2004, our total outstanding credit
facility borrowings and outstanding notes were $493.0 million or
approximately 22.2% of our total market capitalization of $2.22 billion.  We define our total market capitalization at
February 13, 2004 as the sum of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 38,006,034 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $42.85 per share, or $1.63 billion;

•

Liquidation
value of the Class B preferred stock of $68.6 million;

•

Liquidation
value of the Class C preferred stock of $34.5 million;

•

Outstanding
borrowings of $13.0 million on our credit facility; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $480.0 million.

Historically, we have
met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock, preferred
stock and long-term unsecured notes. 
Over the long term, we believe that the majority of our future
securities issuances should be in the form of common stock, however, we may
issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time.  We may issue common stock when we believe
that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering
to be accretively invested into additional properties.  In addition, we may issue common stock to
permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or
debt securities.  However, we cannot
assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at terms that are
acceptable to us.

Credit Agency Ratings

.

We are currently
assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior unsecured
notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and Standard &
Poor’s Rating Group.  Currently, Fitch
Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and
Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes.  All of these ratings have been assigned a
“stable” outlook.

We also have received
credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock.  Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB-,
Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard &
Poor’s Rating Group has assigned a rating of BBB-.  All of these ratings have been assigned a “stable” outlook.


During 2003, our credit
ratings were upgraded by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s for our
unsecured notes and our preferred stock.

The credit ratings
assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of
operations and financial condition.

Notes
Outstanding

.

In November 2003, we
issued $150 million of 5-1/2%, 12-year, senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the
“2015 Notes”).  The 2015 Notes were sold
at 99.508% of par.  The proceeds from
this offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition
credit facility.  Interest on the 2015
Notes is paid semiannually.

In March 2003, we issued
$100 million of 5-3/8%, 10-year, senior unsecured notes due 2013 (the “2013
Notes”).  The 2013 Notes were sold at
99.509% of par.  The proceeds from this
offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition credit
facility.  Interest on the 2013 Notes is
paid semiannually.

In January 1999, we
issued $20 million of 8% senior notes due 2009 (the “2009

Notes”). 
Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semiannually.

In
October 1998, we issued $100 million of 8-1/4% Monthly Income Senior Notes due
2008 (the “2008 Notes”).  Interest on
the 2008 Notes is payable monthly.

In
May 1997, we issued $110 million of 7-3/4% senior notes due 2007 (the “2007
Notes”).  Interest on the 2007 Notes is
payable semiannually.

All
of these notes contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on
incurrence of any debt which would cause the our debt to total assets ratio to
exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would
cause our secured debt to total assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation
on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to
be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total
unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt.  We have been in compliance with these
covenants since each of the notes were issued. 
As of February 16, 2004, our credit facility balance was $13.0 million
and our notes outstanding totaled $480 million.

The
following table summaries the maturity of each of our debt obligations as of
December 31, 2003.

development at December 31, 2003.


Preferred
Stock Outstanding.

In May 1999, we issued
2,760,000 shares of 9-3/8% Class B cumulative redeemable preferred stock (the
“Class B Preferred”), of which 2,745,700 shares were outstanding during
2003 and 2002.  Beginning May 25, 2004,
the Class B Preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per
share.  Dividends on the Class B
Preferred are paid quarterly in arrears.

In July 1999, we issued
1,380,000 shares of 9-1/2% Class C cumulative redeemable preferred stock (the “Class C
Preferred”), all of which were outstanding during 2003 and 2002.  Beginning July 30, 2004, the Class C
Preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share.  Dividends on the Class C Preferred are
paid monthly in arrears.

No Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investment.

Realty Income and its
subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in
“variable interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage
in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other
derivative instruments.

As we have no joint
ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock, our financial position or results of operations are currently not
effected by Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of
both Liabilities and Equity.

Acquisitions During 2003.

Realty Income and Crest Net.

Realty Income and Crest
Net invested $371.6 million in aggregate in 302 new properties and properties
under development in 2003.  These 302
properties are located in 25 states and are 100% leased with an initial average
lease length of 19.9 years.

Realty Income.

Realty Income invested
$284.0 million in 242 new properties and properties under development with an
initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.8% in 2003.  These 242 properties are located in 20
states and are 100% leased with an initial average lease length of 19.9 years
and will contain approximately 1.5 million leasable square feet.

Included in the
investments of real estate by Realty Income in 2003 is $13.1 million
invested in properties acquired before 2003 that were under development.  Estimated unfunded development costs on
Realty Income and Crest Net properties under development at December 31,
2003 totaled $8.3 million.  At Dec

ember

31,
2003, eight new properties acquired during 2003 were leased and under
development, pursuant to contracts under which the tenants agreed to develop
the properties (with development costs funded by Realty Income or Crest Net),
with rent scheduled to begin at various times during the first nine months of
2004.

The initial weighted
average contractual lease rate on our investments is computed as estimated
contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of

properties

under development, the estimated base rent under the lease) for the first year
of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment
of contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds
invested will remain at the percentages listed above.

The 242 new properties
acquired by Realty Income are net-leased to 15 different retail chains in ten
industries: automotive collision service, automotive service, automotive tire
service, convenience store, equipment rental service, grocery store, home
improvement, restaurant, sporting goods and travel plaza.  During 2003, we added two new industries
(equipment rental service and travel plaza) to our portfolio.  We also segregated the


automotive tire service
industry from the automotive parts industry. 
This segregation was made to reflect the different economic
characteristics of the two industries.

Crest Net.

Crest Net invested $87.6
million during 2003 in 60 new retail properties and properties under
development.

Investments in Existing
Properties.

In 2003, we capitalized
costs of $656,000 on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of
$392,000 for re-leasing costs and $264,000 for building improvements

Sales of Investment Properties.

During 2003, we sold 35
properties and exchanged excess land parcels from three properties for an
aggregate of $23.1 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.5 million. The
35 properties sold consisted of 19 child care facilities, nine restaurants,
three home improvement stores, two auto services location, one consumer
electronics store and one other property. 
The land exchanges were on three convenience store locations.  These gains are included in discontinued
operations.  The net proceeds from the
sale of these properties were or will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness
on our credit facility and to invest in new properties.

Crest Net Property Sales.

During 2003, Crest Net
our wholly-owned subsidiary sold 27 properties from its inventory for $45.2
million, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million.

Crest Net’s Property Inventory.

Crest
Net’s property inventory at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 totaled
$53.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and is included in real
estate held for sale, net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The financial statements
of Crest Net are consolidated into Realty Income’s financial statements.  All material intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Increase in Monthly
Distributions to Common Stockholders.

We continue our 34-year
policy of paying distributions monthly. 
Monthly distributions per share were increased by $0.00125 in April 2003
to $0.19625, in July 2003 to $0.1975; in October 2003 to $0.19875 and in
January 2004 to $0.20.  The increase in
January 2004 was our 25

th

consecutive quarterly increase and 27

th

increase since our listing in 1994 on the New York Stock Exchange.  In December 2003, January 2004 and February
2004, we declared distributions of $0.20 per share, which were paid on
January 15, 2004, February 17, 2004 and payable on March 15, 2004,
respectively.

The monthly distribution
of $0.20 per common share represents a current annualized distribution of $2.40
per share and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 5.9%, based on
a closing price on February 13, 2004 of $42.85.  Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly
distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current level of
distributions, that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions
per share, or what the actual distribution yield will be for any future period.

Credit Ratings Upgrades.

In November 2003, our
credit ratings were upgraded by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group.  Our senior unsecured debt rating was raised
to BBB from BBB- and our preferred stock rating was raised to BBB- from BB+,
with a stable outlook.

In February 2003, our
credit ratings were upgraded by Moody’s Investors Service.  Our senior unsecured debt rating was raised
to Baa2 from Baa3 and our preferred stock rating was raised to Baa3 from Ba1,
with a stable


outlook.

Stock and Senior Debt Purchase
Program.

In January 2000, our
Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $10 million of our
outstanding common and preferred shares and senior debt securities.  From time to time since January 2000, we
concluded that our share price justified purchasing shares since this provided
an attractive return on our investment capital.  We have purchased an aggregate of $6.7 million of our securities
in 2000 and 2001.  We did not purchase
any of our securities in 2002 or 2003, but may do so from time to time in the
future.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies.

Our consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Our consolidated financial statements are
the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations.  Completing our consolidated
financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported values and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements.  We believe that we have
made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a way that
accurately reflects our financial condition. 
We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using
our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors to ensure
that they are reasonable for reporting purposes.  However, actual results may differ from these estimates and
assumptions.

In order to prepare our
consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set
forth by generally accepted accounting principles, many subjective judgments
must be made with regard to critical accounting polices.  One of these judgments is our estimate for
useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties.  Depreciation of buildings and improvements
is computed using the straight—line method over an estimated useful life of 25
years.  If we use a shorter or longer
estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of
operations.  We believe that 25 years is
an appropriate estimate of useful life. 
No depreciation has been recorded on Crest Net’s properties because they
are held for sale.

Another significant
judgment that must be made is the impairment losses taken on our properties
when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. 
Generally, a provision is made for impairment loss if estimated future
operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated
disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value.  Impairment losses are measured as the amount
by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset.  If a property is held for sale,
it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less cost
to sell.  The carrying value of our real
estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet.  If events should occur that required us to
reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for
impairment losses, it could have a material impact on our results of
operations.


The following is a comparison of our
results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Rental Revenue.

Rental revenue was
$149.3 million for 2003 versus $133.9 million for 2002, an increase of $15.4
million, or 11.5%.  Rental revenue was
$115.9 million in 2001.  The increase in
rental revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 is attributable to:

•

The
242 retail properties acquired in 2003 by Realty Income, which generated
revenue of $7.6 million;

•

The
108 retail properties acquired in 2002 by Realty Income, which generated
revenue of $13.5 million in 2003 compared to $6.4 million in 2002, an
increase of $7.1 million;

•

Same
store rents generated on 1,003 leased properties owned in all of both 2003 and
2002 increased by $1.1 million, or 0.9%, to $122.2 million from $121.1
million.

•

Properties
owned by Crest Net, which generated revenue of $1.7 million in 2003 compared to
$1.4 million in 2002, an increase of $0.3 million;

•

Development
properties acquired before 2002 that started paying rent in 2002, properties
that were vacant during part of 2003 or 2002 and lease termination settlements
generated revenue of $4.5 million in 2003 as compared to $4.6 million in
2002, a decrease of $0.1 million; and

•

A
decrease in straight-line rent of $421,000 in 2003 as compared to 2002.

We anticipate that our
rental revenue from the 242 properties acquired in 2003 will increase
significantly in 2004 since the majority of these properties were acquired in
the fourth quarter.

Of the 1,404 properties
in the portfolio at December 31, 2003, 1,399, or 99.6%, are single-tenant
properties and the remaining properties are multi-tenant properties.  Of the 1,399 single-tenant properties,
1,374, or 98.2%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term
(excluding extension options) of approximately 11.8 years at December 31,
2003.  Of our 1,374 leased single-tenant
properties, 1,301, or 94.7%, were under leases that provide for increases in
rents through:

•

Base rent
increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings;

•

Overage rent
based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales;

•

Fixed
increases; or

•

A
combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage
rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $1.2 million in 2003, $1.5
million in 2002 and $1.6 million in 2001. 
Percentage rent in 2003 was less than 1% of rental revenue and we
anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1% of rental revenue in 2004.

Our
portfolio of retail real estate leased primarily under net leases to regional
and national chains continues to perform well and provides dependable lease
revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders. At
December 31, 2003, our portfolio of 1,404 retail properties was 98.1% leased
with 26 properties available for lease. 
Transactions to lease or sell 12 of the 26 properties available for
lease or sale at December 31, 2003 were underway or completed as of
February 10, 2004.  We anticipate these
transactions to be completed during the next six months, although we cannot
guarantee that all of these properties can be sold or leased within this
period.  It has been our experience that
approximately 1% to 3% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given
time, however, we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for
lease will not exceed these levels.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Acquired for
Resale by Crest Net.

In 2003, Crest Net sold
27 properties for $45.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million.  In 2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties for
$27.3 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.5 million.  In 2001, Crest Net sold nine properties for
$28.9 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.4 million.  All gains on sales of real estate acquired
for resale are reported before income taxes.


At
December 31, 2003, Crest Net had invested $53.3 million in 37 properties, which
are held for sale.  Our goal is for
Crest Net to carry an average inventory of $20 to $25 million in real
estate.  Crest Net’s level of inventory
increased substantially during the second half of 2003.  Crest Net generates an earnings spread on
the difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in
inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties.  It is our belief that at this level of
inventory, earnings will more than cover the ongoing expenses of Crest Net.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense was
$3.4 million higher in 2003 than in 2002 primarily due to higher average
outstanding balances.  The following is
a summary of the five components of our interest expense (dollars in
thousands):

Interest on outstanding
credit facilities and notes increased by $3.7 million in 2003 as compared to
2002 primarily due to higher average outstanding balances.  In 2002, unamortized fees of $406,000
relating to our previous credit facilities, which were canceled in October
2002, were charged to interest expense.

At February 16, 2004,
the weighted average interest rate on our:

•

Credit
facility borrowings of $13.0 million was 2.0%;

•

Notes
payable of $480 million was 6.7%; and

•

Combined
outstanding credit facility and notes of $493.0 million was 6.5%.

Interest Coverage Ratio.

Our interest coverage
ratio for 2003 was 5.3 times, for 2002 it was 5.5 times and for 2001 it was 4.4
times.  Interest coverage ratio is
calculated as: the interest coverage amount (as calculated below) divided by interest
expense.  We consider interest coverage
ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet
its interest expense.  Our calculation
of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other
companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  This information should not be considered as
an alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures.


The following is a
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to our interest coverage
amount (dollars in thousands):

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.

Our fixed charge
coverage ratio for 2003 and 2002 was 3.9 times and for 2001 was 3.2 times.
 Fixed charge coverage ratio is
calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio, except that
preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator.  We consider fixed charge coverage ratio to
be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its
interest and preferred stock dividend payments.  Our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be
different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability
may be limited.  This information should
not be considered as an alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures.

Interest coverage amount
divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends (dollars in
thousands):

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and
amortization was $33.5 million in 2003 versus $30.1 million in 2002 and $27.7
million in 2001.  The increase in
depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties in 2003,
2002 and 2001, which was partially offset by property sales in these
years.  Included in 2001, is $924,000 of
amortization expense related to goodwill.

General and Administrative
Expenses.

General and
administrative expenses increased by $1.7 million to $11.2 million in 2003
versus $9.5 million in 2002. General and administrative expenses in 2001 were $7.8
million.  In 2003, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 7.2% as
compared to 6.9% in 2002 and 6.5% in 2001. 
Included in general and administrative expenses are $566,000, $410,000
and $496,000 of expenses attributable to Crest Net in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  General and
administrative expenses, excluding expenses attributable to Crest Net,
increased primarily due to increases in corporate insurance, payroll and
staffing costs.


As our property
portfolio has grown and continues to grow, we have and anticipate that we will
continue to increase the level of our staffing.  We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to
increase due to costs attributable to payroll, staffing costs and corporate
governance.  We anticipate that our
rental revenue will increase at a faster rate in 2004 than our general and
administrative expenses.

We had 58 employees at
February 16, 2004 compared to 56 at March 1, 2003, 53 at March 1, 2002 and 49
at March 1, 2001.

Property Expenses.

Property expenses are
broken down into costs associated with non-net leased multi-tenant properties,
unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio expenses.  Expenses related to the multi-tenant and
unleased single-tenant properties include, but are not limited to, property
taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt
expense and legal fees.  General portfolio
costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections
and title search fees.  At December 31,
2003, 26 properties were available for lease, as compared to 27 at December 31,
2002 and 20 at December 31, 2001.

Property expenses were
$2.6 million in 2003, $2.5 million in 2002 and $2.3 million in 2001.  The $100,000 increase in property expenses
in 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with
vacant properties.

Income Taxes.

Income taxes

increased $1.0 million to $2.7 million in 2003 as compared to $1.7 million in
2002.  The increase in 2003 is due to an
increase in Crest Net income taxes. 
Crest Net taxes were higher in 2003 as compared to 2002 because Crest
Net’s taxable net income was higher.

The following is a
summary of our income taxes (dollars in thousands):

Gain on Sales of Investment Properties
by Realty Income.

In 2003, we sold or
exchanged 35 properties for a total of $23.1 million and recognized a gain
of $6.5 million.  This gain is included
in discontinued operations.  In 2002, we
sold or exchanged 35 properties for a total of $20.2 million and recognized a
gain of $6.3 million.  Of this gain,
$6.0 million is included in discontinued operations.  In 2001, we sold or exchanged 35 properties for a total of $39.5
million and recognized a gain of $10.5 million.

We have an active
portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we
believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average
remaining lease term.  At December 31,
2003, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $60.1 million as held
for sale, which includes $53.3 million in properties owned by Crest Net.  Additionally, we anticipate selling
investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically
identified.  We anticipate we will
receive between $15 million and $35 million in proceeds from the sale of
investment properties during the next 12 months and we intend to invest these
proceeds into new property acquisitions. 
However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the
next 12 months.


Discontinued
Operations

.

The
operations of seven properties listed as held for sale at December 31, 2003,
plus properties sold in 2002 and 2003 have been classified as discontinued
operations.

The following is a summary of our
discontinued operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 (dollars in thousands):

Provisions for Impairment.

Provisions

for impairment of $570,000 were taken in 2003 as compared to $1.3 million
in 2002.  These impairment losses are
included in discontinued operations. 
Provisions for impairment of $1.5 million were taken in 2001, of which
$70,000 is included in discontinued operations.

Preferred stock dividends

.

We paid preferred stock
dividends of $9.7 million in each of 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Net income available to common
stockholders.

Net income available to
common stockholders in 2003 increased by $7.7 million, or 11.2%, to $76.7
million as compared to $69.0 million in 2002. 
Net income available to common stockholders in 2001 was $57.8 million.

Net income
available to common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of
investment properties.  The amount of
gains and losses varies from period to period, based on the timing of property
sales, and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain
recognized from the sales of investment properties during 2003 was
$6.5 million as compared to $6.3 million during 2002 and $10.5 million in
2001.


FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO)

AVAILABLE
TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

FFO for 2003 increased
by $10.3 million, or 11.0%, to $104.0 million as compared to $93.7 million in
2002.  The following is a reconciliation
of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most
comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measure) to FFO,
information regarding distributions paid and the diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding for 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):

We define FFO, a
non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trust’s definition, as net income available to common stockholders,
plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real
estate industry, reduced by gains and increased by losses on (i) sales of
investment property and (ii) extraordinary items.

We consider FFO to
be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating performance as it
is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that
excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. 
The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets
requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which
implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over
time.  Since real estate values
historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating
results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less
informative.  The use of FFO is
recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure.  In addition, FFO is used as a measure of our
compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.

Presentation of
this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating
performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs
calculate FFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be
meaningful.  Furthermore, FFO is not
necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not
be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of Realty
Income’s performance.  In addition, FFO
should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from
operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity, of our
ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments.


Other Non-Cash Items and
Capitalized Expenditures.

The following
information includes non-cash items and capitalized expenditures on existing
properties in our portfolio.  These
items are not utilized in the adjustments to net income available to common
stockholders to arrive at funds from operations.  Analysts and investors often request this supplemental
information.

(1) Amortization of
deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and
capitalized when our notes were issued in May 1997, October 1998, January 1999,
March 2003 and November 2003.  These costs
are being amortized over the lives of these notes.  No costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual
fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included.

(2) Negative amounts
represent that our straight-line rent was more than our actual cash rent
collected by the amounts indicated. 
Positive amounts represent that our straight-line rent was less than our
actual cash rent collected by the amounts indicated.

FFO GENERATED BY CREST NET

Crest Net generated $4.6
million in FFO for Realty Income in 2003, $2.7 million in 2002 and
$2.4 million in 2001.  As a result
of the increase in Crest Net’s inventory, we anticipate that Crest Net’s
contributions to our FFO in the early quarters of 2004 may be more significant
compared to the same quarters in 2003. 
The future contribution, if any, to our FFO by Crest Net will depend on
the timing and the number of property acquisitions and sales it achieves, if
any, in a given period.  The following
is a calculation of Crest Net’s FFO contribution to Realty Income for 2003 and
2002 (dollars in thousands):

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Tenant leases generally
provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’
sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index, and/or fixed
increases.  We expect that inflation
will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time.  During times when inflation is greater than
increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep
up with the rate of inflation.

Approximately 97.9%, or
1,374, of the 1,404 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net
leases


where the tenant is
responsible for property costs and expenses. 
Net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due
to inflation.  Inflation and increased costs
may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating
expenses exceed increases in revenue.

IMPACT
OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In January 2003, the
FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Certain Variable
Interest Entities

. 
FIN No.  46R requires consolidation of a variable interest
entity by an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest.  The impact of adopting FIN No. 46R is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to
interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and
long-term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate
investment portfolio and operations. 
Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of
interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall
borrowing costs.  To achieve these
objectives we issue long-term notes, primarily at fixed rates, and may
selectively enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate
lock agreements, interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest
rate risk on a related financial instrument. 
We were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at December
31, 2003.  We do not enter into any
transactions for speculative or trading purposes.

Our interest rate risk
is monitored using a variety of techniques. 
The following table presents the principal amounts, weighted average
interest rates, fair values and other terms required by year of expected
maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate
changes (dollars in table in millions):

(1) The credit facility
expires in October 2005.  The credit
facility balance as of February 16, 2004 was $13.0 million.

(2) $110 million matures
in May 2007.

(3) $100 million matures
in October 2008.

(4) $20 million matures
in January 2009, $100 million matures in March 2013 and $150 million matures in
November 2015.

(5) We base the fair
value of the fixed rate debt at December 31, 2003 on the closing market price
or indicative price per each note.  The
fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because
its terms are similar to those available in the market place.

The table incorporates
only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2003; it does not consider
those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.  As a result, our ultimate realized gain or
loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures
that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest
rates.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders

Realty Income
Corporation:

We have audited the
consolidated financial statements of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries
as listed in the accompanying table of contents.  In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement Schedule III as listed
in the accompanying table of contents. 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America.  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Realty Income Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the related financial statement Schedule
III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein.

1.

Organization and Operation

Realty
Income Corporation (“Realty Income,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is organized
as a Maryland corporation.  We invest in
commercial retail real estate and have elected to be taxed as a real estate
investment trust (“REIT”).  At December
31, 2003, we owned 1,404 properties in 48 states containing over
11.3 million leasable square feet, plus an additional 37 properties owned
by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest Net”).

Crest Net was created to buy, own and sell
properties, primarily to individual investors, many of whom are involved in
tax-deferred exchanges, under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (“the Code”).

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures

Federal
Income Taxes

.  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under
the Code.  We believe we have qualified
and continue to qualify as a REIT.  As a
REIT, we will be permitted to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders and
generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on such
income.  Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, except for federal income taxes of Crest Net, which totaled $1.8
million, $1.0 million and $1.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
and which are included in income taxes.

Earnings
and profits

which determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders, differ from
net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in the
estimated useful lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the
carrying value (basis) on the investments in properties for tax purposes, among
other things.

The
following reconciles our net income available to common stockholders to taxable
income for the year ended December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands) (unaudited):


Net
Income Per Common Share

.  Basic net income per common share is
computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted net income per common share is
computed by dividing the amount of net income available to common stockholders
for the period by the number of common shares that would have been outstanding
assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common
shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The
following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per
common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per
common share computation, for the years ended December 31:

In
2003, 2002 and 2001, no stock options were anti-dilutive.

Discontinued Operations

.  In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,
the operations of seven properties listed as held for sale at December 31,
2003, plus properties sold during 2003 and 2002 were reported as discontinued
operations, and their respective 2002 and 2001 results of operations were
reclassified to discontinued operations.

The following is a summary of our
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
(dollars in thousands):

Leases

. 
All leases are accounted for as operating leases.  Under this method, lease payments that have
fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.  Any rental revenue
contingent upon a tenant’s sales is recognized only after the tenants exceed
their sales breakpoint.  Rental increases
based upon changes in the consumer price indexes are recognized only after the
changes in the indexes have occurred, and then applied according to the lease
agreements.

Principles
of Consolidation

.  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest Net and other entities
for which we make operational and financial decisions (control), after
elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions.


Cash
Equivalents

.  We consider all short-term, highly liquid
investments to be cash equivalents, which are readily convertible to cash and
have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Gain
on Sales of Properties

.  We recognize gains or losses on sales of
properties in accordance with Statement No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.

Depreciation
and Amortization

.  Depreciation of buildings and improvements
are computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25
years.  Amortization of goodwill in 2001
and prior periods was computed using the straight-line method over 25 years.

Maintenance
and Repairs

.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred.  Replacements and
betterments are capitalized.

Provisions
for Impairment

.  We review long-lived assets, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. 
Generally, a provision is made for impairment if estimated future
operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated
disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value.  Impairment loss is measured as the amount by
which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  If a property is held for sale, it is
carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost to sell.  Provisions for impairment of $570,000, $1.3
million and $1.5 million were recorded in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
are included in discontinued operations, except for $1.4 million of the 2001
provision.

Stock
Option Plan

.  Prior to 2002 we accounted for our stock
option plan in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issues to Employees

and related interpretations. No stock
option-based compensation cost was reflected in 2001 net income, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

, and beginning in 2002 started
expensing the costs for all stock option awards granted, modified, or settled
after January 1, 2002. Stock option awards under the plan vest over periods
ranging from one to five years. 
Therefore, the cost related to stock option-based compensation included
in the determination of net income available to common stockholders is less
than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had
been applied to all stock option awards since the original effective date of
Statement No. 123.

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income available to common
stockholders and earnings per share if the fair based method had been applied
to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period (dollars in thousands,
except per share amounts).


Goodwill

. 
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.

This statement changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization
method to an impairment-only approach. Under Statement No. 142, goodwill
will be tested for impairment annually as well as when events or circumstances
occur that indicate that our goodwill might be impaired. We adopted the
provisions of Statement No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and ceased amortizing
our goodwill, which totaled $17.2 million. During the second quarter of 2002,
we completed the transitional impairment testing of our goodwill and found that
our goodwill was not impaired. We did not have any new goodwill or record an
impairment on our existing goodwill during 2003 or 2002.  Amortization of goodwill for 2001 was
$924,000.  We do not have any intangible
assets as contemplated under Statement No. 142 or unamortized negative
goodwill.

The following table reconciles reported net
income available to common stockholders to adjusted net income available to
common stockholders.  It excludes the
effect of goodwill amortization expense that is no longer amortized under
Statement No. 142 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Use
of Estimates

.  The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

. 
Certain of the 2002 and 2001 balances have been reclassified to conform
to the 2003 presentation.

3.

Retail Properties Acquired

We acquire land, buildings and improvements
that is used by retail operators. 
Generally, we do not acquire properties with in-place operating leases,
nor other forms of intangible assets.

A. 
During 2003, Realty Income and Crest Net invested $371.6 million in
aggregate in 302 new retail properties and properties under development.  These 302 properties are located in 25
states, will contain approximately 1.9 million leasable square feet and
are 100% leased, with an average initial lease term of 19.9 years.

During 2002, Realty Income and Crest Net
invested $139.4 million in aggregate in 111 new retail properties and
properties under development.  These 111
properties are located in 24 states, contain approximately 733,000 leasable
square feet and are 100% leased, with an average initial lease term of 19.8
years.

B. 
During 2003, Realty Income invested $284.0 million in 242 new retail
properties and properties under development, with an initial weighted average
contractual lease rate of 9.8%.  These
242 properties are located


in 20 states, will contain approximately 1.5
million leasable square feet and are 100% leased, with an average initial lease
term of 19.9 years.

During 2002, Realty Income invested $133.3
million in 108 new retail properties and properties under development, with an
initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 10.4%.  These 108 properties are located in 24
states, contain approximately 719,800 leasable square feet and are 100% leased,
with an average initial lease term of 19.8 years.

C. 
During 2003, Crest Net invested $87.6 million in 60 new retail
properties and properties under development.

During 2002, Crest Net invested
$6.1 million in three new retail properties and properties under
development.

D. 
Crest Net’s property inventory at December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002 totaled $53.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and is
included in real estate held for sale, net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

4.

Credit Facilities

In
October 2002, we entered into a $250 million credit facility to replace the
existing $200 million acquisition credit facility and $25 million credit
facility, each of which was scheduled to expire in 2003.  Unamortized fees of $406,000 relating to the
canceled credit facilities were charged to interest expense in 2002.

The borrowing rate on the $250 million credit
facility was reduced compared to the previous credit facilities. As of December
31, 2003, Realty Income’s investment grade credit ratings provide for borrowing
at LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 90 basis points, with a facility
fee of 20 basis points on the total of the facility amount, for all-in drawn
pricing of 110 basis points over LIBOR as compared to an all-in pricing of 145
basis points on our previous credit facilities.  The term of our current facility extends through October 2005.

The
average borrowing rate on our credit facilities during 2003 was 2.2%, compared
to 3.0% in 2002 and 6.4% in 2001.  Our current
credit facility is, and previous credit facilities were, subject to various
leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations.  The Company is and has been in compliance with these covenants.

In
2003, 2002 and 2001, interest of $697,000, $511,000 and $385,000, respectively,
was capitalized with respect to properties under development.

5.

Notes Payable

In
November 2003, we issued $150 million of 5-1/2% senior unsecured notes due 2015
(the “2015 Notes”).  The notes were sold
at 99.508% of par.  The net proceeds
from this offering were used to acquire new retail properties and to repay
borrowings under our unsecured acquisition credit facility.  Interest on the 2015 Notes is paid
semiannually.

In
March 2003, we issued $100 million of 5-3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2013
(the “2013 Notes”).  The notes were sold
at 99.509% of par.  The net proceeds
from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition
credit facility.  Interest on the 2013
Notes is paid semiannually.

In
January 1999, we issued $20 million of 8% senior unsecured notes due 2009 (the
“2009 Notes”).  Interest on the 2009
Notes is payable semiannually.

In
October 1998, we issued $100 million of 8-1/4% Monthly Income Senior Notes due
2008 (the “2008 Notes”).  In May 1998,
we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement associated with the
2008 Notes.


In
settlement of the agreement, we made a payment of $8.7 million in 1998.  The payment on the agreement is being
amortized over 10 years (the life of the 2008 Notes) as a yield adjustment to
interest expense.  After taking into
effect the results of a treasury interest rate lock agreement, the effective
rate to us on the 2008 Notes is 9.12%. 
Interest on the 2008 Notes is payable monthly. The 2008 Notes are
unsecured.

In
May 1997, we issued $110 million of 7-3/4% senior unsecured notes due 2007 (the
“2007 Notes”).  In December 1996, we
entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement associated with the 2007
Notes.  In settlement of the agreement,
we received $1.1 million in 1997. 
The payment received on the agreement is being amortized over 10 years
(the life of the 2007 Notes) as a yield adjustment to interest expense.  After taking into effect the results of a
treasury interest rate lock agreement, the effective interest rate to us on the
2007 Notes is 7.62%.  Interest on the
2007 Notes is payable semiannually.

Interest
incurred on the 2015 Notes, 2013 Notes, 2009 Notes, 2008 Notes and 2007 Notes
collectively for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$23.6 million, $18.4 million and $18.4 million, respectfully.

6.

Common Stock Offerings

A.

In October 2003, we issued 2,875,000

Operating Leases

A.

At December 31, 2003, we owned 1,404
properties in 48 states, excluding 37 properties owned by Crest Net.  Of these 1,404 properties, 1,399 are
single-tenant and the remainder are multi-tenant.  At December 31, 2003, 26 properties were vacant and
available for lease or sale.

Substantially
all leases are net leases where the tenant pays property taxes and assessments,
maintains the interior and exterior of the building and leased premises, and
carries insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire and
extended coverage.

Percentage
rent for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1.2 million, $1.6 million and $1.7 million,
respectively, including amounts recorded to discontinued operations.

At
December 31, 2003, minimum annual rents to be received on the operating leases
are as follows (dollars in thousands):

Major Tenants – The following schedule
presents rental revenue, including percentage rents, from tenants representing
more than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest Net

In 2003, Crest Net sold 27 properties for
$45.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million, before income
taxes.

In
2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties for $27.3 million, which resulted in a gain
of $3.5 million, before income taxes.


In
2001, Crest Net sold nine properties for $28.9 million, which resulted in a
gain of $3.4 million, before income taxes.

10.

Gain on Sales of Investment Properties by Realty Income

During
2003, we sold or exchanged 35 investment properties and exchanged three excess
land parcels (from three properties) for $23.1 million, which resulted in a
gain of $6.5 million.  This gain on
sales of investment properties is included in discontinued operations.  Included in the 35 properties was one
property leased by one of our tenants that we exchanged for another property
owned by that tenant (see note 13B).

In
2002, we sold or exchanged 35 properties for $20.2 million and recognized a
gain of $6.3 million.  Of this gain,
$6.0 million is included in discontinued operations.  Included in the 35 properties was one property leased by one of
our tenants that we exchanged for another property owned by that tenant (see
note 13B).

In
2001, we sold 35 properties for $39.5 million and recognized a gain of $10.5
million.

11.

Purchases of Realty Income Securities

In
January 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $10
million of our outstanding common stock, preferred stock and senior debt
securities.  We purchased an aggregate
of $6.7 million of our securities in 2000 and 2001. No securities were
purchased in 2003 or 2002.

12.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We
believe that the carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 reasonably approximate the fair values for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and all liabilities, due to their
short-term nature, except for lines of credit payable and notes payable.  In making these assessments, we used
estimates.  The fair value of the lines
of credit payable approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar
to those available in the market place. 
The fair value of the notes payable at December 31, 2003 and 2002 is
estimated to be $498.7 million and $250.6 million, respectively,
based upon the closing market price per note or indicative price per each note
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

13.

Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

Interest
paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $32.5 million, $21.4 million and $25.3 million,
respectively.

Income
taxes paid by Realty Income and Crest Net in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $0.8
million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million, respectively.

The
following non-cash investing and financing activities are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):

A.  Additions to properties resulted in the
following:


B.  In 2003, we exchanged excess land parcels
from three different properties leased by one of our tenants for land (with
improvements) owned by that same tenant. 
In 2003, we also exchanged one property leased by one of our tenants for
another property owned by that tenant. 
In 2002, we exchanged one property leased by one of our tenants for
another property owned by that tenant. 
The gain on exchange is included in discontinued operations. These
transactions resulted in the following:

Employee Benefit Plan

We
have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our employees.  Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect
to make contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation,
subject to limits under the IRS Code. 
We match 50% of our employee’s contributions, up to 3% of the employee’s
compensation.  Our aggregate matching
contributions each year has been immaterial to our results of operations.

15.

Stock Incentive Plan

In 2003, our Board of Directors adopted and
our stockholders approved the 2003 Incentive Award Plan of Realty Income
Corporation to enable us to attract and retain the services of
directors, employees and consultants considered essential to our
long-term success by offering them an opportunity to own stock
in Realty Income and/or rights which will reflect our growth,
development and financial success.  Under the terms of this plan, the
aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject to options, stock
purchase rights, stock appreciation rights and other awards will be
no more than 1,714,000 shares.  The
maximum number of shares which may be subject to options, stock purchase
rights, stock appreciation rights and other awards granted under
the plan to any individual in any calendar year may not exceed 800,000
shares.  This plan has a term of 10 years from the date it was adopted by
our Board of Directors.  In 2003, there were no grants made under this
plan.

In
1993, our Board of Directors approved a stock incentive plan (the “Stock Plan”)
designed to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company
by enabling those individuals to participate in the ownership of the
Company.  The Stock Plan authorizes the
issuance in each calendar year of up to 3% of the total shares outstanding at the
end of such year.  The Stock Plan
provides for grants of up to 1,950,308 shares. 
The Stock Plan provides for the award (subject to ownership limitations)
of a broad variety of stock-based compensation alternatives such as
nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and
performance awards.


In
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company issued 94,866 shares, 110,572 shares and
61,500 shares of restricted stock, respectively, which vest over periods
ranging from five years to ten years. 
The weighted average fair market values of the restricted stock issued
in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $35.14, $29.89 and $25.43, respectively.

Stock
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock’s fair
market value at the date of grant. 
Stock options expire ten years from the date they are granted and vest
over service periods of one, three, four and five years.

The
following table summarizes our stock option activity for the years 2003, 2002
and 2001:

At
December 31, 2003, the options outstanding under the Stock Plan had exercise
prices ranging from $20.00 to $29.40, with a weighted average price of $25.05,
and expiration dates ranging from August 2004 to December 2011 with a weighted
average remaining term of 5.3 years.  At
December 31, 2003, the options exercisable under the Stock Plan had exercise
prices ranging from $20.00 to $29.40 with a weighted average price of $24.28.

The
fair value of each stock option grant was estimated at the date of grant using
the binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:


16.

Stockholder Rights Plan

In
1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights
Plan”) that will expire in July 2008. 
The Rights Plan assigns one right (a “Right”) to purchase one
one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of our Class A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, for each share of common stock
owned on or issued after July 1, 1998. 
Currently, the Rights are not exercisable and do not trade separately
from our common stock.

Under
specified circumstances, stockholders will be able to exercise their Rights if
a person or group acquires 15% of our common stock or makes a tender offer to
acquire 15% or more of our common stock. 
In these circumstances, stockholders other than the acquirer would be
able to exercise the Rights to purchase our common stock or, in some
situations, the acquirer’s stock at a 50% discount.

17.

Segment Information

We
evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by
industry basis.  For financial reporting
purposes, we have grouped our tenants into 14 reportable industry segments,
including properties owned by Crest Net that are grouped together.  All of the properties are incorporated into
one of the applicable segments.  Because
almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating expenses, revenue
is the only component of segment profit and loss we measure.

The
following tables set forth certain information regarding the properties owned
by us, classified according to the business of the respective tenants as of
December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands):

(1) 
Includes 15 retail industry segments.


(1)  Includes 15 retail industry segments.

18.

Commitments and Contingencies

In
the ordinary course of our business, we are party to various legal actions
which we believe are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our
business.  We believe that the outcome
of the proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our
consolidated statements taken as a whole.

We have committed to pay
estimated unfunded development costs of $8.3 million on properties under
development at December 31, 2003.

Item 9:

Changes In and Disagreements
with Accountants on Accounting and Financial

Disclosure

We have had no
disagreements with our independent auditors on accountancy or financial
disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal
years.

Item
9A:

Controls
and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c)) that are
designed to ensure that

information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Within 90 days prior to
the date of this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Changes in Internal Controls.

There have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation.  There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses,
and therefore no corrective actions were taken.
