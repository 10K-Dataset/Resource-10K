PART I

Item 1:

Business

THE COMPANY

Realty
Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

,
is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate
investment trust, or REIT.  Our primary
business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a
consistent and predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO, per
share.  The monthly distributions are
supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to
regional and national retail chains.  We
have

in-house
acquisition, leasing, legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio
management and capital markets expertise.

Over the past 36 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring
and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under
long-term lease agreements (primarily 15- to 20-years).

In addition, w

e
seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both
active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties. Our
portfolio management focus includes:

•

Contractual
rent increases on existing leases;

•

Rent
increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit;
and

•

The
active management of our property portfolio, including the re-leasing of vacant
properties and selective sales of properties.

Our
acquisition of additional properties adheres to a focused strategy of primarily
acquiring properties that are:

•

Freestanding,
single-tenant, retail locations;

•

Leased
to regional and national retail chains; and

•

Leased
under long-term, net-lease agreements.

At
December 31, 2004, we owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,533 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 97.9%, or 1,501 properties occupied of the 1,533
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 93 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 11.9 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 7,800 square feet.

Of
the 1,533 properties in the portfolio, 1,528, or 99.7%, are single-tenant,
retail properties and the remaining five are multi-tenant properties. At December 31,
2004, 1,497, or 98.0%, of the 1,528 single-tenant properties were leased with a
weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of
approximately 12.0 years.

In addition, our
wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., owned eight
properties with a total investment of $10.1 million at December 31,
2004. These properties are classified as held for sale on our consolidated
balance sheets.  Crest Net was created to
buy, own and sell properties, primarily to individual investors, many of whom
are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

We
typically acquire retail store properties under long-term leases with retail
chain store operators. These transactions generally provide capital to retail
chain owners and operators for expansion or other corporate purposes. Our
acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in well-defined target
markets and generally focus on retailers providing goods and services that
satisfy basic consumer needs.

Our
net-lease agreements generally:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses (taxes,
insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on increases in
the consumer price index, fixed increases, or to a lesser degree, additional
rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.


Realty
Income commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the
merger of 25 public and private real estate limited partnerships with and into
the Company. Each of the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the
purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased properties.

The
six senior officers of Realty Income owned 1.3% of our outstanding common stock
with a market value of $24.7 million at February 15, 2005. The directors
and six senior officers of Realty Income, as a group, owned 2.6% of our
outstanding common stock with a market value of $51.9 million at February 15,
2005.

Realty
Income’s common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under
the ticker symbol “O.” Our central index key number is 726728 and cusip number
is 756109-104.

Realty
Income’s Class D cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE
under the ticker symbol “OprD” and its cusip number is 756109-609.

Realty
Income’s 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes, due 2008 are listed on the NYSE
under the ticker symbol “OUI.”  The cusip
number of these notes is 756109-203.

Realty
Income had 69 employees as of February 15, 2005, six of whom are
part-time, plus one contract consultant..

We
maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make
available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to
those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file
these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  None of the information on our website is
deemed to be part of this report.

RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS

Two-for-one Common Stock Split

On December 31, 2004, after the New York Stock
Exchange closed, we completed a 2-for-1 stock split.  At that time we issued, to our common
stockholders, one share of common stock for each common share outstanding.  The total number of shares paid as a stock
dividend to our common stockholders was 39,650,815.  All common share amounts and per common share
amounts have been adjusted to reflect the common stock split.

One Billion Dollars of Dividends Paid

With
the payment of the January 2005 dividend, Realty Income and its
predecessors have paid $1 billion in common stock dividends. In addition, since
October 1994 when the Company began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, shareholders have enjoyed regular increases in the amount of the
dividend. The annualized dividend amount has grown from $0.90 per share in 1994
to $1.32 per share as of December 31, 2004, an increase of 46.7%.  The December 31, 2004 annualized
dividend amount increased by 10% as compared to the December 31, 2003
annualized dividend amount.

Common Stock Issuance

In
March 2004, we issued 3.2 million shares of common stock.  The net proceeds of $67.9 million from
this offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings on our $250
million unsecured acquisition credit facility, including amounts that were
borrowed to fund the acquisition of 112 convenience store properties in March 2004.

Class D Preferred Stock Issuance

In May 2004, we issued
4.0 million shares of 7.375% Monthly Income Cumulative Redeemable Class D
preferred stock with a liquidation value of $25 per share.  The issuance price was $25 per share and the
net proceeds of approximately $96.4 million were used to redeem our
outstanding Class B and C preferred stock, repay borrowings under our
$250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.

In
October 2004, we issued an additional 1.1 million shares of 7.375% Class D
preferred stock for $25.4311 per share. 
The net proceeds of $27.4 million were used to repay borrowings on
our $250 million unsecured credit facility, which had been used for recent
acquisitions of new retail properties.


Class B Preferred Stock Redemption

In
June 2004, we redeemed all of the 2,745,700 outstanding shares of our Class B
preferred stock for $68.6 million. 
Each share was redeemed at a liquidation value of $25.00, plus accrued
and unpaid dividends at the time of the redemption.

In
addition, when our Class B preferred stock was redeemed, we incurred a non-cash
charge of $2.4 million representing the Class B preferred stock original
issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income
available to common stockholders in June 2004.

Class C Preferred Stock Redemption

On
July 30, 2004 we redeemed all of the 1,380,000 outstanding shares of our
Class C preferred stock for $34.5 million.  Each share was redeemed at a liquidation
value of $25.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends at the time of the redemption.

In
addition, when our Class C preferred stock was redeemed, we incurred a non-cash
charge of $1.4 million representing the Class C preferred stock
original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to
net income available to common stockholders in July 2004.

Realty Income and Crest Net Aggregate Acquisitions

Realty
Income and Crest Net invested $215.3 million in aggregate in 194 new properties
and properties under development in 2004. These 194 properties are located in
19 states and are 100% leased with an initial average lease term of 17.5 years.

In
February 2005, we invested $67.3 million in a portfolio of 24 properties
leased to Rite Aid Corporation.  We
acquired existing stores that are net-leased to Rite Aid with an average
remaining lease term of 14.2 years. Realty Income plans to hold approximately
$58 million in its core portfolio as long-term investments and approximately
$9 million was acquired by Crest Net lease.

Realty Income Acquisitions

Realty Income invested
$193.8 million during 2004 in 172 new properties and properties under
development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.5%.
These 172 properties are located in 18 states and are 100% leased with an
initial average lease term of 17.5 years and will contain over 913,000 leasable
square feet.

Of
the $193.8 million Realty Income invested in real estate during 2004,
$11.1 million was invested in properties under development that were
acquired before 2004. Estimated unfunded development costs on Realty Income and
Crest Net properties under development at December 31, 2004 totaled $13.0 million.
At December 31, 2004, five new properties acquired during 2004 were leased
and under contract for development by the tenant (with development costs funded
by Realty Income or Crest Net) with rent scheduled to begin at various times
during 2005.

The
initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated
contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the
base rent or, in the case of

properties

under development, the estimated base rent under the lease) for the first year
of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs. Since it is possible that
a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot assure you
that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages
listed above.

The
172 new properties acquired by Realty Income are net-leased to 12 different
retail chains in seven industries: automotive collision service, automotive
service, convenience store, health and fitness, motor vehicle dealerships,
restaurant, and sporting goods.


Crest Net Acquisitions

Crest
Net invested $21.5 million during 2004 in 22 new retail properties and
properties under development.

Investments in Existing Properties

In
2004, we capitalized costs of $1.1 million on existing properties in our
portfolio, consisting of $323,000 for re-leasing costs and $789,000 for
building improvements.

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders was $90.2 million in 2004 versus
$76.7 million in 2003, an increase of $13.5 million. On a diluted per
common share basis, net income was $1.15 per share in 2004 as compared to $1.08
per share in 2003.  During 2004, net
income available to common stockholders included one-time, non-cash charges
totaling $3.8 million, or approximately, $0.05 per share.  These non-cash charges represent the Class B
and Class C preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and
recorded as a reduction in net income available to common stockholders in 2004
when the preferred stock was redeemed.

The calculation to determine net income available to
common stockholders includes gains and losses from the sale of investment
properties. The amount of gains and losses varies from period to period based
on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income
available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment
properties during 2004 was $12.7 million as compared to $7.2 million
during 2003.

Funds from Operations (FFO)

In 2004, our FFO
increased by $14.8 million, or 14.3%, to $118.2 million versus
$103.4 million in 2003.  On a
diluted per common share basis, FFO was $1.50 in 2004 compared to $1.45 for
2003, an increase of $0.05, or 3.4%.  Included
in FFO per diluted common share for 2004 was $0.08 per share in non-cash charges
for property impairments and origination costs on redeemed preferred stock. For
2004, non-cash charges for property impairments of $2.4 million equated to
$0.03 in FFO per diluted common share and non-cash charges for origination
costs on redeemed preferred stock of $3.8 million equated to $0.05 in FFO
per diluted common share.

FFO for 2003 has been
adjusted to reflect additional impairments on the sale of certain
properties.  These additional impairments
relate to properties where a contract for the sale of a property and the
closing of the sale transaction occurred during the same quarterly period. As
these transactions were contracted for and closed during the same quarter,
losses on the sales were booked and reflected in the Company’s financial
statements, but no impairments were booked on these properties in the Company’s
calculation of FFO.  The Company now
believes that such impairments on property sales should be deducted from the
calculation of FFO.  FFO for 2003 was reduced by $672,000 or $0.01 per
share.  The losses from these
transactions were previously included in the Company’s calculation of net income
and, as such, have no impact on the Company’s previously reported consolidated
statements of income or consolidated balance sheets for these periods.

See
our discussion of FFO in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual
report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common
stockholders to FFO.

Crest Net
Property Sales

During 2004 Crest Net
sold 51 properties from its inventory for $75.0 million, which resulted in a
gain of $10.3 million.

Crest Net’s
Property Inventory

Crest Net’s property
inventory at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 totaled
$10.1 million and $53.3 million, respectively, and is included in
real estate held for sale, net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The
financial statements of Crest Net are consolidated into Realty Income’s
financial statements. All material intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.


Sales of
Investment Properties by Realty Income

During
2004, we sold or exchanged 43 properties and a portion of land from four
properties for an aggregate of $35.4 million, which resulted in gains on
sales, of $12.7 million on 38 properties and impairments of
$1.7 million on five properties. The 43 properties sold consisted of 16
child care facilities, 13 restaurants, 10 convenience stores, three consumer
electronics stores and one automotive service location. Of this gain on sales,
$12.5 million is included in discontinued operations and $185,000 is
included in other revenue. The net proceeds from the sale of these properties
were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to
invest in new properties.

Increases in Monthly Cash Distributions to Common
Stockholders

We
continue our 35-year policy of paying distributions monthly. Monthly
distributions per share were increased by $0.000625 in April 2004 to
$0.100625, in July 2004 to $0.10125, in October 2004 to $0.109375 and
in January 2005 to $0.11. The monthly distributions were also increased by
$0.0075 per share in September 2004 to $0.10875.  The increase in January 2005 was our 29

th

consecutive quarterly increase and the 32

nd

increase in the
amount of our cash dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. In 2004, we
paid the following monthly cash distributions per share; three in the amount of
$0.10, three in the amount of $0.100625, two in the amount of $0.10125, one in
the amount of $0.10875 and three in the amount of $0.109375, totaling
$1.24125 per share. In December 2004, January 2005 and February 2005,
we declared distributions of $0.11 per share, which were paid on January 18,
2005, on February 15, 2005 and will be paid on March 15, 2005,
respectively.

The
monthly distribution of $0.11 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of $1.32 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 5.3% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on
the NYSE of $24.84 on February 15, 2005. Although we expect to continue
our policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain the current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share, or what the actual distribution yield
will be in any future period.

DISTRIBUTION
POLICY

Distributions
are paid to our common stockholders and Class D preferred stockholders on a
monthly basis if, as and when declared by our Board of Directors. The Class D
preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7.375% per
annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.84375 per
annum per share).

In
order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating
annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains) and we are
subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2004, our cash distributions
totaled $106.5 million, or approximately 107.8% of our estimated REIT
taxable income of $98.8 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income
reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. We intend to
continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet
this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income
taxes. Our 2004 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled
$97.4 million, representing 82.4% of our funds from operations available
to common stockholders of $118.2 million.

Future
distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will
depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from
operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements and any other factors
the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility
contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions
payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results of operations or
financial condition, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the
common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to
any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our
credit facility.


Distributions of our
current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes,
generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the
extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or that
such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate
of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend
income” has generally been reduced to 15% (for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2002). In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced
tax rate on corporate dividends, except to the extent the REIT’s dividends are
attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as our
taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net), to income that was subject to tax at the
corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we
retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year) or, as discussed above,
dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends.” Distributions
in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable
reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock. Distributions above that
basis, generally, will be taxable as a capital gain. Approximately 4.7% of the
distributions, made or deemed to have been made in 2004, to our common
stockholders were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax
purposes. We are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may
be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

Investment Philosophy

We
believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of retail
properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable
income.  Under a net-lease agreement, the
tenant agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses (taxes,
maintenance and insurance) plus, typically, future rent increases (generally
subject to ceilings) based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed
increases, or to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of
the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio
of properties under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant’s responsibility
for property expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than
many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the
potential for growth in rental income.

Investment Strategy

In
identifying new properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing
expansion capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring, then
leasing back, retail store locations. We categorize retail tenants as:
1) venture market, 2) middle market, and 3) upper market.
Venture companies typically offer a new retail concept in one geographic region
of the country and operate between five and 50 retail locations. Middle market
retail chains typically have 50 to 500 retail locations, operations in more
than one geographic region, have been successful through one or more economic
cycles, and have a proven, replicable concept. The upper market retail chains
typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations, operating
nationally, in a proven, mature retail concept. Upper market retail chains
generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of
capital.

Realty
Income primarily focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail
chains that we believe are attractive for investment because:

•

They
generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that
can adversely affect venture retailers;

•

They
typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing
options;

•

They
generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time
since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as their
businesses have matured;

•

Their
relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater
number of stores; and

•

Middle
market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of
locations are closed due to underperformance.

We
also focus on and have selectively made investments in properties of upper
market retail chains. We believe upper market retail chains can be attractive
for investment because:

•

They
typically are of a higher credit quality;

•

They
usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly recognized brand
names;

•

They
utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square feet;
and

•

They
are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction
sizes.


While
our investment strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to
middle and upper market retail chains, we also selectively seek investment
opportunities with venture market retail chains. Periodically, venture market
opportunities arise where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is
high quality and can be purchased at favorable prices. To meet our stringent
investment standards, however, venture retail companies must have a
well-defined retailing concept and strong financial prospects. These
opportunities are examined on a case by case basis and we are highly selective in
making investments in this area.

Historically, our
investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component
because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more
stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31,
2004, approximately 81.6% of our rental revenue rent was derived from retailers
with a service component in their business. Furthermore, we believe these
service-oriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the Internet
and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from
Internet businesses.

Credit Strategy

We
generally provide sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade retail
chains. From 1970 through December 31, 2004, we have acquired and leased
back to regional and national retail chains 1,678 properties (including 177
properties that have been sold) and have collected approximately 98% of the
original contractual rent obligations on those properties. We believe that
within this market we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return on the
financing we provide to retailers.

We
believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include
their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate
lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a
tenant conducts its retail business, we believe the risk of default on a
retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general
obligations. It has been our experience that since retailers must retain their
profitable retail locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization
they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this
would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner,
we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in
the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during
reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or
sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real
estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the
retailers’ individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations
that are weaker performers.

In
order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must
meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate
attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.  We have established a three-part analysis
that examines each potential investment based on:

•

Industry,
company, market conditions and credit profile;

•

Location
profitability, if profitability data is available; and

•

Overall
real estate characteristics, including value and comparative rental rates.

The
typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for
acquisition are those with 50 or more retail locations.  Generally the properties:

•

Are
located in highly visible areas,

•

Have
easy access to major thoroughfares; and

•

Have
attractive demographics.

Acquisition Strategy

We
seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and
national chains are capturing market share through service, quality control,
economies of scale, advertising and the selection of prime retail locations. We
execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional
and national retail chain store owners and operators, doing business in a
variety of industries, by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations. We
undertake thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries,
tenants and property locations for investment. Our research expertise is
instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real
estate financing program adds value. In selecting real estate for potential
investment, we generally seek to acquire properties that have the following
characteristics:

•

Freestanding,
commercially-zoned property with a single tenant;

•

Properties
that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains;

•

Properties
that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business
of their tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;
and

•

Properties
that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of
long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential
for rent increases.


Portfolio Management Strategy

The
active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our
long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for changes that could
affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have
invested. The portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing its
returns and enhancing its credit quality. Our executives review industry
research, tenant research, property due diligence and significant portfolio
management activities. This monitoring typically includes regular review and
analysis of:

•

The
performance of various retail industries; and

•

The
operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the tenants.

We
have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate
higher returns, enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio, or
extend our average remaining lease term. At December 31, 2004, we
classified real estate with a carrying amount of $17.2 million as held for
sale, which includes $10.1 million in properties owned by Crest Net.
Additionally, we anticipate selling properties from our portfolio that have not
yet been specifically identified. We anticipate we will receive between $15
million and $35 million in proceeds from the sale of investment properties
during the next 12 months and we intend to invest these proceeds into new
property acquisitions. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties
during the next 12 months.

Conservative Capital Structure

We
believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital
structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our
balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February 15,
2005, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes
were $571.0 million or approximately 21.3% of our total market
capitalization of $2.68 billion. We define our total market capitalization
at February 15, 2005 as the sum of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 79,581,373 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $24.84 per share, or $1.98
billion;

•

Liquidation
value of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

•

Outstanding
borrowings of $91.0 million on our credit facility; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $480.0 million.

Historically,
we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock,
preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes. Over the long term, we believe
that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of
common stock, however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that
our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to
be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue
common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit
facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have
access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

We
have a $250 million revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2005.
At February 15, 2005, the outstanding balance on the acquisition credit
facility was $91.0 million, with an effective interest rate of
approximately 3.5%. A commitment fee of 0.2% per annum accrues on the total
$250 million credit commitment of the credit facility. The credit facility has
been, and is expected to be, used to acquire additional retail properties
leased to regional and national retail chains under long-term, net-lease
agreements. The credit facility has also been used to provide capital to
subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the acquisition of properties.  We regularly evaluate our credit facility and
may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem
appropriate.


We
use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property
acquisitions. When outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a
certain level (generally in the range of $100 million to $150 million) and
capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those
borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may
include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible preferred
stock, debt securities or convertible debt securities. We cannot assure you,
however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market
conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity
or debt securities upon acceptable terms.

We
are currently assigned investment grade credit ratings, on our senior unsecured
notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &
Poor’s Rating Group. Currently, Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB,
Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a
rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have been assigned a “stable”
outlook.

We
have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating
agencies on our preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB-, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard & Poor’s
Rating Group has assigned a rating of BBB- to our preferred stock.  All of these ratings have been assigned a “stable”
outlook.

The
credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our
results of operations and financial condition.

We
have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or
Unconsolidated Investments

Realty
Income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet
investments in “variable interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor
do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or
other derivative instruments.

As
we have no joint ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatorily
redeemable preferred stock, our financial position or results of operations are
currently not affected by Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation
No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150,

Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.

Competitive Strategy

We
believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we
must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:

•

Size and Type of Investment Properties:

We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000)
net-leased retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in
today’s real estate environment. Due to the complexities of acquiring and
managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets, we believe these types
of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest
or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger income-producing
properties. We believe the less intensive day-to-day property management
required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management of a large
portfolio of smaller properties, is an effective investment strategy. The
tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide goods and
services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they
generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the
single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers, our method of
purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease
arrangement, allows the retail chain to free up capital.

•

Investment in New Retail Industries:

Though we specialize in single-tenant
properties, we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of
retail industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail
industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find
attractive. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, retail
industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and
national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by
consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing
on major demographic shifts in a population base. During 2004, we added two new
industries, financial services and motor vehicle dealerships, to our portfolio.


•

Diversification:

Diversification of the portfolio by retail
industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of
providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore further
diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December 31,
2004, our retail property portfolio consisted of 1,533 properties located in 48
states, leased to 93 retail chains doing business in 30 industry segments. Each
of the 30 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio,
individually accounted for no more than 19.6% of our rental revenue for the
quarter ended December 31, 2004.

•

Management Specialization:

We believe that our management’s
specialization in single-tenant retail properties, operated under net-lease
agreements, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this
specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in
this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.

•

Technology:

We intend to stay at the forefront of technology
in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our operations. We
maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our
portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that
technology and information-based systems will play an increasingly important
role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a
variety of industries and tenants.

PROPERTIES

At
December 31, 2004, we owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,533 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 97.9%, or 1,501 properties occupied of the 1,533
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 93 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 11.9 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 7,800 square feet.

In
addition to our real estate portfolio at December 31, 2004, our
subsidiary, Crest Net had invested $10.1 million in a portfolio of eight
retail properties located in five states. These properties are classified as held
for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.

At
December 31, 2004, 1,497, or 97.7%, of our 1,533 retail properties were
owned under net-lease agreements. Net leases typically require the tenant to be
responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including
property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically
responsible for future rent increases (generally subject to ceilings) based on
increases in the consumer price index, fixed increases or , to a lesser degree,
additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a
specified level.

Our
net-leased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national
retail chain store operators. Most buildings are single-story structures with
adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods. The
properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic
counts and adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base
constituting a suitable market or trade area for the retailer’s business.


The
following table sets forth certain information regarding our properties
classified according to the business of the respective tenants, expressed as a
percentage of our total rental revenue:

* Less than 0.1%

(1)

Includes rental revenue for all properties
owned by Realty Income at the end of each period presented (including revenue
from properties reclassified to discontinued operations) and excludes
properties owned by our subsidiary, Crest Net.

subsidiary, Crest Net.

(2)

Includes rental revenue for all properties
owned by Realty Income at December 31, 2004 (including revenue from
properties reclassified to discontinued operations of $144).


Of
the 1,533 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2004, 1,528 were
single-tenant properties with the remaining properties being multi-tenant
properties. At December 31, 2004, 1,497 of the 1,528 single-tenant
properties, or 98.0%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease
term (excluding extension options) of approximately 12.0 years.

discontinued operations and excludes revenue of $1,574 from four multi-tenant
properties and from 32 vacant and unleased properties at December 31,

Description of Leasing Structure

At
December 31, 2004, 1,497 or 97.7% of our 1,533 properties were net leased.
In most cases, the leases:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses
(taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on increases in
the consumer price index, fixed increases, or to a lesser degree, additional
rent based upon the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. Where leases
provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index,
generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent. Where
leases provide for percentage rent, this additional rent is typically payable
only if the tenants’ gross sales, for a given period (usually one year), exceed
a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the
amount of gross sales in excess of that level.

Matters Pertaining to Certain Properties and
Tenants

Of
the 32 properties available for lease or sale at December 31, 2004; all
but one are single-tenant properties. Twelve of the properties had been
previously leased to child care operators, eight to consumer electronic stores,
seven to restaurant operators, three to shoe store operators, one to an
automotive service operator and one to a grocery store operator.  At December 31, 2004, eleven of our
properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the
tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations.

For
2004, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental
revenue.  Our tenants in the convenience
store and child care industries accounted for approximately 19.2% and 14.4%,
respectively, of our rental revenue for the year 2004. Individually, each of
the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of
our rental revenue.  A downturn in any of
these industries, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the
United States, could adversely affect tenants in these industries, which in
turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of
operations, ability to make distributions to stockholders and our ability to
make debt service payments.

A
substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market retail chains
that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain
upper-market retail chains, and therefore they are more likely to be adversely
affected by a downturn in their respective business or in the regional or
national economy in general.

Certain Properties Under Development

Of
the 172 properties Realty Income acquired in 2004 and the 22 properties
acquired by Crest Net in 2004, all but five were occupied at February 15,
2005. The five properties were leased and under contract for development by
each property’s tenant (with development costs funded by us or Crest Net), with
rent generally commencing when the property opens for business. In the case of
development properties, we either enter into an agreement with a retail chain
where the retailer retains a contractor to construct the improvements and we
fund the costs of that development, or we fund a developer who constructs the
improvements. In either case, there is an executed lease at the time of the
land purchase and there is a requirement to complete the construction on a
timely basis, generally within eight months after we purchase the land. The
tenant or developer generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to
the extent that they exceed the construction budget by more than a
predetermined amount. We also enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we
purchase the land, which generally requires the tenant to begin paying base
rent when the store opens for business. The base rent is calculated as a
percentage of our acquisition cost for the property, including construction
costs and capitalized interest. In 2004, Realty Income acquired nine
development properties and Crest Net acquired one development property, five of
which were generating rent as of February 15, 2005. Both Realty Income and
Crest Net will continue to pursue development opportunities under similar
arrangements.


OTHER ITEMS

Competition for Acquisition of Real Estate

We
face competition in the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect
competition from:

•

Businesses;

•

Individuals;

•

Fiduciary
accounts and plans; and

•

Other
entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some
of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial
resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish
to purchase.

The
tenants leasing our properties can face significant competition from other
operators. This competition may adversely impact:

•

That
portion, if any, of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s
revenues; and

•

The
tenants’ results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental Liabilities

Investments
in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner
of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the
presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such
liability regardless of:

•

Our
knowledge of the contamination;

•

The
timing of the contamination;

•

The
cause of the contamination; or

•

The
party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There
may be environmental problems associated with our properties, of which we are
unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of
convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil
change and tune-up facilities. These facilities, and some other of our
properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground
tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create
a potential for release of hazardous substances.

The
presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability
to sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although
our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all
applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising
from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject
to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no
assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification
obligations under the leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities
attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to
stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities
and other indebtedness.

We
have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise
aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous
substances, toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of
our present properties. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should
exist, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership
interest and to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other
indebtedness.

Since
December 1996, we have maintained an environmental insurance policy on our
property portfolio. The limit on our current policy is $10 million per
occurrence and $50 million in the aggregate, subject to a $25,000 self
insurance retention, per occurrence, for properties with underground storage
tanks and a $100,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for all other
properties. It is possible that our insurance will be insufficient to address
any particular environmental situation and that we could be unable to continue
to obtain insurance for environmental matters, at a reasonable cost or at all,
in the future.  We are currently
discussing with our environmental insurance policy provider extending and
modifying our environmental insurance policy.


Taxation of the Company

Commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we are
organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to
qualify as a “REIT” under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). However, we cannot assure you that we have
been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements
for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or
operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification
as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly
technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For
example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay
distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In
the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such
qualification.

If
we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

•

We would be
required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

We would not
be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed
to our stockholders;

•

We could be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification is lost;

•

We would no
longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

•

This
treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or
distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the
years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price
of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Even
if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we are subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a
100% tax. Our subsidiary Crest Net is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property.

Effect of Distribution Requirements

To
maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are
required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by
excluding net capital gains each year. We also are subject to tax at regular
corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.

In
addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we
fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our
ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for
the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in
prior years.

We
intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the
distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to
federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing
between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable
income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could
require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution
requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with
qualifying as a REIT.


Dilution of Common Stock

Our
future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional
capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity
securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock.
Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred
stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as
determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board of Directors may
authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other
similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interests
of holders of our common stock.

Real Estate Ownership Risks

We
are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real
estate. In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties
may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service
payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our stock. Additional
real estate ownership risks include:

•

Adverse
changes in general or local economic conditions;

•

Changes in
supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

•

Changes in
interest rates and operating expenses;

•

Competition
for tenants;

•

Changes in
market rental rates;

•

Inability to
lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

•

Renewal of
leases at lower rental rates;

•

Inability to
collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;

•

Changes in
tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact
upon the value of real estate;

•

Uninsured
property liability;

•

Property
damage or casualty losses;

•

Unexpected
expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance
with applicable federal, state and local laws;

•

Acts of
terrorism and war; and

•

Acts of God
and other factors beyond the control of our management.

Dependence on Key Personnel

We
depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of
the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material
adverse effect on our operations.

Item 2:

Properties

Information
pertaining to our properties can be found under Item 1.

Item 3:

Legal Proceedings

We
are subject to certain claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business,
the outcome of which cannot be determined at this time. In the opinion of
management, any liability we might incur upon the resolution of these claims
and lawsuits will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Item 4:

Submission of Matters to a Vote
of Secur

ity Holders

No
matters were submitted to stockholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year.


PART II

Item 5:

Market For Registrant’s Common

Equity And Related Stockholder Matters

A.  Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under
the ticker symbol “O.” The following table shows the high and low sales prices
per share for our common stock as reported by the NYSE, and distributions
declared per share of common stock for the periods indicated.

(1)
Common stock cash distributions currently are declared monthly by us based on
financial results for the prior months. 
At December 31, 2004 a distribution of $0.11 per common share had
been declared and was paid in January 2005.

After the market close on December 31,
2004, a 2-for-1 stock split, declared in November 2004, became
effective.  Common stockholders received a
dividend of an additional share of common stock for each share they owned.  The increase in the number of common shares
outstanding after the stock split is reflected for all periods presented and
all per share data has been adjusted for the stock split.

B.
There were approximately 10,600 registered holders of record of our common
stock as of February 1, 2005. We estimate that our total number of
shareholders is approximately 65,000 when we include both registered and
beneficial holders of our common stock.

Selected Financial Data

(not covered by Report of Independent

(1)  Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges is
calculated by dividing earnings by fixed charges.  For this purpose, earnings consist of net
income before interest expense.  Fixed
charges are comprised of interest costs (including capitalized interest) and
the amortization of debt issuance costs.  In computing the ratio of earnings to combined
fixed chares and preferred stock cash dividends, preferred stock cash dividends
consist of dividends on our Class B preferred stock, Class C preferred stock
and our outstanding Class D preferred stock. 
We redeemed our Class B preferred stock in June 2004 and our Class
C preferred stock in July 2004, we issued 4,000,000 shares of our 7-3/8%
Class D preferred stock in May 2004 and we issued 1,100,000 shares of our
7-3/8% Class D preferred stock in October 2004.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

GENERAL

Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is a Maryland corporation
organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, or REIT.  Our primary business objective is to generate
dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level
of funds from operations, or FFO, per share. 
The monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our
portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail
chains.  We have in-house acquisition, leasing, legal, retail and real estate research,
portfolio management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 36
years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning
freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under long-term
lease agreements (primarily 15- to 20-years).

We also seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per
share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of
additional properties. At December 31, 2004, we owned a diversified
portfolio:

•

Of
1,533 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 97.9%, or 1,501 properties occupied of the 1,533
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 93 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 11.9 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space per property of 7,800 square feet.

Of the 1,533 properties in the portfolio, 1,528
are single-tenant, retail properties and the remaining five are multi-tenant
properties. At December 31, 2004, 1,497, or 98.0%, of the 1,528
single-tenant properties were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term
(excluding extension options) of approximately 12.0 years.

In
addition, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc.,
owned eight properties with a total investment of $10.1 million at December 31,
2004. These properties are classified as held for sale.  Crest Net was created to buy, own and sell
properties, primarily to individual investors, many of whom are involved in
tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL

RESOURCES

Cash Reserves

Realty
Income is organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases
properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash
distributions, a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases
on its retail properties. We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as
working capital. At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents
totaling $2.1 million.

We
believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating
activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for
the foreseeable future, except that we intend, however, to use additional
sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our credit
facility.

$250 Million Bank Credit Facility

We
have a $250 million revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2005.
Realty Income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing
under the $250 million credit facility at the London Interbank Offered
Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 90 basis points with a facility fee
of 20 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 110 basis points over
LIBOR.  At February 15, 2005, we had
a borrowing capacity of $159.0 million available on our credit facility
and an outstanding balance of $91.0 million at an effective interest rate
of 3.5%.  We regularly evaluate our
credit facility and may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility,
to the extent we deem appropriate.


The
credit facility is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties
and for other corporate purposes.  Any
additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.

We
have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.

Universal Shelf Registration of $800 Million

In
February 2004, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the
SEC registering the issuance, from time to time, of up to $800 million in
aggregate value of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.  At February 15, 2005,
$600.4 million remained available for issuance under our universal shelf
registration statement.

Issuance of Common Stock in 2004

In
March 2004, we issued 3.2 million shares of common stock. The net proceeds
of $67.9 million were used to repay borrowings under our $250 million
acquisition credit facility, including amounts that were borrowed to fund the
acquisition of 112 convenience store properties in March 2004.

Common Stock Split

Realty Income completed a 2-for-1 stock split after the market close on
December 31, 2004. As a result of the stock split, total outstanding
shares were increased from approximately 39.65 million shares to 79.30 million
shares.

Issuance of Preferred Stock in 2004

In

May 2004, we issued 4.0 million shares of 7.375% Monthly Income Class D
cumulative redeemable preferred stock, with a liquidation value of $25 per
share.  The net proceeds of
$96.4 million from this issuance were used to redeem a portion of the
outstanding Class B and Class C preferred stock, repay borrowings outstanding
under our $250 million acquisition credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.  Dividends on the
Class D preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears.

In
October 2004, we issued an additional 1.1 million shares of 7.375% Class D
preferred stock for $25.4311 per share. 
The net proceeds of $27.4 million were used to repay borrowings on our
$250 million acquisition credit facility.

Redemption of Class B and Class C
Preferred Stock

In
June 2004, we redeemed all of the 2,745,700 outstanding shares of our
9-3/8% Class B preferred stock at par ($25 per share) and on July 30,
2004, we redeemed all of the 1,380,000 outstanding shares of our 9-1/2%
Class C preferred stock at par ($25 per share).

Conservative Capital Structure

We
believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital
structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our
balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February 15,
2005, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes
were $571.0 million or approximately 21.3% of our total market
capitalization of $2.68 billion. We define our total market capitalization
at February 15, 2005 as the sum of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 79,581,373 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $24.84 per share, or $1.98
billion;

•

Liquidation
value of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

•

Outstanding
borrowings of $91.0 million on our credit facility; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $480.0 million.

Historically,
we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock,
preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes. Over the long term, we believe
that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of
common stock, however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that
our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to
be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue
common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit
facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have
access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.


Credit Agency Ratings

We
are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior
unsecured notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and
Standard & Poor’s Rating Group. Currently, Fitch Ratings has assigned a
rating of BBB, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard & Poor’s
has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have
been assigned a “stable” outlook.

We
have also been assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating
agencies on our preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB-,
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. has assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard
& Poor’s Rating Group has assigned a rating of BBB- to our preferred
stock.  All of these ratings have been
assigned a “stable” outlook.

The
credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our
results of operations and financial condition.

Notes Outstanding

In
November 2003, we issued $150 million of 5-1/2%, 12-year, senior unsecured
notes due 2015 (the “2015 Notes”). 
Interest on the 2015 Notes is paid semiannually.

In
March 2003, we issued $100 million of 5-3/8%, 10-year, senior unsecured
notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”). 
Interest on the 2013 Notes is paid semiannually.

In
January 1999, we issued $20 million of 8% senior unsecured notes due 2009
(the “2009

Notes”).
Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semiannually.

In October 1998, we issued $100 million of
8-1/4% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2008 (the “2008 Notes”). Interest
on the 2008 Notes is payable monthly. The 2008 Notes are unsecured.

In May 1997, we issued $110 million of 7-3/4%
senior unsecured notes due 2007 (the “2007 Notes”). Interest on the 2007 Notes
is payable semiannually.

All of these notes contain various covenants,
including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our
debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on
incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total
adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence of any
debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 1.5
times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not
less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We have been in compliance
with these covenants since each of the notes were issued.

All of our outstanding notes have fixed interest
rates.  Our credit facility interest rate
is variable.

The following table summarizes the maturity of
each of our obligations as of December 31, 2004, dollars in millions:

Table of Obligations

(1) The credit facility balance was $91.0
million as of February 15, 2005.

(2) Interest on credit facility and notes has
been calculated based on outstanding balances as of December 31, 2004
through their respective maturity dates.

(3) Other consists of $13.0 million of estimated
unfunded costs on properties under development and $1.0 million of contingent
payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs.


Our credit facility and note obligations are
unsecured.  Accordingly, we have not
pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations.

Preferred Stock Outstanding

In
May 2004, we issued 4.0 million shares of 7.375% Class D cumulative redeemable
preferred stock.  Beginning May 27, 2009,
the Class D preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share,
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. 
Dividends on the Class D preferred are paid monthly in arrears. The
net proceeds of $96.4 million from this issuance were used to redeem a
portion of the outstanding Class B and Class C preferred stock, repay
borrowings outstanding under our $250 million acquisition credit facility
and for other general corporate purposes.

In
October 2004, we issued an additional 1.1 million shares of 7.375% Class D
preferred stock.  The net proceeds of
approximately $27.4 million were used to repay borrowings under our
$250 million unsecured acquisition credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.

No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or
Unconsolidated Investment

Realty
Income and its subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet
investments in “variable interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor
do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or
other derivative instruments.

As
we have no joint ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatorily
redeemable preferred stock, our financial position or results of operations are
currently not affected by Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation
No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150,

Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.

Acquisitions During 2004

Realty Income and Crest Net

Realty
Income and Crest Net invested $215.3 million in aggregate in 194 new properties
and properties under development in 2004. These 194 properties are located in
19 states and are 100% leased with an initial average lease length of 17.5
years.

Realty Income

Realty
Income invested $193.8 million in 172 new properties and properties under
development with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.5% in
2004. These 172 properties are located in 18 states and are 100% leased with an
initial average lease length of 17.5 years and will contain over 913,000
leasable square feet.

Of
the $193.8 million Realty Income invested in real estate during 2004,
$11.1 million was invested in properties under development that were
acquired before 2004. Estimated unfunded development costs on Realty Income and
Crest Net properties under development at December 31, 2004 totaled
$13.0 million. At December 31, 2004, five new properties acquired
during 2004 were leased and under contract for development by the tenant (with
development costs funded by Realty Income or Crest Net) with rent scheduled to
begin at various times during 2005.

The
initial weighted average contractual lease rate on our investments is computed
as estimated contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property this is
equal to the base rent or, in the case of

properties

under development, the estimated base rent under the lease) for the first year
of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs. Since it is possible that
a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot assure you
that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages
listed above.


The
172 new properties acquired by Realty Income are net-leased to 12 different
retail chains in seven industries: automotive collision service, automotive
service, convenience store, health and fitness, motor vehicle dealerships,
restaurant and sporting goods. During 2004, we added two new industries (motor
vehicle dealerships and financial services) to our portfolio.

Crest Net

Crest
Net invested $21.5 million during 2004 in 22 new retail properties and
properties under development.

Investments in Existing Properties

In
2004, we capitalized costs of $1.1 million on existing properties in our
portfolio, consisting of $323,000 for re-leasing costs and $789,000 for
building improvements

Sales of
Investment Properties

During
2004, we sold or exchanged 43 properties and sold a portion of land from four
properties for an aggregate of $35.4 million, which resulted in gains on
sales of $12.7 million for 38 properties and impairments of $1.7 million
on five properties. The 43 properties sold consisted of 16 child care
facilities, 13 restaurants, 10 convenience stores, three consumer electronics
stores and one automotive service location. Of this gain on sales, $12.5 million
is included in discontinued operations and $185,000 is included in other
revenue. The net proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility and to invest in new
properties.

Crest Net
Property Sales

During
2004, Crest Net, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sold 51 properties from its
inventory for $75.0 million, which resulted in a gain of
$10.3 million.

Crest Net’s
Property Inventory

Crest Net’s property
inventory at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 totaled
$10.1 million and $53.3 million, respectively, and is included in
real estate held for sale, net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The
financial statements of Crest Net are consolidated into Realty Income’s
financial statements. All material intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Increases in Monthly Cash Distributions to Common
Stockholders

We
continue our 35-year policy of paying distributions monthly. Monthly
distributions per share were increased by $0.000625 in April 2004 to
$0.100625, in July 2004 to $0.10125, in October 2004 to $0.109375 and
in January 2005 to $0.11. The monthly distributions were also increased by
$0.0075 per share in September 2004 to $0.10875.  The increase in January 2005 was our 29th
consecutive quarterly increase and the 32nd increase in the amount of our cash
dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. In 2004, we paid the following
monthly cash distributions per share; three in the amount of $0.10, three in
the amount of $0.100625, two in the amount of $0.10125, one in the amount of
$0.10875 and three in the amount of $0.109375, totaling $1.24125 per
share. In December 2004, January 2005 and February 2005, we
declared distributions of $0.11 per share, which were paid on January 18,
2005, on February 15, 2005 and will be paid on March 15, 2005,
respectively.

The
monthly distribution of $0.11 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of $1.32 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 5.3% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on
the NYSE of $24.84 on February 15, 2005. Although we expect to continue
our policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain the current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share, or what the actual distribution yield
will be in any future period.

Stock and Senior Debt Purchase Program

In
January 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $10
million of our outstanding common and preferred shares and senior debt
securities. From time to time since January 2000, we concluded that our
share price justified purchasing shares since this provided an attractive
return on our investment capital. We purchased an aggregate of $6.7 million of
our securities in 2000 and 2001. We have not purchased any of our securities
after 2001, but may do so from time to time in the future.


RESULTS OF OPE

RATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our consolidated financial
statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements
requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We
believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate
manner in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We
continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our
historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that
they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ
from these estimates and assumptions.

In
order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules
and guidelines set forth by GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with
regard to critical accounting polices. One of these judgments is our estimate
for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties.
Depreciation of buildings and improvements is computed using the straight-line
method over an estimated useful life of 25 years. If we use a shorter or longer
estimated useful life it could have a material impact on our results of
operations. We believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life.
No depreciation has been recorded on Crest Net’s properties because they are
classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.

Another
significant judgment that must be made is the impairment losses taken on our
properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a provision is made for
impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted)
are less than the current book value. Impairment losses are measured as the
amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of
carrying cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The carrying value
of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet.
If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real
estate by recording provisions for impairment losses, it could have a material
impact on our results of operations.

The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Rental Revenue

Rental
revenue was $174.4 million for 2004 versus $144.7 million for 2003, an increase
of $29.7 million, or 20.6%. Rental revenue was $129.2 million in 2002. The
increase in rental revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 is attributable to:

•

The
172 retail properties acquired by Realty Income in 2004, which generated
$9.4 million in 2004;

•

The
241 retail properties acquired by Realty Income in 2003, which generated $26.4
million in 2004 compared to $7.6 million in 2003, an increase of $18.8 million;

•

Same
store rents generated on 1,052 properties during 2004 and 2003 increased by
$2.4 million, or 1.8%, to $132.3 million from $129.9 million.  These properties were leased during all of
both 2004 and 2003;

•

An
increase in straight-line rent of $176,000 in 2004 as compared to 2003; and

•

A
decrease of $771,000 relating to the aggregate of (i) development properties
acquired before 2003 that started paying rent in 2003, (ii) properties that
were vacant during part of 2003 or 2004 and (iii) lease termination
settlements.  These items in aggregate
totaled $5.5 million in 2004 and $6.3 million in 2003.

Realty
Income acquired 172 retail properties in 2004, excluding Crest Net
acquisitions, and as a result, our 2004 operating results included less than a
full year of rental revenue from these properties.  Accordingly, we anticipate that the
contribution to rental revenue from these 172 properties will increase in 2005,
because 2005 will include a full year of rent from these properties.


Of
the 1,533 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2004, 1,528, or
99.7%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining properties are
multi-tenant properties. Of the 1,528 single-tenant properties, 1,497, or
98.0%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding
rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately
12.0 years at December 31, 2004. Of our 1,497 leased single-tenant
properties, 1,381, or 92.3%, were under leases that provide for increases in
rents through:

•

Base rent
increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings;

•

Fixed
increases;

•

To a lesser
degree; overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales; or

•

A
combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage
rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $1.3 million in 2004, $1.1
million in 2003 and $1.5 million in 2002. Percentage rent in 2004 was less
than 1% of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1%
of rental revenue in 2005.

Our portfolio of
retail real estate, leased primarily to regional and national chains under net
leases, continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue
supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders.  At December 31, 2004, our portfolio of
1,533 retail properties was 97.9% leased with 32 properties available for
lease, one of which is a multi-tenant property. Transactions to lease or sell
17 of the 32 properties available for lease at December 31, 2004 were
underway or completed as of February 15, 2005. We anticipate these
transactions will be completed during the next six months, although we cannot
guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this
period. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 3% of our property
portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, we cannot assure you
that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels.

Interest Expense

Interest
expense was $7.7 million higher in 2004 than in 2003 primarily due to higher
average outstanding note balances. Interest expense was $23.1 million in
2002.  The following is a summary of the
five components of our interest expense (dollars in thousands):

Interest
on outstanding credit facilities and notes increased by $7.5 million in 2004 as
compared to 2003 primarily due to higher average outstanding note balances in
2004 . In 2002, unamortized fees of $406,000 relating to our previous credit
facilities, which were canceled in October 2002, were charged to interest
expense.


At
February 15, 2005, the weighted average interest rate on our:

•

Credit
facility borrowings of $91.0 million was 3.5%;

•

Notes
payable of $480 million was 6.7%; and

•

Combined
outstanding credit facility and notes of $571.0 million was 6.2%.

Our
notes payable were all issued at fixed interest rates and are not subject to
fluctuations in interest rates.  Interest
on credit facility borrowings is subject to fluctuations in interest rates.

Interest Coverage Ratio

Our
interest coverage ratio was 5.0 times for 2004, 5.3 times for 2003 and 5.5
times for 2002.  Interest coverage ratio
is calculated as: the interest coverage amount (as calculated in the following
table) divided by interest expense, including interest recorded to discontinued
operations. We consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate
supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense
obligations. Our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from
the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be
limited. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any
GAAP liquidity measures.

The
following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to
our interest coverage amount (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Crest
Net activities.

(2)

Includes
interest expense recorded to “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale by Crest.”


Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Our
fixed charge coverage ratio for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 3.9 times. Fixed
charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest
coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the
denominator. We consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate
supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred
stock dividend payments. Our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may
be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore,
comparability may be limited. This information should not be considered as an
alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures.

Interest
coverage amount divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends
(dollars in thousands):

(1) Excludes the Class B and Class C preferred
stock non-cash charge of $3,774 in 2004 for excess of redemption value over
carrying value of preferred shares redeemed.

(2) Includes interest expense recorded to “income
from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization was $40.3 million in 2004 versus $32.7 million in 2003 and
$29.3 million in 2002. The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to
the acquisition of properties in 2004, 2003 and 2002, which was partially
offset by property sales in these years.

General and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million to $13.1 million in 2004
versus $10.6 million in 2003. 
General and administrative expenses were $9.0 million in 2002.  In 2004, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of total revenue increased to 7.5% as compared to 7.3% in 2003
and 7.0% in 2002.  General and
administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs of
corporate insurance, payroll, employee benefits, corporate governance and
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance costs.

As
our property portfolio has grown and continues to grow, we have increased, and
anticipate that we will continue to increase, the level of our staffing. We
expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to costs
attributable to payroll, staffing costs and corporate governance. Corporate
governance costs relate to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

At
February 15, 2005, we had 69 employees, six of which are part time, plus
one contract consultant compared to 58 at February 16, 2004 and 56 at March 1,
2003.

Property Expenses

Property
expenses are broken down into costs associated with non-net leased multi-tenant
properties, unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio expenses.
Expenses related to the multi-tenant and unleased single-tenant properties
include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance,
utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. General
portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property
inspections and title search fees. At December 31, 2004, 32 properties
were available for lease, as compared to 26 at December 31, 2003 and 27 at
December 31, 2002.

Property
expenses were $3.2 million in 2004, $2.5 million in 2003 and $2.2 million in
2002. The $700,000 increase in property expenses in 2004 is primarily
attributable to an increase in costs associated with vacant properties.

Income Taxes

Income
taxes were $699,000 in 2004 as compared to $501,000 in 2003 and $496,000 in 2002.  These amounts are for city and state income
taxes paid by Realty Income.  The
increase in 2004 is due to an increase in rental revenue causing higher city
and state income tax expense.


In
addition, Crest Net incurred state and federal income taxes of $3.5 million in
2004 as compared to $2.2 million in 2003 and $1.2 million in 2002.  These increases in 2004 over the 2003 and
2002 amounts are due to greater taxable income, primarily attributable to higher
gain on sales of real estate acquired for re-sale.  These amounts are included in “income from
discontinued operations from real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Discontinued Operations

Crest Net acquires properties with the intention of reselling them
rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties.  Consequently, we classify properties acquired
by Crest Net as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate
them.  The operations of Crest Net’s
properties are classified as “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale by Crest.”  The
following is a summary of Crest Net’s “income from discontinued operations,
real estate acquired for resale” for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):

Realty
Income’s operations from six properties listed as held for sale at December 31,
2004, plus properties sold after 2001 have been classified as discontinued
operations.  The following is a summary
of our discontinued operations from real estate held for investment for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):


The
following is a summary of our total discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):

Gain on Sales
of Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest Net

(included in
discontinued operations)

In
2004, Crest Net sold 51 properties for $75.0 million, which resulted in a gain
of $10.3 million. In 2003, Crest Net sold 27 properties for $45.2 million,
which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million. 
In 2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties for $27.3 million, which resulted
in a gain of $3.5 million.  All gains on
sales of real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes.

At December 31,
2004, Crest Net had $10.1 million invested in eight properties, which are held
for sale. Our goal is for Crest Net to carry an average inventory of approximately
$20 to $25 million in real estate.  Crest
Net generates an earnings spread on the difference between the lease payments
it receives on the properties held in inventory and the cost of capital used to
acquire properties.  It is our belief
that at this level of inventory, rental revenue will exceed the ongoing
operating expenses of Crest Net without any property sales.

Gain on Sales of Investment Properties by Realty
Income

(included in discontinued operations)

In
2004, we sold or exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the
land from four properties for $35.4 million and recognized a gain on sales
of $12.7 million, of which $12.5 million is included in discontinued
operations and $185,000 is included in other revenue.  In 2003, we sold or exchanged 35 investment
properties for a total of $23.1 million and recognized a gain of
$7.2 million, which is included in discontinued operations.

In 2002, we sold or exchanged 35
properties for $20.2 million and recognized a gain of $6.5 million, of
which $6.2 million is included in discontinued operations and $349,000 is
included in other revenue.

We
have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of
assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate
higher returns, enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or
extend our average remaining lease term. At December 31, 2004, we
classified real estate with a carrying amount of $17.2 million as held for
sale, which includes $10.1 million in properties owned by Crest Net.  Additionally, we anticipate selling
investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically
identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $15 million and $35
million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these
proceeds into new property acquisitions. However, we cannot guarantee that we
will sell properties during the next 12 months.

Provisions for Impairment

Provisions for impairment of $2.4 million were recorded on six
properties in 2004 as compared to $1.2 million on 11 properties in 2003 and
$1.5 million on 10 properties in 2002. These impairment losses are included in
discontinued operations, real estate held for investment.

Two of the largest impairments taken in 2004 totaled $2.0 million.  Of the impairments recorded in 2004,
$1.3 million was attributable to a property originally leased to a shoe
store operator that filed for bankruptcy and rejected the lease.  The property was leased to a restaurant
operator who exercised a purchase option and purchased the property in December 2004.

Also in 2004, we recorded an impairment of $716,000 on one convenience
store location to reduce its carrying value to zero.  This property is classified as held for sale
on our balance sheet.  This impairment
was the result of a title insurance company failing to timely record the deed
on this property.  It is likely that
through our tenant’s bankruptcy proceedings, our title to this property will be
divested.  We believe that we have a
strong claim against the title insurance company and others for the loss of


the
current fair market value of the property, plus rent which we may be required
to repay to the tenant, and direct and incidental costs incurred.  Our claim against the title insurance company
and others is estimated to be between $750,000 and $1.3 million, which is not
reflected in our consolidated financial statements as this represents a
contingent gain.

During 2004, certain amounts were reclassified to provisions for
impairments and gain on sales of investment properties, for 2003 and 2002, that
relate to properties where a contract for the sale of a property and the
closing of the sale transaction occurred during the same quarterly period. As
these transactions were contracted for and closed during the same quarter,
losses on the sales were previously booked and reflected in the Company’s
financial statements but were not classified as impairments.  We now believe that such impairments on
property sales should be classified separately from gain on sales of investment
properties.  Provisions for impairments
and gain on sales on investment properties were both increased by $672,000 for 2003. 
Provisions for impairments and gain on sales on investment properties were both
increased by $200,000 for 2002.  The
losses from these transactions were previously included in the Company’s
calculation of net income and, as such, have no impact on our previously
reported consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets for
these periods.

Preferred Stock Cash Dividends and Redemption
Charge

We
had preferred stock cash dividends of $9.5 million in 2004 as compared to $9.7
million in 2003 and 2002.  The decrease
in 2004 is due to the redemption of our Class B preferred stock in June 2004
and the redemption of our Class C preferred stock in July 2004, which
was offset by the issuance of our Class D preferred stock in May 2004 and October 2004.

When
we redeemed our Class B preferred stock in June 2004 and our Class C
preferred stock in July 2004, we incurred non-cash charges of
$2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the excess of redemption
value over the carrying value.  These
non-cash charges represent the Class B and Class C preferred stock original
issuance costs that were paid in 1999 and recorded as a reduction to net income
available to common stockholders when the shares were redeemed.  These non-cash charges equate to $0.05 per
common share in 2004.

Net income available to common stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders in 2004 increased by $13.5 million, or
17.6%, to $90.2 million as compared to $76.7 million in 2003. Net income
available to common stockholders in 2002 was $69.0 million.

Net income available to common stockholders includes
gains and losses from the sale of investment properties by Realty Income and
properties acquired for re-sale by Crest Net.. The amount of gains and losses
varies from period to period, based on the timing of property sales, and can
significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment
properties during 2004 was $12.7 million as compared to $7.2 million during
2003 and $6.5 million in 2002.  The gain
recognized from the sale of properties acquired for re-sale during 2004 was
$10.3 million as compared to $6.2 million during 2003 and $3.5 million during
2002.


FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

(FFO)

AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

FFO
for 2004 increased by $14.8 million, or 14.3%, to $118.2 million as compared to
$103.4 million in 2003 and $93.5 million in 2002. The following is a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe
is the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)
measure) to FFO, information regarding cash distributions paid and the diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars
in thousands):

We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition, as net
income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of
assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry, reduced by gains on
sales of investment property and extraordinary items.

We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental
measure of a REIT’s operating performance as it is based on a net income
analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as
depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets
requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which
implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.
Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions,
presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for
depreciation, could be less informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the
REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used
as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit
facility.

Presentation of this information is intended to assist
the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although
it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO the same way, so
comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO is not
necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not
be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of Realty Income’s
performance. In addition, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to
reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as
a measure of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions or of our
ability to make interest payments.


Other Non-Cash Items and Capitalized Expenditures

The
following information includes non-cash items and capitalized expenditures on
existing properties in our portfolio. These items are not utilized in the adjustments
to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at funds from
operations. Analysts and investors often request this supplemental information.

(1)
Amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of
costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in May 1997, October 1998,
January 1999, March 2003 and November 2003. These costs are
being amortized over the lives of these notes. No costs associated with our
credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have
been included.

(2)
Negative amount represents that our straight-line rent was more than our actual
cash rent collected by the amount indicated.

IMPACT OF INFLATIO

N

Tenant
leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases
in the tenants’ sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index, and/or
fixed increases. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to
result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than
increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep
up with the rate of inflation.

IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING PRONO

UNCEMENTS

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payments

. Statement No. 123R requires companies to recognize in the
income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and other
equity-based compensation issued to employees. The impact of adopting Statement
No. 123R is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153,

Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB No. 29

. Statement
No. 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29 and states that companies will no longer
be permitted to use the “similar productive assets” concept to account for
nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain being recognized.  An exchange must be accounted for at fair
value if the exchange has commercial substance and fair value is
determinable.  Statement No. 153 is
not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

Item 7A

:

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

We
are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit
facility and long-term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real
estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management
objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives we
issue long-term notes, primarily at fixed rates, and may selectively enter into
derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate lock agreements,
interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a
related financial instrument. We were not a party to any derivative financial
instruments at December 31, 2004. We do not enter into any transactions
for speculative or trading purposes.


Our
interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The following
table presents by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average
interest rates, fair values as of December 31, 2004.  This information is presented to evaluate the
expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in
millions):

Expected Maturity Data

(1) The credit facility expires in October 2005.  The credit facility balance as of February 15,
2004 was $91.0 million.

(2) $110 million matures in May 2007.

(3) $100 million matures in October 2008.

(4) $20 million matures in January 2009.

(5) $100 million matures in March 2013 and
$150 million matures in November 2015.

(6) We base the fair value of the fixed rate
debt at December 31, 2004 on the closing market price or indicative price
per each note. The fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its
carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market
place.

The
table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31,
2004; it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after
that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to
interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the
period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.

All of our outstanding notes have fixed interest
rates.  Our credit facility interest rate
is variable.  Based on our credit
facility balance at December 31, 2004, a 1% change in interest rates would
change our interest costs by $236,000 per year.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Realty Income Corporation and
subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying table of contents. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
the financial statement Schedule III as listed in the accompanying table
of contents. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of Realty Income Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Realty Income Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Realty Income Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated March 3, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public

Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

,

that Realty Income Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

Realty Income Corporation’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Realty Income Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Also, in our opinion, Realty Income Corporation maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the
accompanying table of contents and our report dated March 3, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

1.

Organization and Operation

Realty Income Corporation (“Realty Income,” the “Company,”
“we” or “our”) is organized as a Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial
retail real estate and have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”).

At December 31, 2004, we owned 1,533
properties in 48 states containing over 11.9 million leasable square feet,
plus an additional eight properties owned by our wholly-owned taxable REIT
subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest Net”).

Crest Net was created to buy, own and sell properties, primarily to individual
investors, many of whom are involved in tax-deferred exchanges, under Section 1031
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“the Code”).

After the market close on December 31,
2004, a 2-for-1 stock split, declared in November 2004, became
effective.  Common stockholders received
an additional share of common stock for each share they owned.  The increase in the number of common shares
outstanding and all per common share data has been adjusted for the stock
split.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Procedures

Federal Income Taxes

. 
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. We believe we have
qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT. As a REIT, we will be permitted to
deduct distributions paid to our stockholders and generally will not be
required to pay federal corporate income taxes on such income. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, except for federal income taxes of Crest
Net, which totaled $2.8 million, $1.8 million and $1.0 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.  These taxes are
included in income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for
resale by Crest.

Earnings and profits which determine the
taxability of distributions to stockholders, differ from net income reported
for financial reporting purposes due to differences in the estimated useful
lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis)
on the investments in properties for tax purposes, among other things.

The following reconciles our net income
available to common stockholders to taxable income for 2004 (dollars in
thousands) (unaudited):


Net Income Per Common Share

. 
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is
computed by dividing the amount of net income available to common stockholders
for the period by the number of common shares that would have been outstanding
assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common
shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The following is a reconciliation of the
denominator of the basic net income per common share computation to the
denominator of the diluted net income per common share computation, for the
years ended December 31:

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, no stock options were
anti-dilutive.

Discontinued Operations

.  In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“SFAS 144”)

,
Realty Income’s operations from six investment properties classified as held
for sale at December 31, 2004, plus properties sold after 2001 were
reported as discontinued operations. 
Their respective results of operations were reclassified to income from
discontinued operations, real estate held for investment.  We classify properties as held for sale in
accordance with SFAS 144.  We do not
depreciate properties that are classified as held for sale.

Crest
Net acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than
holding them for investment and operating the properties.  Consequently, we classify properties acquired
by Crest Net as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate
them.  In accordance with SFAS 144, the
operations of Crest Net’s properties are classified as “income from
discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

No
debt was assumed by buyers of our investment properties or repaid as a result
of our investment property sales and we have elected not to allocate interest
expense to discontinued operations related to real estate held for investment.

In
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 87-24, we allocate interest
expense related to borrowings specifically attributable to Crest Net
properties.  The interest expense amounts
allocated to the Crest Net properties are included in “income from discontinued
operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

The
following is a summary of Crest Net’s “income from discontinued operations,
real estate acquired for resale” for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):


The

The
following is a summary of our total discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands):

During
2004, certain amounts were reclassified to provisions for impairments and gains
on sale of investment properties for 2003 and 2002, that relate to properties
where a contract for the sale of a property and the closing of the sale
transaction occurred during the same quarterly period. As these transactions
were contracted for and closed during the same quarter, losses on the sales
were previously booked and reflected in the Company’s financial statements but
were not classified as impairments.  We now believe that such impairments
on property sales should be classified separately from gain on sales of
investment properties.  Provisions for
impairments and gain on sales on investment properties were both increased by
$672,000 for 2003.  Provisions for impairments and gain on sales on
investment properties were both increased by $200,000 for 2002.  The
losses from these transactions were previously included in the Company’s
calculation for net income and, as such, have no impact on our previously
reported consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets for
these periods.

Leases

. 
All leases are accounted for as operating leases. Under this method,
lease payments that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any rental revenue contingent
upon a tenant’s sales is recognized only after the tenants exceed their sales
breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indexes
are recognized only after the changes in the indexes have occurred, and then
applied according to the lease agreements.

Principles of Consolidation

. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Realty Income, Crest Net and other entities for which we make operational
and financial decisions (control), after elimination of all material
intercompany balances and transactions. 
All of Realty Income’s and Crest Net’s subsidiaries are wholly-owned.

Cash Equivalents

. 
We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible to cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase to be cash equivalents..

Gain on Sales of Properties

. 
We recognize gains or losses on sales of properties in accordance with
Statement No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.


Depreciation and Amortization

. 
Depreciation of buildings and improvements are computed using the
straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years.

Maintenance and Repairs

. 
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Replacements and betterments are capitalized.

Provisions for Impairments

. 
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Generally, a provision is made for impairment if estimated future
operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated
disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value.
Impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the current book value of
the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If a property is held for sale,
it is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less cost to sell.

Provisions for impairment of $2.4 million were
recorded in 2004 on six retail properties, of which five were sold during 2004
and one is classified as held for sale. 
These properties were classified in the following industries: one in
automotive service, one in child care, two in consumer electronics, one in
convenience store and one in restaurant.

Provisions for impairment of $1.2 million were
recorded in 2003 on 11 retail properties, all of which were sold during
2003.  These properties were classified
in the following industries: one in automotive service, three in child care,
one in consumer electronics, three in home improvement and three in restaurant.

Provisions for impairment of $1.5 million were
recorded in 2002 on 10 retail properties, of which nine were sold during 2002
and one was sold in 2003.  These
properties were classified in the following industries: two in child care, two
in home improvement and six in restaurant.

All of these provisions for impairment are
included in income from discontinued operations, real estate held for
investment on our consolidated statements of income.

Stock Option Plan

. 
Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and beginning in 2002 started expensing the costs for
all stock option awards granted, modified, or settled after January 1,
2002. Stock option awards under the plan vest over periods ranging from one to
five years.

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income available to common stockholders and earnings per share if the fair
value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each
period (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):


Goodwill

. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when events or
circumstances occur indicating that our goodwill might be impaired.  We did not have any new goodwill or record
impairment on our existing goodwill during 2004, 2003 or 2002.  We do not have any intangible assets as
contemplated under Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, or unamortized negative goodwill.

Use of Estimates

. 
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

. 
Certain of the 2003 and 2002 balances have been reclassified to conform
to the 2004 presentation.

3.

Retail Properties Acquired

We
acquire land, buildings and improvements that are used by retail operators.
Generally, we do not acquire properties with in-place operating leases, nor
other forms of intangible assets.

A.  During 2004, Realty Income and Crest Net
invested $215.3 million in aggregate in 194 new retail properties and
properties under development. These 194 properties are located in 19 states,
will contain approximately 972,000 leasable square feet and are 100% leased
with an average initial lease term of 17.5 years.

In
comparison, during 2003, Realty Income and Crest Net invested $371.6 million in
aggregate in 302 new retail properties and properties under development. These
302 properties are located in 25 states, will contain approximately
1.9 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an average
initial lease term of 19.9 years.

B.  During 2004, Realty Income invested $193.8
million in 172 new retail properties and properties under development, with an
initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.5%. These 172 properties
are located in 18 states, will contain over 913,000 leasable square feet and
are 100% leased with an average initial lease term of 17.5 years.

In
comparison, during 2003, Realty Income invested $284.0 million in 242 new

states, will contain approximately 1.5 million leasable square feet and are
100% leased with an average initial lease term of 19.9 years.

C.  During 2004, Crest Net invested $21.5 million
in 22 new retail properties and properties under development.

In
comparison, during 2003, Crest Net invested $87.6 million in 60 new retail
properties and properties under development.

D.  Crest Net’s property inventory at December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003 totaled $10.1 million and
$53.3 million, respectively, and is included in real estate held for sale,
net, on our consolidated balance sheets.

4.

Credit Facilities

In October 2002,
we entered into a $250 million credit facility to replace our existing
$200 million acquisition credit facility and $25 million credit facility.
Unamortized fees of $406,000 relating to the canceled credit facilities were
charged to interest expense in 2002.

The borrowing rate on
the $250 million credit facility was reduced compared to the previous credit
facilities. As of December 31, 2004, Realty Income’s investment grade
credit ratings provide for borrowing at LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)
plus 90 basis points, with a facility fee of 20 basis points on the total of
the facility amount, for all-in drawn pricing of 110 basis points over LIBOR as
compared to an all-in drawn pricing


of 145 basis points on our previous credit
facilities. The term of our current facility extends through October 2005.

We regularly evaluate our credit
facility and may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility, to the
extent we deem appropriate.

The average borrowing rate on our credit
facilities during 2004 was 2.4%, compared to 2.2% in 2003 and 3.0% in 2002. Our
current credit facility is, and previous credit facilities were, subject to
various leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations. The Company is and
has been in compliance with these covenants.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, interest of $531,000,
$697,000 and $511,000, respectively, was capitalized with respect to properties
under development.

Our credit facility is unsecured and
accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.

5.

Notes Payable

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of
5-1/2% senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the “2015 Notes”). The notes were sold
at 99.508% of par. The net proceeds from this offering were used to acquire new
retail properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured acquisition
credit facility. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually.

In March 2003, we issued $100 million of
5-3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”). The notes were sold
at 99.509% of par. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay
borrowings under our unsecured acquisition credit facility.  Interest on the 2013 Notes is payable
semiannually.

In January 1999, we issued $20 million of
8% senior unsecured notes due 2009 (the “2009 Notes”). Interest on the 2009
Notes is payable semiannually.

In October 1998, we issued $100 million of
8-1/4% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2008 (the “2008 Notes”). In May 1998, we
entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement associated with the 2008
Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we made a payment of $8.7 million in
1998. The payment on the agreement is being amortized over 10 years (the life
of the 2008 Notes) as a yield adjustment to interest expense. After taking into
effect the results of a treasury interest rate lock agreement, the effective
rate to us on the 2008 Notes is 9.12%. Interest on the 2008 Notes is payable
monthly. The 2008 Notes are unsecured.

In May 1997, we issued $110 million of 7-3/4%
senior unsecured notes due 2007 (the “2007 Notes”). In December 1996, we
entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement associated with the 2007
Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we received $1.1 million in 1997.
The payment received on the agreement is being amortized over 10 years (the
life of the 2007 Notes) as a yield adjustment to interest expense. After taking
into effect the results of a treasury interest rate lock agreement, the
effective interest rate to us on the 2007 Notes is 7.62%.  Interest on the 2007 Notes is payable
semiannually.

Interest incurred on the 2015 Notes, 2013 Notes,
2009 Notes, 2008 Notes and 2007 Notes collectively for each of the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 was $32.0 million, $23.6 million and $18.4 million,
respectively.  The interest rate on each
of these notes is fixed.

Our outstanding notes are unsecured and
accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these or any
other obligations.

All of these notes contain various covenants,
including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our
debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on
incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total
adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence of any
debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 1.5
times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not
less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We have been in compliance
with these covenants since each of the notes were issued.


The following table summarizes the maturity of
our notes payable as of December 31, 2004, dollars in millions:

outstanding.  The net proceeds of
$96.4 million from this issuance were used to redeem a portion of the
outstanding Class B and Class C preferred stock, repay borrowings outstanding
under our $250 million acquisition credit facility and for other general
corporate purposes.  Beginning May 27,
2009, the Class D preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25.00

8.

Operating Leases

A.

At December 31, 2004, we owned 1,533
properties in 48 states, excluding eight properties owned by Crest Net. Of
these 1,533 properties, 1,528 are single-tenant retail locations and the
remainder are multi-tenant retail locations. At December 31, 2004, 32
properties were vacant and available for lease or sale.


Substantially all leases are net leases where
the tenant pays property taxes and assessments, maintains the interior and
exterior of the building and leased premises, and carries insurance coverage
for public liability, property damage, fire and extended coverage.

Percentage rent for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $1.3
million, $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, including amounts
recorded to discontinued operations.

At December 31, 2004, minimum future annual
rents to be received on the operating leases are as follows (dollars in
thousands):

B.

Major Tenants – No individual tenant’s
rental revenue, including percentage rents, represented more than 10% of our
total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

9.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate
Acquired for Resale by Crest Net

In
2004, Crest Net sold 51 properties for $75.0 million, which resulted in a
gain of $10.3 million.  In 2003,
Crest Net sold 27 properties for $45.2 million, which resulted in a gain
of $6.2 million. In 2002, Crest Net sold 23 properties for $27.3 million, which
resulted in a gain of $3.5 million.  All
gains on sales are reported before income taxes.

10.

Gain on Sales of Investment
Properties by Realty Income

During 2004, we sold or exchanged 43 investment
properties and sold a portion of the land from four properties for $35.4
million, which resulted in a gain of $12.7 million. Of this gain,
$12.5 million is included in discontinued operations and $185,000 is
included in other revenue. Included in the 43 properties was one property
leased by one of our tenants that we exchanged for another property owned by
that tenant (see note 13D).

During 2003, we sold or exchanged 35 investment
properties and exchanged three excess land parcels (from three properties) for
$23.1 million, which resulted in a gain of $7.2 million. This gain is
included in discontinued operations. Included in the 35 properties was one
property leased by one of our tenants that we exchanged for another property
owned by that tenant (see note 13E).

In 2002, we sold or exchanged 35 properties for
$20.2 million and recognized a gain of $6.5 million. Of this gain, $6.2
million is included in discontinued operations and $349,000 is included in
other revenue. Included in the 35 properties was one property leased by one of
our tenants that we exchanged for another property owned by that tenant (see
note 13F).

11.

Purchases of Realty Income
Securities

In January 2000, our Board of Directors
authorized the purchase of up to $10 million of our outstanding common stock,
preferred stock and senior debt securities. We purchased an aggregate of $6.7
million of our securities in 2000 and 2001. No securities have been purchased since
2001.


12.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

We believe that the carrying values reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 reasonably approximate
the fair values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and all
liabilities, due to their short-term nature, except for the line of credit
payable and notes payable. In making these assessments, we used estimates. The
fair value of the line of credit payable approximates its carrying value
because its terms are similar to those available in the market place. The fair
value of the notes payable at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is estimated to
be $500.9 million and $498.7 million, respectively, based upon the
closing market price per note or indicative price per each note at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

13.

Supplemental Disclosures of Cash
Flow Information

Interest paid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $31.3
million, $32.5 million and $21.4 million, respectively.

Income taxes paid by Realty Income and Crest Net
in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $6.9 million, $0.8 million and $1.7 million,
respectively.

non-cash charge of $1.4 million for the excess of redemption value over
the carrying value.

C.

Non-cash additions to properties in 2003
resulted in increases in buildings of $1.7 million, real estate held for
sale, net of $289,000 and other liabilities of $2.0 million.

D.

In
2004, we exchanged one of our properties for a different property that was

this transaction, land was reduced by $160,000, building was increased by
$78,000, and accumulated depreciation was decreased by $82,000.

E.

In 2003, we exchanged excess land parcels
from three different properties leased by one of our tenants for land (with
improvements) owned by that same tenant. In 2003, we also exchanged one

Employee Benefit Plan

We have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all
of our employees. Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to make
contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 60% of their compensation, subject
to limits under the IRS Code. We match 50% of our employee’s contributions, up
to 3% of the employee’s compensation. Our aggregate matching contributions each
year have been immaterial to our results of operations.


15.

Stock Incentive Plan

In
2003, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2003
Incentive Award Plan of Realty Income Corporation to enable us
to attract and retain the services of directors, employees and consultants
considered essential to our long-term success by offering them an
opportunity to own stock in Realty Income and/or rights which will
reflect our growth, development and financial success. Under the
terms of this plan, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject
to options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights and
other awards will be no more than 3,428,000 shares. The maximum number of
shares which may be subject to options, stock purchase rights, stock
appreciation rights and other awards granted under the plan to any
individual in any calendar year may not exceed 1,600,000 shares. This plan
has a term of 10 years from the date it was adopted by our Board of
Directors. In 2003, there were no grants made under this plan. In 2004,
25,600 restricted shares were granted under this plan.

In 1993, our Board of Directors approved a stock
incentive plan (the “Stock Plan”) designed to attract and retain directors,
officers and employees of the Company by enabling those individuals to
participate in the ownership of the Company. The Stock Plan authorized the
issuance in each calendar year of up to 3% of the total shares outstanding at
the end of such year. The Stock Plan provided for grants of up to 3,900,616
shares. The Stock Plan provided for the award (subject to ownership
limitations) of a broad variety of stock-based compensation alternatives such
as nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock and
performance awards.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company issued
217,774 shares, 189,732 shares and 221,144 shares of restricted stock,
respectively, which vest over periods ranging from five years to ten years.  The weighted average fair market values of
the restricted stock issued in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $19.98, $17.57 and
$14.95, respectively.

Stock options are granted with an exercise price
equal to the underlying stock’s fair market value at the date of grant. Stock
options expire ten years from the date they are granted and vest over service
periods of one, three, four and five years.

The following table summarizes our stock option
activity for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002:


At December 31, 2004, the options
outstanding under the Stock Plan had exercise prices ranging from $10.63 to
$14.70, with a weighted average price of $13.01, and expiration dates ranging
from June 2007 to December 2011 with a weighted average remaining
term of 4.1 years. At December 31, 2004, the options exercisable under the
Stock Plan had exercise prices ranging from $10.63 to $14.70 with a weighted
average price of $12.75.

The fair value of the stock option grant in 2002
was estimated at the date of grant using the binomial option-pricing model with
the following assumptions: expected dividend yield of 9.76%, risk-free interest
rate of 5.09%, volatility of 18.18% and expected life of options of 10 years.

16.

Stockholder Rights Plan

In 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”) that was to expire in July 2008.
The Rights Plan was canceled by the Board of Directors in February 2005.  The Rights Plan had assigned one right (a “Right”)
to purchase one one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of our Class A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, for each share of
common stock owned on or issued after July 1, 1998.  The Rights were not exercisable and did not
trade separately from our common stock.

Under specified circumstances, stockholders
would have been able to exercise their Rights if a person or group acquired 15%
of our common stock or made a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of our common
stock. In these circumstances, stockholders other than the acquirer would have
been able to exercise the Rights to purchase our common stock or, in some
situations, the acquirer’s stock at a 50% discount.

17.

Segment Information

We evaluate performance and make resource
allocation decisions on an industry by industry basis. For financial reporting
purposes, we have grouped our tenants into 31 industry and activity segments
(including properties owned by Crest Net that are grouped together). All of the
properties are incorporated into one of the applicable segments. Because almost
all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating expenses, revenue is the
only component of segment profit and loss we measure.

The following tables set forth certain
information regarding the properties owned by us, classified according to the
business of the respective tenants as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in
thousands):

(1) In accordance with SFAS 144 Crest Net’s
revenues appear in “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired
for resale by Crest.”


18.

Commitments and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of our business, we are
party to various legal actions which we believe are routine in nature and
incidental to the operation of our business. We believe that the outcome of the
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

At
December 31, 2004, we have committed to pay estimated unfunded development
costs of $13.0 million on properties under development.  We also have contingent payments for tenant
improvements and leasing costs of $1.0 million.

In
2004, we recorded impairment of $716,000 on one of our properties to reduce its
carrying value to zero.  This property is
classified as held for sale.  This
impairment was the result of a title insurance company failing to timely record
a deed on this property.  It is likely
that through our tenant’s bankruptcy proceedings, our title to this property
will be divested.  We believe that we
have a strong claim against the title insurance company and others for the loss
of the current fair market value of the property, rent which we may be required
to repay to the tenant, and direct and incidental costs incurred.  Our claim against the title insurance company
and others is estimated to be between $750,000 and $1.3 million, which is not
reflected in our consolidated financial statements as this represents a
contingent gain.

CONSOLIDATED
QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

(not covered by Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm)

(1)

The consolidated
quarterly financial data includes revenues and expenses from our continuing and
discontinued operations.  The results of
operations related to certain properties, that have been classified as held for
sale or have been disposed of, have been reclassified to income from
discontinued operations.  Therefore, some
of the information may not agree to our previously filed 10-Qs.

(2)

Amounts for
each period are calculated independently. 
The sum of the quarters may differ from the annual amount.

:

Changes In and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

We
have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accountancy or
financial disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent
fiscal years.

Item 9A

:

Controls
and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c)) that are
designed to ensure that

information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.

As
of and for the year ended December 31, 2004, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and

with
the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
includes those policies and procedures that:

(1) Pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(2) Provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company; and

(3) Provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.

Management has used the framework set forth in the
report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal
year.  KPMG LLP has issued an attestation
report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Controls.

There have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no material
weaknesses, and therefore no corrective actions were taken.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot
provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because
of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses
in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper
management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal
control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to
design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
