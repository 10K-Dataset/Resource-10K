PART I

Item 1:

Business

THE COMPANY

Realty Income
Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is a Maryland
corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, or
REIT.  Our primary business objective is
to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and
predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO per share.  The monthly distributions are supported by
the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and
national retail chains.  We have in-house
acquisition, leasing, legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio
management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 37 years, Realty Income
and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail
properties that generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements
(primarily 15- to 20-years).

In addition, we seek to
increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active
portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties. Our
portfolio management focus includes:

•

Contractual
rent increases on existing leases;

•

Rent
increases at the termination of existing leases when market conditions permit;
and

•

The
active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing of vacant
properties and selective sales of properties.

Our acquisition of
additional properties adheres to a focused strategy of primarily acquiring
properties that are:

•

Freestanding,
single-tenant, retail locations;

•

Leased
to regional and national retail chains; and

•

Leased
under long-term, net-lease agreements.

At December 31, 2005, we
owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,646 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.5%, or 1,621 properties occupied of the 1,646
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 101 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 13.4 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 8,200 square feet.

Of the 1,646 properties
in the portfolio, 1,641, or 99.7% are single-tenant, retail properties and the
remaining five are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At
December 31, 2005, 1,617, or 98.5%, of the 1,641 single-tenant were leased with
a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of
approximately 12.4 years.

In addition, our
wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., owned 17
properties with a total investment of $45.7 million at December 31, 2005,
which are classified as held for sale. 
Crest Net was created to buy, own and sell properties, primarily to
individual investors, many of whom are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the “Code.”

We typically acquire
retail store properties under long-term leases with retail chain store
operators. These transactions generally provide capital to owners of retail
real estate and retail chains for expansion or other corporate purposes. Our
acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in well-defined target
markets and generally focus on retailers providing goods and services that
satisfy basic consumer needs.

Our net-lease agreements
generally:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses (taxes,
insurance and maintenance); and


•

Provide
for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on increases in
the consumer price index, fixed increases, or to a lesser degree, additional
rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified
level.

Realty Income commenced
operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25 public and
private real estate limited partnerships with and into the Company. Each of the
partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and
managing long-term, net-leased properties.

The six senior officers
of Realty Income owned 1.3% of our outstanding common stock with a market value
of $25.1 million at February 10, 2006. The directors and six senior
officers of Realty Income, as a group, owned 2.7% of our outstanding common
stock with a market value of $51.6 million at February 10, 2006.

Realty Income’s common
stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol
“O.” Our central index key number is 726728 and cusip number is 756109-104.

Realty Income’s Class D
cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OprD” and its cusip number is 756109-609.

Realty Income’s 8.25%
Monthly Income Senior Notes, due 2008 are listed on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol “OUI.”  The cusip number of these
notes is 756109-203.

At February 10, 2006, we
had 69 permanent employees and four temporary employees as compared to February 15,
2005 when we had 64 permanent employees and six temporary employees.  The temporary employees have been working on
a record retention project that is expected to conclude during 2006.

We maintain an Internet
website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of
charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to those reports, as
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with
the SEC.  None of the information on our
website is deemed to be part of this report.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Credit
Facility

In June 2005, Realty
Income entered into a new $300 million acquisition credit facility to replace
our existing $250 million acquisition credit facility that expired in
October 2005. Under the terms of the new credit facility, which commenced in
October 2005, the borrowing rate was reduced to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered
Rate) plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points, for all-in
drawn pricing of 80 basis points over LIBOR, based on our current credit
ratings.  The new credit facility offers
us other interest rate options as well. The term of the new facility expires in
October 2008, unless extended as provided in the agreement.

Common
Stock Issuance

In September 2005, we
issued 4.1 million shares of common stock. 
The net proceeds of $92.7 million were used to fund new property
acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.

Credit
Ratings Upgrade

In September 2005, our
credit ratings were upgraded by Fitch Ratings. 
Our senior unsecured debt rating was raised to BBB+ from BBB and our
preferred stock rating was raised to BBB from BBB- with a stable outlook.

In February 2006, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. affirmed its ratings on our senior unsecured debt
rating of Baa2 and our preferred stock rating of Baa3 and raised the outlook to
“positive” from “stable.”

Issuance
of 12-Year Senior Unsecured Notes

In September 2005,
Realty Income issued $175 million in aggregate principal amount of 12-year, 5-


/


%
senior unsecured notes due 2017.  The
price to the public for the notes was 99.974% of the principal


amount for an effective
yield of 5.378%.  The net proceeds from
the offering were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s unsecured
acquisition credit facility, for property acquisitions and for other general
corporate purposes.  Our outstanding
notes and bonds are rated BBB+ by Fitch Ratings, Baa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group.

Issuance
of 30-Year Senior Unsecured Bonds

In March 2005, Realty
Income issued $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 30-year, 5-


/


%
senior unsecured bonds due 2035.  The
price to the investor for the bonds was 98.296% of the principal amount for an
effective yield of 5.998%.  The net
proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured
acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.

Acquisitions
During 2005

During 2005, Realty
Income and Crest Net invested in aggregate $486.6 million in 156 new properties
and properties under development. These 156 properties are located in 30 states
and are 100% leased with an initial average lease term of 15.8 years.  As described below, Realty Income acquired
135 properties and Crest Net acquired 21 properties.

Included in the $486.6
million is $430.7 million invested by Realty Income in 135 new properties and
properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease
rate of 8.4%. These 135 properties are located in 28 states, are 100% leased
with an initial average lease term of 15.6 years and will contain over 1.7 million
leasable square feet.  The 135 new
properties acquired by Realty Income are net-leased to 13 different retail
chains in the convenience store, drug store, financial services, health and
fitness, motor vehicle dealership, restaurant and theater industries.

Included in the $486.4
million is $55.9 million invested by Crest Net in 21 new retail properties and
properties under development.

Of the
$430.7 million Realty Income invested in real estate during 2005,
$43.9 million was invested in 10 properties that were leased and under contract
for development by the tenant at December 31, 2005 (with development costs
funded by Realty Income).  Rent on these
properties is scheduled to begin at various times during 2006.  At December 31, 2005, we also had
committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs totaling
$42.2 million.

The initial weighted
average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net
operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the base rent or,
in the case of properties under development, the estimated base rent under the
lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs.
Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual
rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will
remain at the percentages listed above.

Investments
in Existing Properties

In 2005, we capitalized
costs of $1.6 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of
$570,000 for re-leasing costs and $1.0 million for building improvements.

Net
Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders was $89.7 million in 2005 versus
$90.2 million in 2004, a decrease of $452,000. On a diluted per common
share basis, net income was $1.12 per share in 2005 as compared to $1.15 per
share in 2004.

The calculation to determine net income available to
common stockholders includes gains from the sale of investment properties. The
amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property
sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment
properties during 2005 was $6.6 million as compared to $12.7 million
during 2004.


Funds
from Operations (FFO)

In 2005, our FFO
increased by $11.4 million, or 9.6%, to $129.6 million versus
$118.2 million in 2004.  On a
diluted per common share basis, FFO was $1.62 in 2005 compared to $1.50 for
2004, an increase of $0.12, or 8.0%.

See our discussion of
FFO in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a
reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO.

Crest Net
Property Sales

During
2005, Crest Net sold 12 properties from its inventory for $23.5 million, which
resulted in a gain of $3.3 million.

Crest Net’s
Property Inventory

Crest
Net’s property inventory at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 totaled
$45.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively, and is included in “real
estate held for sale, net”, on our consolidated balance sheets.

Increases
in Monthly Cash Distributions to Common Stockholders

We continue our 36-year
policy of paying distributions monthly. 
Monthly distributions per share were increased in April 2005 by
$0.000625 to $0.110625, in July 2005 by $0.000625 to $0.11125, in September
2005 by $0.00375 to $0.115, in October 2005 by $0.000625 to $0.115625 and in
January 2006 by .000625 to $0.11625.  The
increase in January 2006 was our 33rd consecutive quarterly increase and the
37th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in
1994. In 2005, we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share:
three in the amount of $0.11, three in the amount of $0.110625, two in the
amount of $0.11125, one in the amount of $0.115, and three in the amount of
$0.115625 totaling $1.34625. In December 2005, January 2006 and February 2006,
we declared distributions of $0.11625 per share, which were paid on January 17,
2006, February 15, 2006 and will be paid on March 15, 2006, respectively.

The monthly distribution
of $0.11625 per share represents a current annualized distribution of
$1.395 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 6.1%
based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $22.78
on February 10, 2006. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying
monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current
level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing
distributions per share, or what the actual distribution yield will be in any
future period.

DISTRIBUTION POLICY

Distributions
are paid monthly to our common stockholders and Class D preferred stockholders
if, and when declared by our Board of Directors. The Class D preferred
stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7.375% per annum on
the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.84375 per annum per
share).

In
order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating
annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains) and we are
subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2005, our cash distributions
totaled $118.0 million, or approximately 113.2% of our estimated REIT
taxable income of $104.2 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income
reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. We intend to
continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet
this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income
taxes. Our 2005 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled
$108.6 million, representing 83.8% of our funds from operations available
to common stockholders of $129.6 million.

Future distributions
will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among
other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from operations,
financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, our debt service
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In
addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that


could limit the amount
of distributions payable by us in the event of a deterioration in our results
of operations or financial condition, and which prohibit the payment of
distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay
when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on
borrowings under our credit facility.

Distributions of our
current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes,
generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the
extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend or
that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced
rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified
dividend income” has generally been reduced to 15% (for taxable years beginning
after December 31, 2002). In general, dividends payable by REITs are not
eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends, except to the extent
the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable
corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net), to income that
was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we
distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable
year) or, as discussed above, dividends properly designated by us as “capital
gain dividends.” Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will
be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in the stock.
Distributions above that basis, generally, will be taxable as a capital gain.
Approximately 10.1% of the distributions, made or deemed to have been made in
2005, to our common stockholders were classified as a return of capital for
federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict the portion of future
distributions that may be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY

Investment
Philosophy

We believe that owning
an actively managed, diversified portfolio of retail properties under
long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income.  Under a net-lease agreement, the tenant
agrees to pay monthly rent and property operating expenses (taxes, maintenance
and insurance) plus, typically, future rent increases (generally subject to
ceilings) based on increases in the consumer price index, fixed increases, or
to a lesser degree, additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’
gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties
under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property
expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other
types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for
growth in rental income.

Investment
Strategy

In identifying new
properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing capital to
retail chain owners and operators by acquiring, then leasing back, retail store
locations. We categorize retail tenants as: 1) venture market,
2) middle market, and 3) upper market. Venture companies typically
offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate
between five and 50 retail locations. Middle market retail chains typically
have 50 to 500 retail locations, operations in more than one geographic region,
have been successful through one or more economic cycles, and have a proven,
replicable concept. The upper market retail chains typically consist of
companies with 500 or more locations, operating nationally, in a proven, mature
retail concept. Upper market retail chains generally have strong operating
histories and access to several sources of capital.

Realty Income primarily
focuses on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains that we
believe are attractive for investment because:

•

They
generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that
can adversely affect venture retailers;

•

They
typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing
options;

•

They
generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time
since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as their
businesses have matured;

•

Their
relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater
number of stores; and

•

Middle
market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number of
locations are closed due to underperformance.


We also focus on and
have selectively made investments in properties of upper market retail chains.
We believe upper market retail chains can be attractive for investment because:

•

They
typically are of a higher credit quality;

•

They
usually are larger public and private retailers with more commonly recognized
brand names;

•

They
utilize a larger building ranging in size from 10,000 to 50,000 square feet;
and

•

They
are able to grow because access to capital facilitates larger transaction
sizes.

While our investment
strategy focuses primarily on acquiring properties leased to middle and upper
market retail chains, we also selectively seek investment opportunities with
venture market retail chains. Periodically, venture market opportunities arise
where we feel that the real estate used by the tenant is high quality and can
be purchased at favorable prices. To meet our stringent investment standards,
however, venture retail companies must have a well-defined retailing concept
and strong financial prospects. These opportunities are examined on a case by
case basis and we are highly selective in making investments in this area.

Historically, our
investment focus has been on retail industries that have a service component because
we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable.
Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005,
approximately 81.2% of our rental revenue was derived from retailers with a
service component in their business. Furthermore, we believe these
service-oriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the Internet
and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from
Internet businesses.

Credit
Strategy

We
generally provide sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade retail
chains.  We typically acquire and lease
back properties to regional and national retail chains and believe that within
this market we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return on the financing
we provide to retailers.  Since 1970, our
overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 98.5%,
and the occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 97.5%.

We believe the principal
financial obligations of most retailers typically include their bank and other
debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations.
Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its
retail business, we believe the risk of default on a retailers’ lease
obligations is less than the retailers’ unsecured general obligations. It has
been our experience that since retailers must retain their profitable retail
locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization they are less likely
to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their
right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will fare
better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the event of
reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization,
we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the
property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real estate
leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the retailers’
individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are
weaker performers.

In order to qualify for
inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent
investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive
current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.  We have established a three-part analysis
that examines each potential investment based on:

•

Industry,
company, market conditions and credit profile;

•

Location
profitability, if profitability data is available; and

•

Overall
real estate characteristics, including value and comparative rental rates.

The typical profile of
companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50
or more retail locations.  Generally the
properties:

•

Are
located in highly visible areas,

•

Have
easy access to major thoroughfares; and

•

Have
attractive demographics.


Acquisition
Strategy

We seek to invest in
industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national chains are
capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale,
advertising and the selection of prime retail locations. We execute our
acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national
retail chain store owners and operators, doing business in a variety of
industries, by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations. We undertake
thorough research and analysis to identify appropriate industries, tenants and
property locations for investment. Our research expertise is instrumental to
uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing
program adds value. In selecting real estate for potential investment, we
generally seek to acquire properties that have the following characteristics:

•

Freestanding,
commercially-zoned property with a single tenant;

•

Properties
that are important retail locations for regional and national retail chains;

•

Properties
that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business
of their tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;
and

•

Properties
that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of
long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential
for rent increases.

Portfolio
Management Strategy

The active management of
the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We
continually monitor our portfolio for changes that could affect the performance
of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. The
portfolio is regularly analyzed with a view toward optimizing its returns and
enhancing its credit quality. Our executives review industry research, tenant
research, property due diligence and significant portfolio management
activities. This monitoring typically includes regular review and analysis of:

•

The
performance of various retail industries; and

•

The
operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the
tenants.

We have an active
portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we
believe the reinvestment of the sales proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio, or extend our average
remaining lease term. At December 31, 2005, we classified real estate with a
carrying amount of $47.1 million as held for sale, which includes
$45.5 million in properties owned by Crest Net.  In addition, $219,000 invested by Crest Net
in real estate is included in other assets and was classified as intangible
assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
141,

Business Combinations

.  Additionally, we anticipate selling
investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically
identified from which we anticipate receiving between $15 million and $35
million in proceeds during the next 12 months. 
We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions. However,
we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months.

Conservative
Capital Structure

We believe that our
stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we
seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid
interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February 10, 2006, our total
outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were
$886.6 million or approximately 30.3% of our total market capitalization of
$2.92 billion. We calculate our total market capitalization at February
10, 2006 as the sum of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 83,880,873 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $22.78 per share, or $1.91 billion;

•

Aggregate
liquidation value of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

•

Outstanding
borrowings of $131.6 million on our credit facility; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $755.0 million.

Historically, we have
met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock, preferred
stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe
that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of
common stock, however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that
our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to
be invested into additional properties on an accretive basis. In addition, we
may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by
our credit facility


or debt securities.
However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets
at terms that are acceptable to us.

We have a $300 million
revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2008. At February
10, 2006, the outstanding balance on the acquisition credit facility was
$131.6 million, with an effective interest rate of approximately 5.2%. A
commitment fee of 0.15% per annum accrues on the total $300 million credit
commitment of the credit facility. The credit facility has been, and is
expected to be, used to acquire additional retail properties leased to regional
and national retail chains under long-term, net-lease agreements. The credit
facility has also been used to provide capital to subsidiaries for the purpose
of funding the acquisition of properties. 
We regularly evaluate our credit facility and may seek to extend, renew
or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate.

We use our credit
facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. When
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility reach a certain level
(generally in the range of $100 million to $200 million) and capital is
available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings
with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include
the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible preferred stock,
debt securities or convertible debt securities. We cannot assure you, however,
that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing or that market conditions
prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt
securities upon acceptable terms.

We are currently
assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior unsecured
notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Group. Currently, Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+,
Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a
rating of BBB to our senior notes.  Moody’s
rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook.

We have also been
assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has
assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of
BBB- to our preferred stock.  Moody’s
rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook.

The credit ratings
assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of
operations and financial condition.

We have no mortgage debt
on any of our properties.

No
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

Realty Income and its
subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in “variable
interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading
activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments.

As we have no joint
ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatory redeemable preferred stock,
our financial position and results of operations are currently not affected by
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.

Competitive
Strategy

We believe that to
successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we must seek to
maintain the following competitive advantages:

•

Size and Type of Investment Properties:

We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000) net-leased
retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s
real estate environment. Due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a
large portfolio of relatively small assets, we believe these types of
properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest or
the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger income-producing
properties. We believe the less intensive day-to-day


property
management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management
of a large portfolio of smaller properties, is an effective investment
strategy. The tenants of our freestanding retail properties generally provide
goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and
expand, they generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is
typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these retailers,
our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a
net-lease arrangement, allows the retail chain to free up capital.

•

Investment in New Retail Industries:

Though we specialize in single-tenant
properties, we will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of
retail industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in retail
industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find
attractive. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, retail
industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and
national chain store operators can increase market share and dominance by
consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as
capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base.

•

Diversification:

Diversification of the portfolio by retail
industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of
providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore
further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December
31, 2005, our retail property portfolio consisted of 1,646 properties located
in 48 states, leased to 101 retail chains doing business in 29 industry
segments. Each of the 29 industry segments, represented in our property
portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 17.8% of our rental revenue
for the quarter ended December 31, 2005.

•

Management Specialization:

We believe that our management’s
specialization in single-tenant retail properties, operated under net-lease
agreements, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this
specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in
this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.

•

Technology:

We intend to stay at the forefront of
technology in our efforts to efficiently and economically carry out our
operations. We maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to
analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments. We
believe that technology and information-based systems will play an increasingly
important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of
capital to a variety of industries and tenants.

PROPERTIES

At December 31, 2005, we
owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,646 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.5%, or 1,621 properties occupied of the 1,646
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 101 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 13.4 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space of 8,200 square feet.

In addition to our real
estate portfolio at December 31, 2005, our subsidiary, Crest Net had invested
$45.7 million in a portfolio of 17 properties located in nine states.
These properties are classified as held for sale.

At December 31, 2005,
1,617, or 98.2%, of our 1,646 retail properties were owned under net-lease
agreements. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for
minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes,
insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically responsible for
future rent increases (generally subject to ceilings) based on increases in the
consumer price index, fixed increases or , to a lesser degree, additional rent
calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level.


Our net-leased retail
properties primarily are leased to regional and national retail chain store
operators. Most buildings are single-story structures with adequate parking on
site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods. The properties tend to be on
major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic counts and adequate access and
proximity to a sufficient population base constituting a suitable market or
trade area for the retailer’s business.

Description
of Leasing Structure

At December 31, 2005,
1,617 single tenant and certain other retail properties or 98.2% of our 1,646
properties were net leased. In most cases, the leases:

•

Are
for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

•

Require
the tenants to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses
(taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

•

Provide
for future rent increases (typically subject to ceilings) based on increases in
the consumer price index, fixed increases, or to a lesser degree, additional
rent based upon the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. Where leases
provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index,
generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent. Where
leases provide for percentage rent, this additional rent is typically payable
only if the tenants’ gross sales, for a given period (usually one year), exceed
a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the
amount of gross sales in excess of that level.

Matters
Pertaining to Certain Properties and Tenants

Of the 25 properties
available for lease or sale at December 31, 2005; all but one are single-tenant
properties.  At December 31, 2005, 17 of
our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the
tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations.  During 2005, each of our tenants accounted
for less than 10% of our rental revenue.

Certain
Properties Under Development

Of the 135 properties
Realty Income acquired in 2005, all were occupied at December 31, 2005,
except for 10 properties that were leased and being developed.  In the case of development properties, we
either enter into an agreement with a retail chain where the retailer retains a
contractor to construct the improvements and we fund the costs of that
development, or we fund a developer who constructs the improvements. In either
case, there is an executed lease with a retail tenant at the time of the land
purchase (with a fixed rent commencement date) and there is a requirement to
complete the construction in a timely basis and within a specific budget, typically
within eight months after we purchase the land. The tenant or developer
generally is required to pay construction cost overruns to the extent that they
exceed the construction budget by more than a predetermined amount. We also
enter into a lease with the tenant at the time we purchase the land, which
generally requires the tenant to begin paying base rent when the store opens
for business. The base rent is calculated by multiplying a predetermined capitalization
rate by our total investment in the property including the land cost for the
property, construction costs and capitalized interest. In 2005, Realty Income
acquired 21 development properties.  Crest
Net did not acquire any development property in 2005.  Both Realty Income and Crest Net will
continue to pursue development opportunities under similar arrangements in the
future.

Item 1A:

Risk
Factors

As used under this
caption “Risk Factors,” references to our capital stock include our common
stock and any class or series of our preferred stock and references to our
stockholders include holders of our common stock or any class or series of our
preferred stock, in each case unless otherwise expressly stated or the context
otherwise requires.

In order to grow w

e
need to continue to acquire investment properties which may be subject to
competitive pressures.

We face competition in
the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect competition from:

•

businesses;

•

individuals;

•

fiduciary
accounts and plans; and

•

other
entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some of these
competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This
competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.


Our
tenants’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent may be affected by
competition within their industries from other operators.

The tenants leasing our
properties can face significant competition from other operators.  This competition may adversely impact:

•

that
portion, if any, of the rental stream to be paid to us based on a tenant’s
revenues; and

•

the
tenants’ results of operations or financial condition.

As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown
environmental liabilities.

Investments in real
property can create a potential for environmental liability.  An owner of property can face liability for
environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous
substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of:

•

our
knowledge of the contamination;

•

the
timing of the contamination;

•

the
cause of the contamination; or

•

the
party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There
may be environmental problems of which we are unaware associated with our
properties. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators
of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators
of oil change and tune-up facilities. These facilities, and some other of our
properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground
tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create
a potential for release of hazardous substances.

The presence of
hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell
that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although our
leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all
applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising
from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject
to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no
assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification
obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities
attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distributions to
stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities
and other indebtedness.

In addition, several of
our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in
building construction and other facilities with asbestos may be acquired by the
Company in the future.  Environmental
laws govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing
materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings
containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they
adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and
that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement
in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a
building.  These laws may impose fines
and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these
requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or
operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

Compliance.

We have not been notified by any governmental
authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance,
liability or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or
petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties.
Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject
to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest.  In addition, we believe we are in compliance
in all material respects with all present federal, state and local laws
relating to ACMs.

Insurance and Indemnity.

In June 2005, we entered into a new
seven-year environmental insurance policy on our property portfolio which replaced
the previous five-year environmental insurance policy.  The limits on our
new policy are $10 million per occurrence, and $50 million in the
aggregate, subject to a $40,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for
properties with underground storage tanks and a $100,000 self insurance retention,
per occurrence, for all other properties.  It is possible that our
insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental
situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for
environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all.


Our tenants are generally
responsible for and indemnify us against liabilities for environmental matters
that occur on our properties.  For
properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an
indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or
rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located.

If
we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends
we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market
price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt
securities.

Commencing
with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been
organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to
qualify as a “REIT” under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we
cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that
has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will
continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue
to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification
as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly
technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited
judicial and administrative interpretations, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

For
example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in
each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay
distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT
taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).

In
the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such
qualification.

If
we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualifications as a REIT, we may
be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to
qualify as a REIT.  If we were to fail to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

•

we would be
required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

•

we would not
be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed
to our stockholders;

•

we could be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the
year during which qualification is lost;

•

we would no
longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

•

this
treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or
distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the
years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price
of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Even
if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we
have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a
100% tax. Our subsidiary Crest Net is subject to federal and state taxes at the
applicable tax rates on its income and property.

Distributions requirements imposed by law limit our
flexibility.

To
maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are
required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by
excluding net capital gains each year. We also are subject to tax at regular
corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.

In
addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we
fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our
ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net


income
for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed
in prior years.

We
intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the
distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to
federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing
between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable
income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could
require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution
requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with
qualifying as a REIT.

Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the
interest of holders of our common stock.

Our
future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional
capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity
securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The
interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of
shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to
stock incentive plans.  Likewise, our
Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any
class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by the
Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the
issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that
could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interests of holders of our
common stock.

We are
subject to risks associated with debt financing.

We intend to incur
additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $300
million acquisition credit facility.  At February
10, 2006, we had borrowings outstanding under our $300 million acquisition
credit facility of $131.6 million and we had a total of $755 million
outstanding in unsecured notes and bonds. To the extent that new indebtedness
is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would
increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt
financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet
required payments on our debt.  We also
face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our $300 million
credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time.  We also face the risk that we may be unable
to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. In addition, our $300 million
credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of
distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock in the
event of deterioration in our results of operations or financial
condition.  Our $300 million credit
facility also provides that in the event of a failure to pay principal or interest
on borrowings there under when due (subject to any applicable grace period), we
and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends on our capital stock, including
our outstanding common and preferred stock. If this were to occur, it would
likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and
preferred stock and on the value of our debt securities.

Our indebtedness could
also have other important consequences to holders of the common stock, such as:

•

increase our
vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limit our
ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•

require the use
of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and
interest on

,

our indebtedness thereby
reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures and general corporate requirements;

•

limit our
flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our
industry; and

•

place us at a
disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.

Our
business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on
our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our ability to make
distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our
indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our
ability to generate cash in the future.  There
can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred
stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.


The market value of our capital
stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.

The market value of our
capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change
from time to time, including, but not limited to:

•

interest rate
increases that may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital
stock and our debt securities;

•

the market for
other similar securities issued by other REITs;

•

general economic
and financial market conditions;

•

the financial
condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;

•

changes in
financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to
us, our competitors or our industry;

•

changes in our
credit ratings; and

•

actual or
anticipated variations in quarterly operating results.

As a result of these and
other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may
experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the market value of our capital
stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating
performance or prospects.

Real
Estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a
negative impact on our revenue.

We
are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real
estate.  In particular, we face the risk
that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all
corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur
and distributions on our stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:

•

adverse
changes in general or local economic conditions;

•

changes in
supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

•

changes in
interest rates and operating expenses;

•

competition
for tenants;

•

changes in
market rental rates;

•

inability to
lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

•

renewal of
leases at lower rental rates;

•

inability to
collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;

•

changes in
tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact
upon the value of real estate;

•

uninsured
property liability;

•

property
damage or casualty losses;

•

unexpected
expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance
with applicable federal, state and local laws;

•

acts of
terrorism and war; and

•

acts of God
and other factors beyond the control of our management.

An
uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could
subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under
the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties,
tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from
liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due
to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the
negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants
are generally required, at the tenant’s expense, to obtain and keep in full
force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance
policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for
property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement
cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily
excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain general
liability coverage varying between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000 depending on the
tenant and the industry in which it operates.

In
addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above,
many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance
policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by


the
tenants as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have
obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial
deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our
properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided
by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a
loss. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding
the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of
a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy,
we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue
from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay
the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and
to make distributions to our stockholders.

Compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990
and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended
expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operation.

Our
properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance
requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but
generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with
disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of
access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the
U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to
whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA
provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs
associated with compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures
than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis
than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be
adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply
with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our
results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the
principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to
make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we are required to operate
our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes
and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies
and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make
substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these
expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations or
financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our
debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our
stockholders.

Property taxes may increase without notice.

The
real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop
or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those
properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.

A downturn in our tenants’ industries could adversely impact
our business.

For 2005, our tenants in
the convenience store and child care industries accounted for approximately
18.7% and 12.7%, respectively, of our rental revenue.  Individually, each of the other industries in
our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for
the year 2005.  A downturn in any of
these industries, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the
United States, could adversely affect tenants in these industries, which in
turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of
operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt
securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock
and preferred stock.

In addition, a
substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market retail chains
that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain
upper-market retail chains, and therefore they are more likely to be adversely
affected by a downturn in their respective business or in the regional or
national economy.

We depend on key personnel.

We
depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of
the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our
ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other
indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.  It is possible that we will not be able to
recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the retail,
net-leasing industry.


Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may
affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we
operate and our results of operations.

Terrorist
attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment.  There can be no assurance that there will not
be further terrorist attacks against the United States or United States
businesses. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical
facilities or the businesses of our tenants.

Such
events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in
increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy.
They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or
abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our
operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and
on the value of our debt securities.  It
could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest
on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our
stockholders.

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges is
calculated by dividing earnings by fixed charges.  For this purpose, earnings consist of net
income before interest expense.  Fixed
charges are comprised of interest costs (including capitalized interest) and
the amortization of debt issuance costs.  In computing the ratio of earnings to combined
fixed charges and preferred stock cash dividends, preferred stock cash dividends
consist of dividends on our Class B preferred stock, Class C preferred stock
and our outstanding Class D preferred stock. 
We redeemed our Class B preferred stock in June 2004 and our Class C
preferred stock in July 2004, we issued 4,000,000 shares of our 7-3/8%
Class D preferred stock in May 2004 and we issued 1,100,000 shares of our
7-3/8% Class D preferred stock in October 2004.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

GENERAL

Realty Income
Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company

®

, is a Maryland
corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, or
REIT.  Our primary business objective is
to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and
predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO per share.  The monthly distributions are supported by
the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and
national retail chains.  We have in-house
acquisition, leasing, legal, retail and real estate research, portfolio
management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 37 years, Realty Income
and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail
properties that generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements
(primarily 15- to 20-years).

In addition, we seek to
increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active
portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties. At December
31, 2005, we owned a diversified portfolio:

•

Of
1,646 retail properties;

•

With
an occupancy rate of 98.5%, or 1,621 properties occupied of the 1,646
properties in the portfolio;

•

Leased
to 101 different retail chains doing business in 29 separate retail industries;

•

Located
in 48 states;

•

With
over 13.4 million square feet of leasable space; and

•

With
an average leasable retail space per property of 8,200 square feet.

Of the 1,646 properties
in the portfolio, 1,641, or 99.7%, are single-tenant, retail properties and the
remaining five are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At
December 31, 2005, 1,617, or 98.5%, of the 1,641 single-tenant properties were
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options)
of approximately 12.4 years.

In addition, our
wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., owned 17
properties with a total investment of $45.7 million at December 31, 2005,
which are classified as held for sale. 
Crest Net was created to buy, own and sell properties, primarily to
individual investors, many of whom are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
Reserves

Realty Income is
organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and
distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a
substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail
properties. We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working
capital. At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $65.7
million.

We believe that our cash
and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities and
borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the
foreseeable future.  We intend, however,
to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay
our credit facility.

$300 Million Credit Facility

We have a $300 million
revolving, unsecured credit facility that expires in October 2008. Realty
Income’s current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing under
the credit facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to
as LIBOR, plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points, for
all-in drawn pricing of 80 basis points over LIBOR.  At February 10, 2006, we had a borrowing
capacity of $168.4 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding
balance of $131.6 million at an effective interest rate of 5.2%.


The credit facility is
expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties and for other
corporate purposes.  Any additional
borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.

Mortgage
Debt

We have no mortgage debt
on any of our properties.

Universal
Shelf Registration of $800 Million

In February 2004, we
filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the
issuance, from time to time, of up to $800 million in aggregate value of common
stock, preferred stock and debt securities. 
At February 10, 2006, $227.9 million remained available for
issuance under our universal shelf registration statement.

Issuance
of Common Stock in 2005

In
September 2005, Realty Income issued 4.1 million shares of common stock.  The net proceeds of approximately $92.7 from
this offering were used to fund new property acquisitions and for other general
corporate purposes.

Issuance
of 12-Year Senior Unsecured Notes

In September 2005,
Realty Income issued $175 million in aggregate principal amount of 12-year, 5-


/


%
senior unsecured notes due 2017.  The
price to the public for the notes was 99.974% of the principal amount for an
effective yield of 5.378%.  The net proceeds
from the offering were used to repay borrowings under the Company’s unsecured
acquisition credit facility, for property acquisitions and for other general
corporate purposes.

Issuance
of 30-Year Senior Unsecured Bonds

In March 2005, Realty
Income issued $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 30-year, 5-


/


%
senior unsecured bonds due 2035.  The
price to the investor for the bonds was 98.296% of the principal amount for an
effective yield of 5.998%.  The net
proceeds from the offering were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured
acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.

Conservative
Capital Structure

We believe that our
stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we
seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid
interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At February 10, 2006, our total
outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were
$886.6 million or approximately 30.3% of our total market capitalization
of $2.92 billion. We calculate our total market capitalization at February
10, 2006 as the sum of:

•

Shares
of our common stock outstanding of 83,880,873 multiplied by the last reported
sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $22.78 per share, or
$1.91 billion;

•

Aggregate
liquidation value of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

•

Outstanding
borrowings of $131.6 million on our credit facility; and

•

Outstanding
notes of $755.0 million.

Historically, we have
met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock, preferred
stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe
that the majority of our future securities issuances should be in the form of
common stock, however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt
securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that
our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to
be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue
common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit
facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have
access to the capital markets at terms that are acceptable to us.

Credit
Agency Ratings

We are currently
assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings, on our senior unsecured
notes, from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Group. Currently, Fitch Ratings has


assigned a rating of
BBB+, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard & Poor’s has
assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. Moody’s rating has a “positive”
outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook.

We have also been
assigned investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our
preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB, Moody’s has
assigned a rating of Baa3 and Standard & Poor’s has assigned a rating of
BBB- to our preferred stock.  Moody’s
rating has a “positive” outlook and the other ratings have a “stable” outlook.

The credit ratings
assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of
operations and financial condition.

Notes
Outstanding

In September 2005, we
issued $175 million of 5-3/8%, 12-year, senior unsecured notes due 2017.  Interest on these notes is paid semiannually.

In March 2005, we issued
$100 million of 5-7/8%, 30-year, senior unsecured bonds due 2035.  Interest on these bonds is paid semiannually.

In November 2003, we
issued $150 million of 5-1/2%, 12-year, senior unsecured notes due 2015 (the “2015 Notes”).  Interest on the 2015 Notes is paid
semiannually.

In March 2003, we issued
$100 million of 5-3/8%, 10-year, senior unsecured notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”).  Interest on the 2013 Notes is paid
semiannually.

In January 1999, we
issued $20 million of 8% senior unsecured notes due 2009 (the “2009 Notes”).
Interest on the 2009 Notes is payable semiannually.

In October 1998, we
issued $100 million of 8-1/4% Monthly Income Senior Notes due 2008 (the “2008 Notes”).
Interest on the 2008 Notes is payable monthly. The 2008 Notes are unsecured.

In May 1997, we issued
$110 million of 7-3/4% senior unsecured notes due 2007 (the “2007 Notes”).
Interest on the 2007 Notes is payable semiannually.

All of these notes
contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any
debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%;
(ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our
secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation
on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to
be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total
unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We
have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were
issued.

The following is a
summary of the key financial covenants to our senior unsecured notes.  The actual amounts are as of December 31,
2005.

All of our outstanding
notes have fixed interest rates.  Our
credit facility interest rate is variable.


The following table
summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of December 31, 2005 (dollars
in millions):

Table of Obligations

(1)
The credit facility balance was $131.6 million as of February 10, 2006.

(2) Interest on credit facility and notes has
been calculated based on outstanding balances as of December 31, 2005
through their respective maturity dates.

(3) Other consists of $42.2 million of estimated
unfunded costs on properties under development and $456,000 of contingent
payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs.

Our credit facility and
note obligations are unsecured. 
Accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these
obligations.

Preferred
Stock Outstanding

In May and October 2004,
we issued an aggregate of 5.1 million shares of 7.375% Class D cumulative
redeemable preferred stock.  Beginning
May 27, 2009, shares of Class D preferred stock are redeemable at our option
for $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.  Dividends on shares of Class D preferred
are paid monthly in arrears.

No
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investment

Realty Income and its
subsidiaries have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in “variable
interest entities” or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading
activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative
instruments.

As we have no joint
ventures, off-balance sheet entities, or mandatory redeemable preferred stock,
our financial position or results of operations are currently not affected by
Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.

Acquisitions
During 2005

During 2005, Realty
Income and Crest Net invested in aggregate $486.6 million in 156 new properties
and properties under development. These 156 properties are located in 30 states
and are 100% leased with an initial average lease term of 15.8 years.  As described below, Realty Income acquired
135 properties and Crest Net acquired 21 properties.

Included in the $486.6
million is $430.7 million invested by Realty Income in 135 new properties and
properties under development with an initial weighted average contractual lease
rate of 8.4%. These 135 properties are located in 28 states, are 100% leased
with an initial average lease term of 15.6 years and will contain over 1.7 million
leasable square feet.  The 135 new
properties acquired by Realty Income are net-leased to 13 different retail
chains in the convenience store, drug store, financial services, health and
fitness, motor vehicle dealership, restaurant and theater industries. At
December 31, 2005, 10 new properties acquired during 2005 were leased and under
contract for development by the tenant (with development costs funded by Realty
Income) with rent scheduled to begin at various times during the next 12
months.

Included in the $486.6
million is $55.9 million invested by Crest Net in 21 new retail properties and
properties under development.


Of the
$430.7 million Realty Income invested in real estate during 2005,
$43.9 million was invested in properties under development with rent
scheduled to begin at various times during 2006.  At December 31, 2005, we also had committed
to pay estimated unfunded development costs totaling $42.2 million.

The initial weighted
average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net
operating income (in a net-leased property this is equal to the base rent or,
in the case of properties under development, the estimated base rent under the
lease) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total costs.
Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual
rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will
remain at the percentages listed above.

Investments
in Existing Properties

In 2005, we capitalized
costs of $1.6 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of
$570,000 for re-leasing costs and $1.0 million for building improvements.

Sales of
Investment Properties

During 2005, we sold 23
properties and sold a portion of land from two properties for an aggregate of
$23.4 million, which resulted in a gain on sales of
$6.6 million.  This gain is included
in discontinued operations, except for $18,000 that is included in other
revenue.  The 23 properties sold
consisted of one automotive service store, two automotive tire service
locations, seven child care facilities, two consumer electronics stores, one
convenience store, one motor vehicle dealership, one private education
facility, seven restaurants, and one property classified as “other.”  The net proceeds from the sale of these
properties were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility
and to invest in new properties.

Crest Net
Property Sales

During 2005, Crest Net,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, sold 12 properties from its inventory for
$23.5 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.3 million.

Crest Net’s
Property Inventory

Crest
Net’s property inventory totaled $45.7 million at December 31, 2005 as compared
to $10.1 million at December 31, 2004. 
Crest Net’s properties are included in “real estate held for sale, net”,
on our consolidated balance sheets.

The financial statements
of Crest Net are consolidated into Realty Income’s financial statements. All
material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Increases
in Monthly Cash Distributions to Common Stockholders

We continue our 36-year
policy of paying distributions monthly. 
Monthly distributions per share were increased in April 2005 by
$0.000625 to $0.110625, in July 2005 by $0.000625 to $0.11125, in September
2005 by $0.00375 to $0.115, in October 2005 by $0.000625 to $0.115625 and in
January 2006 by .000625 to $0.11625.  The
increase in January 2006 was our 33rd consecutive quarterly increase and the
37th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in
1994. In 2005, we paid the following monthly cash distributions per share:
three in the amount of $0.11, three in the amount of $0.110625, two in the
amount of $0.11125, one in the amount of $0.115, and three in the amount of
$0.115625 totaling $1.34625. In December 2005, January 2006 and February 2006,
we declared distributions of $0.11625 per share, which were paid on January 17,
2006 and February 15, 2006 and will be paid on March 15, 2006,
respectively.

The monthly distribution
of $0.11625 per share represents a current annualized distribution of
$1.395 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 6.1%
based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $22.78
on February 10, 2006. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying
monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the current
level of distributions that we will continue our pattern of increasing
distributions per share, or what the actual distribution yield will be in any
future period.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical
Accounting Policies

Our consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our consolidated financial statements
are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires
us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe
that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner in a
way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and
evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the
business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for
reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and
assumptions.

In order to prepare our
consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set
forth by GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical
accounting polices. One of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in
determining depreciation expense for our properties. Depreciation of buildings
and improvements is computed using the straight—line method over an estimated
useful life of 25 years. If we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life it
could have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that 25
years is an appropriate estimate of useful life. No depreciation has been
recorded on Crest Net’s properties because they are held for sale.

Another significant
judgment that must be made is, if and when the impairment losses should be
taken on our properties when events or change in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a provision
is made for impairment loss if estimated future operating cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds
(undiscounted) are less than the current book value. Impairment losses are
measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the
lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The
carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated
balance sheet. If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying
value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses, it
could have a material impact on our results of operations.

The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Rental
Revenue

Rental revenue was
$196.3 million for 2005 versus $172.7 million for 2004, an increase of
$23.6 million, or 13.7%. Rental revenue was $142.9 million in 2003. The
increase in rental revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributable
to:

•

The
135 retail properties acquired by Realty Income in 2005, which generated
$12.1 million in 2005;

•

The
172 retail properties acquired by Realty Income in 2004, which generated
$17.1 million in 2005 compared to $9.4 million in 2004, an increase of
$7.7 million;

•

Same
store rents generated on 1,269 properties during 2005 and 2004 increased by
$1.3 million, or 0.8%, to $158.1 million from $156.8 million.  These properties were leased during all of
both 2005 and 2004;

•

An
increase in straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of $1.5
million in  2005 as compared to 2004; and

•

An
increase of $807,000 relating to the aggregate of (i) development properties
acquired before 2004 that started paying rent in 2004, (ii) properties that
were vacant during part of 2005 or 2004 and (iii) lease termination
settlements.  These items in aggregate
totaled $5.2 million in 2005 and $4.4 million in 2004.

Realty Income acquired
135 retail properties in 2005, excluding Crest Net acquisitions, and as a
result, our 2005 operating results included less than a full year of rental
revenue from these properties. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that the contribution to rental revenue from
these 135 properties will increase in 2006, because there


will be a full year of
rent from these properties.

Our portfolio of retail
real estate, leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases,
continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the
payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders.  At December 31, 2005, our portfolio of 1,646
retail properties was 98.5% leased with 25 properties available for lease, one
of which is a multi-tenant property.

Of the 1,646 properties
in the portfolio at December 31, 2005, 1,641, or 99.7%, are single-tenant
properties and the remaining properties are multi-tenant, distribution and office
properties. Of the 1,641 single-tenant properties, 1,617, or 98.5 %, were net
leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend
a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 12.4 years at
December 31, 2005. Of our 1,617 leased single-tenant and certain other properties,
1,488, or 92.0%, were under leases that provide for increases in rents through:

•

Base rent
increases tied to a consumer price index with adjustment ceilings;

•

Fixed
increases;

•

To a lesser
degree, overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales; or

•

A
combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.

Percentage
rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $1.2 million in 2005, $1.3
million in 2004 and $1.1 million in 2003. Percentage rent in 2005 was less
than 1% of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1%
of rental revenue in 2006.

As of
February 10, 2006, transactions to lease or sell 6 of the 25 properties
available for lease at December 31, 2005 were underway or completed. We
anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months,
although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold
within this period. It has been our experience that approximately 1% to 3% of
our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, we cannot
assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed
these levels.

Interest
Expense

Interest expense was
$6.8 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 primarily due to higher average
outstanding balances. Interest expense was $26.4 million in 2003.  The following is a summary of the five
components of our interest expense (dollars in thousands):

Interest on outstanding
credit facilities and notes increased by $8.5 million in 2005 as compared to
2004 primarily due to higher average outstanding note balances in 2005.


At February 10, 2006 the
weighted average interest rate on our:

•

Credit
facility borrowings of $131.6 million was 5.2%;

•

Notes
payable of $755.0 million was 6.3%; and

•

Combined
outstanding credit facility and notes of $886.6 million was 6.1%.

Interest
Coverage Ratio

Our interest coverage
ratio for 2005 was 4.4 times, for 2004 was 5.0 times and for 2003 was 5.3
times.  Interest coverage ratio is
calculated as: the interest coverage amount (as calculated in the following
table) divided by interest expense, including interest recorded to discontinued
operations. We consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate
supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense
obligations. Our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from
the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be
limited. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any
GAAP liquidity measures.

The following is a
reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to our interest
coverage amount (dollars in thousands):

(1)

Crest Net activities.

(2)

The 2005 amount includes intangibles
recorded in connection with acquisitions of real estate acquired for resale.

(3)

Includes interest expense recorded to “income
from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio

Our fixed charge
coverage ratio for 2005 was 3.6 times, for 2004 was 3.9 times and for 2003 was
3.9 times. Fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner
as interest coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends are also
added to the denominator. We consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an
appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest
and preferred stock dividend payments. Our calculation of the fixed charge
coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies
and, therefore, comparability may be limited. This information should not be
considered as an alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures.


Interest coverage amount
divided by interest expense plus preferred stock dividends (dollars in
thousands):

(1) Excludes the Class
B and Class C preferred stock non-cash charge of $3,774 in 2004 for excess of
redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed.

(2) Includes interest expense recorded to “income
from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

Depreciation
and Amortization

Depreciation and
amortization was $46.4 million in 2005 versus $39.9 million in 2004 and
$32.2 million in 2003. The increases in depreciation and amortization in
2005 and 2004 are due to the acquisition of properties in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
which was partially offset by property sales in these years.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General and
administrative expenses increased by $2.3 million to $15.4 million in 2005 versus
$13.1 million in 2004.  General and
administrative expenses were $10.6 million in 2003.  In 2005, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of total revenue increased to 7.8% as compared to 7.6% in 2004
and 7.4% in 2003.  General and administrative
expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs of corporate insurance,
payroll, employee benefits, corporate governance and Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
compliance costs.

As our property
portfolio has grown and continues to grow, we have increased, and anticipate
that we will continue to increase, the level of our staffing. We expect general
and administrative expenses to moderately increase due to costs attributable to
payroll, staffing costs and corporate governance.

At February 10, 2006, we
had 69 permanent employees and four temporary employees as compared to February 15,
2005 when we had 64 permanent employees and six temporary employees.  The temporary employees have been working on
a record retention project that is expected to conclude in 2006.

Property
Expenses

Property expenses are
broken down into costs associated with non-net leased multi-tenant properties,
unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio expenses. Expenses
related to the multi-tenant and unleased single-tenant properties include, but
are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property
inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. General portfolio costs include,
but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections and title search
fees. At December 31, 2005, 25 properties were available for lease, as compared
to 32 at December 31, 2004 and 26 at December 31, 2003.

Property expenses were
$3.8 million in 2005, $3.1 million in 2004 and $2.4 million in 2003. The
$769,000 increase in property expenses in 2005 is primarily attributable to an
increase in costs associated with vacant properties and bad debt expense.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes were
$813,000 in 2005 as compared to $699,000 in 2004 and $501,000 in 2003.  These amounts are for city and state income
taxes paid by Realty Income.  The
increases in 2005 and 2004 are due to an increase in rental revenue causing
higher city and state income tax expense.

In addition, Crest Net
incurred state and federal income taxes of $943,000 in 2005 as compared to $3.5
million in 2004 and $2.2 million in 2003. 
The decrease in 2005 over the 2004 and 2003 amounts are due to lower
taxable income, primarily attributable to lower gain on sales of real estate
acquired for re-sale.  These amounts are
included in “income from discontinued operations from real estate acquired for
resale by Crest.”


Discontinued Operations

Crest Net acquires
properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as
investments and operating the properties. 
Consequently, we classify properties acquired by Crest Net as held for
sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them.  The operations of Crest Net’s properties are
classified as “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for
resale by Crest.”

The following is a
summary of Crest Net’s “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale” for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars
in thousands):

Realty Income’s
operations from four properties listed as held for sale at December 31, 2005,
plus properties sold in 2005, 2004 and 2003 have been classified as
discontinued operations.  The following
is a summary of our discontinued operations from real estate held for
investment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in
thousands):

The following is a
summary of our total discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands):


Gain on Sales
of Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest Net

(included in
discontinued operations)

In 2005 Crest Net sold
12 properties for $23.5 million, which resulted in a gain of $3.3 million.
In 2004, Crest Net sold 51 properties for $75.0 million, which resulted in a
gain of $10.3 million.  In 2003, Crest
Net sold 27 properties for $45.2 million, which resulted in a gain of
$6.2 million.  All gains on sales of
real estate acquired for resale are reported before income taxes.

At
December 31, 2005, Crest Net had $45.7 million invested in 17 properties, which
are held for sale. Our goal is for Crest Net to carry an average inventory of
approximately $20 to $25 million in real estate.  Crest Net generates an earnings spread on the
difference between the lease payments it receives on the properties held in
inventory and the cost of capital used to acquire properties.  It is our belief that at this level of
inventory, rental revenue will exceed the ongoing operating expenses of Crest
Net without any property sales.

Gain
on Sales of Investment Properties by Realty Income

(included
in discontinued operations)

In 2005, we sold 23
investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for
$23.4 million and recognized a gain on sales of $6.6 million. This gain is
included in discontinued operations, except for $18,000 that is included in
other revenue.  In 2004, we sold or
exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four
properties for a total of $35.4 million and recognized a gain of
$12.7 million.  This gain is
included in discontinued operations, except for $185,000 that is included in
other revenue.  In 2003, we sold or
exchanged 35 properties and exchanged three excess land parcels (from three
properties) for $23.1 million and recognized a gain of $7.2 million,
which is included in discontinued operations.

We have an active
portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we
believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns,
enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio or extend our average
remaining lease term. At December 31, 2005, we classified real estate with a
carrying amount of $47.1 million as held for sale, which includes $45.5 million
in properties owned by Crest Net.  In
addition, $219,000 invested by Crest Net in real estate is included in other
assets and was classified as intangible assets. 
Additionally, we anticipate selling investment properties from our
portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified from which we
anticipate receiving between $15 million and $35 million in proceeds during the
next 12 months.  We intend to invest
these proceeds into new property acquisitions. However, we cannot guarantee
that we will sell properties during the next 12 months.

Provisions
for Impairments

Provisions for
impairments of $186,000 were recorded in 2005 on four properties as compared to
$2.4 million in 2004 on six properties and $1.2 million on 11
properties in 2003.  These provisions are
included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate held for
investment”, except for $151,000 in 2005, which is included in property expenses.

Preferred
Stock Cash Dividends and Redemption Charge

We had preferred stock
cash dividends of $9.4 million in 2005 as compared to $9.5 million in 2004
and $9.7 million in 2003.

When we redeemed our
Class B preferred stock in June 2004 and our Class C preferred stock in July
2004, we incurred non-cash charges of $2.4 million and $1.4 million,
respectively, for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value.  These non-cash charges represent the Class B
and Class C preferred stock original issuance costs that were paid in 1999
and recorded as a reduction to net income available to common stockholders when
the shares were redeemed.  These non-cash
charges equated to $0.05 per common share in 2004.

Net
income available to common stockholders

Net income available to
common stockholders in 2005 decreased by $452,000 to $89.7 million as
compared to $90.2 million in 2004. Net income available to common stockholders
in 2003 was $76.7 million.


The calculation to determine net income available to
common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of
gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and
can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.

The gain recognized from the sales of investment
properties during 2005 was $6.6 million as compared to $12.7 million
during 2004 and $7.2 million in 2003. 
The gain recognized from the sale of properties acquired for re-sale
during 2005 was $3.3 million as compared to $10.3 million during 2004 and $6.2
million during 2003.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO)

AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

FFO for 2005 increased
by $11.4 million, or 9.6%, to $129.6 million as compared to $118.2 million
in 2004 and $103.4 million in 2003. The following is a reconciliation of net
income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most
comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measure) to FFO,
information regarding cash distributions paid and the diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding for 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands):

We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition, as net
income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of
real estate assets, reduced by gains on sales of investment property and
extraordinary items.

We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental
measure of a REIT’s operating performance as it is based on a net income
analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as
depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets
requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which
implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.
Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions,
presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for
depreciation, could be less informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the
REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used
as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit
facility.


Presentation of this information is intended to assist
the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although
it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO the same way, so
comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO is not
necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not
be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of Realty Income’s
performance. In addition, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to
reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as
a measure of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions or of our
ability to pay interest payments.

Other
Non-Cash Items and Capitalized Expenditures

The following
information includes non-cash items and capitalized expenditures on existing
properties in our portfolio. These items are not included in the adjustments to
net income available to common stockholders to arrive at FFO. Analysts and
investors often request this supplemental information.

(1)

The
settlements on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk
prevention strategy that was used by the Company in 1997 and 1998, which
correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities.  We have not employed this strategy since
1998.

(2)

Amortization
of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred
and capitalized when our notes were issued in May 1997, October 1998, January
1999, March 2003, November 2003, March 2005 and September 2005. These costs are
being amortized over the lives of these notes. No costs associated with our
credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have
been included.

(3)

A
negative amount indicates that our straight-line rent was greater than our
actual cash rent collected.  A positive
amount indicates that our straight-line rent was less than our actual cash rent
collected.

(4)

Represents
the Class B and Class C preferred s

tock non-cash charges for the excess of
redemption value over the carrying value.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Tenant leases generally
provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants’
sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index, and/or fixed increases.
We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent
increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in
rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the
rate of inflation.

Approximately 98.2%, or
1,617, of the 1,646 properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net
leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses. Net
leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to
inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our
tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue.

IMPACT OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the
FASB issued Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based Payments

.
Statement No. 123R requires companies to recognize in the income statement the
grant-date fair value of stock options and other


equity-based
compensation issued to employees. We adopted Statement No. 123R on January 1,
2006. The impact of adopting Statement No. 123R was not material to our
financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued Statement No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, an Amendment of APB No. 29

. Statement No. 153 amends
APB Opinion No. 29 and states that companies will no longer be permitted to use
the “similar productive assets” concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at
book value with no gain being recognized. 
An exchange must be accounted for at fair value if the exchange has
commercial substance and fair value is determinable.  We adopted Statement No. 153 on January 1,
2006.  The impact of adopting Statement
No. 153 was not material to our financial position or results of
operations.

In March 2005, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations,

an interpretation of Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.

Interpretation No. 47 requires companies to
recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform
asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the
amount can be reasonably estimated. We adopted Interpretation No. 47 in the
fourth quarter of 2005.  The impact of
adopting Interpretation No. 47 was not material to our financial position
or results of operations.

Item
7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk

We are exposed to
interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and
long-term notes used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate
investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management
objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives we
issue long-term notes, primarily at fixed rates, and may selectively enter into
derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate lock agreements,
interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a
related financial instrument. We were not a party to any derivative financial
instruments at December 31, 2005. We do not enter into any transactions for
speculative or trading purposes.

Our interest rate risk
is monitored using a variety of techniques. The following table presents by
year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average interest rates, fair
values as of December 31, 2005.  This
information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to
interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

Expected
Maturity Data

(1)

$110 million matures in May 2007.

(2)

$100 million matures in October 2008.

(3)

The credit facility expires in October
2008.  The credit facility balance as of
February 10, 2006 was $131.6 million.

(4)

$20 million matures in January 2009.

(5)

$100 million matures in March 2013, $150
million matures in November 2015, $175 million matures in September 2017 and
$100 million matures in March 2035.

(6)

We base the fair value of the fixed rate
debt at December 31, 2005 on the closing market price or indicative price per


each note. The fair value of
the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are
similar to those available in the market place at December 31, 2005.

The table incorporates
only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2005; it does not consider
those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our
ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations,
would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging
strategies at the time, and interest rates.

All of our outstanding
notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. 
Our credit facility interest rate is variable.  Based on our credit facility balance at
December 31, 2005, a 1% change in interest rates would change our interest
costs by $1.4 million per year.

of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty
Income Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Realty
Income Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying table of
contents. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement Schedule III as listed
in the accompanying table of contents. These consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Realty Income
Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Realty Income
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Realty Income
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated February 21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

,

that
Realty Income Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Realty Income Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of Realty Income Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that Realty Income Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Also, in our opinion, Realty Income Corporation maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements of Realty Income
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying and our report dated February 21, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

REALTY INCOME
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

1.

Organization and Operation

Realty Income
Corporation (“Realty Income,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) is organized as a
Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial retail real estate and have
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”).

At December 31, 2005, we
owned 1,646 properties in 48 states containing over 13.4 million leasable
square feet, plus an additional 17 properties owned by our wholly-owned taxable
REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. (“Crest Net”). Crest Net was created to
buy, own and sell properties, primarily to individual investors, many of whom
are involved in tax-deferred exchanges, under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“the Code”).

A 2-for-1 stock split was
declared in November 2004 and became effective after the market closed on
December 31, 2004.  Common
stockholders received an additional share of common stock for each share they
owned.  The increase in the number of
common shares outstanding and all per common share data has been adjusted for
the stock split.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
Procedures

Federal
Income Taxes

.  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under
the Code. We believe we have qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT. As a
REIT, we will be permitted to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders and,
generally, will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on such
income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, except for federal income taxes
of Crest Net, which totaled $760,000 in 2005, $2.8 million in 2004 and
$1.8 million in 2003.  These taxes
are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for
resale by Crest.”

Earnings and profits that
determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders differ from net
income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in the
estimated useful lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the
carrying value (basis) on the investments in properties for tax purposes, among
other things.

The following reconciles
our net income available to common stockholders to taxable income for 2005
(dollars in thousands) (unaudited):


Net
Income Per Common Share

.  Basic net income per common share is computed
by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per
common share is computed by dividing the amount of net income available to
common stockholders for the period by the number of common shares that would
have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all
potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.

The following is a
reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share
computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share
computation, for the years ended December 31:

In 2005, 2004 and 2003,
no stock options were anti-dilutive. In 2005, we had 305,476 nonvested shares from
share based compensation that were anti-dilutive.  No nonvested shares were anti-dilutive in
2004 or 2003.

Discontinued Operations

.  In accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“SFAS 144”)

, Realty
Income’s operations from four investment properties classified as held for sale
at December 31, 2005, plus properties sold in 2005, 2004 and 2003, were
reported as discontinued operations. 
Their respective results of operations were reclassified to “income from
discontinued operations, real estate held for investment.”  We classify properties as held for sale in
accordance with SFAS 144.  We do not
depreciate properties that are classified as held for sale.

Crest Net acquires
properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them for
investment and operating the properties. 
Consequently, we classify properties acquired by Crest Net as held for
sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them.  In accordance with SFAS 144, the operations
of Crest Net’s properties are classified as “income from discontinued operations,
real estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

No debt was assumed by
buyers of our investment properties or repaid as a result of our investment
property sales and we have elected not to allocate interest expense to
discontinued operations related to real estate held for investment.

In accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 87-24, we allocate interest expense related to
borrowings specifically attributable to Crest Net properties.  The interest expense amounts allocated to the
Crest Net properties are included in “income from discontinued operations, real
estate acquired for resale by Crest.”

The following is a
summary of Crest Net’s “income from discontinued operations, real estate
acquired for resale” for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
(dollars in thousands):


The following is a summary of Realty Income’s “income from discontinued
operations from real estate held for investment” for the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands):

The following is a
summary of our total income from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands):

Leases

.  All leases are accounted for as operating
leases. Under this method, lease payments that have fixed and determinable rent
increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any
rental revenue contingent upon a tenant’s sales is recognized only after the
tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in
the consumer price indexes are recognized only after the changes in the indexes
have occurred, and then applied according to the lease agreements.

Principles
of Consolidation

.  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest Net and other entities
for which we make operational and financial decisions (control), after
elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions.  All of Realty Income’s and Crest Net’s
subsidiaries are wholly-owned.

Cash
Equivalents

.  We consider all short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity
of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Gain
on Sales of Properties

.  We recognize gains on sales of properties in
accordance with Statement No. 66,

Accounting for Sales of
Real Estate.

Depreciation
and Amortization

.  Depreciation of buildings and improvements
are computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25
years.

Maintenance
and Repairs

.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. Replacements and betterments are capitalized.

Provisions
for Impairments

.  We review long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Generally, a provision is made for
impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less
than the current book value. Impairment loss is measured as the amount by which
the current book value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If a
property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value, less cost to sell.


Provisions for
impairment of $186,000 were recorded in 2005 on four retail properties, of
which two were sold during 2005.  These
properties were classified in the following industries: one in child care and
three in restaurant.

Provisions for impairment
of $2.4 million were recorded in 2004 on six retail properties, of which five
were sold during 2004.  These properties
were classified in the following industries: one in automotive service, one in
child care, two in consumer electronics, one in convenience store and one in
restaurant.

Provisions for
impairment of $1.2 million were recorded in 2003 on 11 retail properties, all
of which were sold during 2003.  These
properties were classified in the following industries: one in automotive
service, three in child care, one in consumer electronics, three in home
improvement and three in restaurant.

All of these provisions
for impairment are included in income from discontinued operations, real estate
held for investment on our consolidated statements of income, except for
$151,000 in 2005 which is included in property expenses.

Acquired In-place Leases

.  In accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations, (“SFAS
141”)

the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place
operating leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of
land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and
liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases,
the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships, based in each case on
their fair values.

The fair value of the
tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and
buildings/improvements) is determined by valuing the property as if it were
vacant, and the “as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land and
buildings/improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of
these assets.  Our determinations are
based on a real estate appraisal for each property, generated by an independent
appraisal firm, which considered estimates of carrying costs during the
expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to
execute similar leases.  In allocating
the fair value to identified intangibles for above-market or below-market
leases, an amount is recorded based on the present value of the difference
between (i) the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place
lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rate for the
corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining
non-cancelable term of the lease.

Capitalized above-market
lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining
non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease
values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining
non-cancelable terms of the respective leases and expected below market renewal
option periods.

The aggregate value of
other acquired intangible assets consists of the value of in-place leases and
tenant relationships.  These are measured
by the excess of the purchase price paid for a property, after adjusting for
above or below market lease value, less the estimated fair value of the
property “as if vacant,” determined as set forth above.  The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the
value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense
over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease
were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts
relating to that lease would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate.

Stock
Option Plan

.  Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, and starting
January 1, 2002 expensed costs for all stock option awards granted, modified,
or settled.  Stock option awards under
the plan vest over periods ranging from one to five years.


The following table
illustrates the effect on net income available to common stockholders and
earnings per share if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding
and unvested stock option awards in each period (dollars in thousands, except per
share amounts):

Goodwill

.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as
well as when events or circumstances occur indicating that our goodwill might
be impaired.  We did not record any new
goodwill or impairment on our existing goodwill during 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Use
of Estimates

.  The consolidated financial statements were
prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications

.  Certain of the 2004 and 2003 balances have
been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.

3.

Retail Properties Acquired

We acquire land,
buildings and improvements that are used by retail operators.

A.  During 2005, Realty Income and Crest Net in
aggregate invested $486.6 million in 156 new retail properties and properties
under development. These 156 properties are located in 30 states, will contain
over 1.9 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an average
initial lease term of 15.8 years.

Of the
$486.6 million invested, $95.1 million was used to acquire 34
properties with existing leases on the properties.  In accordance with SFAS 141, Realty
Income recorded $10.1 million and Crest Net recorded $1.8 million as the
value of in-place leases and Realty Income recorded $183,000 as the value of
above-market rents.  In addition, Realty
Income recorded $756,000 and Crest Net recorded $66,000 as the value of
below-market rents on these leases.  The
amounts recorded by Realty Income are included in “other assets” and “other
liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the lives
of the respective leases.  Due to
property sales, of the amounts recorded by Crest Net, only $219,000 of in-place
lease value is included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2005.  Crest Net does not amortize the
value of in-place leases because its properties are held for sale.

In comparison, during
2004, Realty Income and Crest Net in aggregate invested $215.3 million in 194
new retail properties and properties under development. These 194 properties
are located in 19 states, contain approximately 972,000 leasable square feet
and are 100% leased with an average initial lease term of 17.5 years.


B.  During 2005, Realty Income invested $430.7
million in 135 new retail properties and properties under development, with an
initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.4%. These 135 properties
are located in 28 states, will contain over 1.7 million leasable square feet
and are 100% leased with an average initial lease term of 15.6 years.

In comparison, during 2004,
Realty Income invested $193.8 million in 172 new retail properties and
properties under development, with an initial weighted average contractual
lease rate of 9.5%. These 172 properties are located in 18 states, contain over
913,000 leasable square feet and are 100% leased with an average initial lease
term of 17.5 years.

C.  During 2005, Crest Net invested $55.9 million
in 21 new retail properties and properties under development.

In comparison, during
2004, Crest Net invested $21.5 million in 22 new retail properties and
properties under development.

D.  Crest Net’s property inventory at December
31, 2005 consisted of 17 properties with a total investment of
$45.7 million and at December 31, 2004 consisted of eight properties with
a total investment of $10.1 million. 
These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheets in “real
estate held for sale, net”, except for $219,000 of intangible assets at
December 31, 2005 which are included in other assets.

4.

Credit Facility

In June 2005, Realty
Income entered into a new $300 million acquisition credit facility to replace
our existing $250 million acquisition credit facility that expired in October
2005. Under the terms of the new credit facility, which commenced in October
2005, the borrowing rate was reduced to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)
plus 65 basis points with a facility fee of 15 basis points, for all-in drawn
pricing of 80 basis points over LIBOR, based on our current credit
ratings.  The new credit facility offers
us other interest rate options as well. The term of the new facility expires in
October 2008, unless extended as provided in the agreement.

The average borrowing
rate on our credit facilities during 2005 was 4.3%, compared to 2.4% in 2004
and 2.2% in 2003. Our current credit facility is, and previous credit
facilities were, subject to various leverage and interest coverage ratio
limitations. The Company is and has been in compliance with these covenants.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003,
interest of $1.9 million, $531,000 and $697,000, respectively, was capitalized
with respect to properties under development.

Our credit facility is
unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for
this obligation.

5.

associated with the 2008 Notes. In settlement of the agreement, we made a
payment of $8.7 million in 1998. The payment on the agreement is being
amortized over 10 years (the life of the 2008 Notes) as a yield adjustment to
interest expense. After taking into effect the results of a treasury interest
rate lock agreement, the effective rate to us on the 2008 Notes is 9.12%.

interest expense. After taking into effect the results of a treasury interest
rate lock agreement, the effective interest rate to us on the 2007 Notes is
7.62%.  Interest on the 2007 Notes is
payable semiannually.

are unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for
these or any other obligations.

All of these notes
contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any
debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%;
(ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our
secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation
on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to
be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total
unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We
have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes were

8.

Operating Leases

A.

At
December 31, 2005, we owned 1,646 properties in 48 states, excluding 17
properties owned by Crest Net. Of these 1,646 properties, 1,641 are single-tenant
retail locations and the remainder are multi-tenant, distribution and office
locations. At December 31, 2005, 25 properties were vacant and available for
lease or sale.

Substantially all leases
are net leases where the tenant pays property taxes and assessments, maintains
the interior and exterior of the building and leased premises, and carries
insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire and extended
coverage.

Percentage rent for
2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, including amounts recorded to discontinued operations.

At December 31, 2005,
minimum future annual rents to be received on the operating leases are as
follows (dollars in thousands):


B.

Major
Tenants – No individual tenant’s rental revenue, including percentage rents,
represented more than 10% of our total revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003.

9.

Gain on Sales of Real Estate Acquired for Resale
by Crest Net

In 2005, Crest Net sold
12 properties for $23.5 million, which resulted in a gain of
$3.3 million.  As part of one sale
in 2005, Crest Net provided buyer financing in the form of a $1.3 million
promissory note.  This note was paid in
full in February 2006.  In 2004, Crest
Net sold 51 properties for $75.0 million, which resulted in a gain of
$10.3 million.  In 2003, Crest Net
sold 27 properties for $45.2 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.2
million.

10.

Gain on Sales of Investment Properties by Realty
Income

In 2005, we sold 23
investment properties and sold a portion of the land from two properties for
$23.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $6.6 million.  This gain is included in discontinued
operations, except for $18,000 that is included in other revenue.

In 2004, we sold or
exchanged 43 investment properties and sold a portion of the land from four
properties for $35.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $12.7 million. Of
this gain, $12.5 million is included in discontinued operations and
$185,000 is included in other revenue. Included in the 43 properties was one
property leased by one of our tenants that we exchanged for another property
owned by that tenant (see note 12E).

During 2003, we sold or
exchanged 35 investment properties and exchanged three excess land parcels
(from three properties) for $23.1 million, which resulted in a gain of
$7.2 million. This gain is included in discontinued operations. Included
in the 35 properties was one property leased by one of our tenants that we
exchanged for another property owned by that tenant (see note 12F).

11.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We believe that the
carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2005 and 2004 reasonably approximate the fair values for cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and all liabilities, due to their short-term
nature, except for the line of credit payable and notes payable. In making
these assessments, we used estimates. The fair value of the line of credit
payable approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those
available in the market place at December 31, 2005. The estimated fair value of
the notes payable at December 31, 2005 is $755.0 million and at
December 31, 2004 is $500.9 million, based upon the closing market price
per note or indicative price per each note at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Employee Benefit Plan

We have a 401(k) plan
covering substantially all of our employees. Under our 401(k) plan, employees
may elect to make contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 60% of their
compensation, subject to limits under the IRS Code. We match 50% of our
employee’s contributions, up to 3% of the employee’s compensation. Our
aggregate matching contributions each year have been immaterial to our results
of operations.

14.

Common Stock Incentive Plan

In 2003, our Board of
Directors adopted and our stockholders approved the 2003 Incentive Award Plan
of Realty Income Corporation to enable us to attract and retain the
services of directors, employees and consultants considered essential
to our long-term success by offering them an opportunity to own stock
in Realty Income and/or rights that will reflect our growth,
development and financial success.  The 2003 Incentive Award Plan of
Realty Income Corporation was amended and restated by our Board of Directors on
February 21, 2006.  Under the terms of
this plan, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject to
options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights and other
awards will be no more than 3,428,000 shares. The maximum number of shares,
which may be subject to options, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation
rights and other awards granted under the plan to any individual in
any calendar year may not exceed 1,600,000 shares. This plan has a term of
10 years from the date it was adopted by our Board of Directors, which was March
12, 2003.

In 1993, our Board of
Directors approved a stock incentive plan (the “Stock Plan”), which expired in
2004.

Stock options are
granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock’s fair market
value at the date of grant. Stock options expire ten years from the date they
are granted and vest over service periods of one, three, four and five
years.  No stock options were granted in
2005, 2004 or 2003.


The following table
summarizes our stock option activity for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003:

At December 31, 2005,
the options outstanding under the Stock Plan had exercise prices ranging from
$10.63 to $14.70, with a weighted average price of $13.02, and expiration dates
ranging from June 2007 to December 2011 with a weighted average remaining term
of 3.3 years. At December 31, 2005, the options exercisable under the Stock
Plan had exercise prices ranging from $10.63 to $14.70 with a weighted average
price of $12.87.  Cash received from the
exercise of options is included in deferred stock compensation on our
consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

The following table
summarizes our nonvested common stock grant activity for the years 2005, 2004
and 2003.  The grants vest over periods
ranging from five to 10 years.

15.

Stockholder Rights Plan

In 1998, our Board of
Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”) that was to
expire in July 2008. The Rights Plan was canceled by the Board of Directors in
February 2005.

16.

Segment
Information

We evaluate performance
and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by industry basis. For
financial reporting purposes, we have grouped our tenants into 30 industry and
activity segments (including properties owned by Crest Net that are grouped
together). All of the properties are incorporated into one of the applicable
segments. Because almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating
expenses, revenue is the only


component of segment
profit and loss we measure.

The following tables set
forth certain information regarding the properties owned by us, classified
according to the business of the respective tenants as of December 31, 2005
(dollars in thousands):


17.

Commitments and Contingencies

In the ordinary course
of our business, we are party to various legal actions which we believe are
routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. We believe
that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
upon our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

At December 31, 2005, we
have committed to pay estimated unfunded development costs of
$42.2 million on properties under development.  We also have contingent payments for tenant
improvements and leasing costs of $456,000.

In 2004, we recorded
impairment of $716,000 on one property to reduce its carrying value to
zero.  This property is classified as
held for sale.  This impairment was the
result of a title insurance company failing to timely record a deed on this
property.  It is likely that through our
tenant’s bankruptcy proceedings, our title to this property will be
divested.  We believe that we have a
strong claim against the title insurance company and others for the loss of the
current fair market value of the property, rent which we may be required to
repay to the tenant, and direct and incidental costs incurred.  Our claim against the title insurance company
and others is estimated to be between $750,000 and $1.3 million, which is not
reflected in our consolidated financial statements as this represents a
contingent gain.

Item 9:

Changes
In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

We have had no
disagreements with our independent auditors on accountancy or financial
disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal
years.

Item 9A:

Controls
and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Securities Exchange Act 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c)) that are
designed to ensure that

information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.

As of and for the year
ended December 31, 2005, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
includes those policies and procedures that:

(1)
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(2)
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and

(3)
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting for the Company.

Management has used the
framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of
the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the
most recent fiscal year.  KPMG LLP has
issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Submitted on February 21,
2006 by,

Thomas A Lewis, Chief
Executive Officer and Vice Chairman

Paul M. Meurer, Chief
Financial Office, Executive Vice President and Treasurer


Changes in Internal Controls.

There have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. There were no material
weaknesses, and therefore no corrective actions were taken.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and
compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from
human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be
circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such
limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial
reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process
safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
