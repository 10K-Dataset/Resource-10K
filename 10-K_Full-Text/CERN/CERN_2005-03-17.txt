Cerner is taking the paper chart out of healthcare, eliminating error, variance and unnecessary
waste in the care process. With more than 1,500 clients worldwide, Cerner is a leading supplier of
healthcare information technology.

Cerner®

solutions give end users secure access to clinical,
administrative and financial data in real time. Consumers retrieve appropriate care information and
educational resources via the Internet.

Cerner implements these solutions as stand-alone, combined or enterprise-wide systems.

Cerner

solutions can be managed by the Company’s clients or via an application outsourcing/hosting model.
Cerner provides hosted solutions from its data center in Lee’s Summit, Missouri.

Cerner

solutions are designed and developed using the

Cerner Millennium

®

architecture.
The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is a state-of-the-art technology infrastructure that combines
clinical, financial and management information solutions. It provides access to an individual’s
electronic medical record at the point of care and organizes information for the specific needs of
the physician, nurse, laboratory technician, pharmacist or other care provider, as well as for
front and back office professionals.

Healthcare organizations utilize data gathered and stored within the

Cerner Millennium

architecture
to improve the safety, efficiency and productivity of the entire enterprise. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is designed to deliver medical knowledge and content to the point of care to help
clinicians predict outcomes of treatment plans and deliver the most effective care.

The Healthcare Industry

During 2004, stories of medical errors grabbed the nation’s attention, and the cost of healthcare
services continued to rise. As a result, several trends accelerated, including measures to increase
quality through pay-for-performance initiatives and a movement toward consumer- and employer-driven
care.

Healthcare Lags Other Industries in Technology Adoption

The healthcare industry continues to lag other markets in its adoption of technology to streamline
processes, increase safety and create cost efficiencies. For example, the finance industry spends
8.6 percent of operating budget on technology while healthcare spends only 3 percent, according to
the

Information Week

500 study conducted in 2004. The need for increased use of technology in the
delivery of healthcare appears to be reaching critical mass.

In the first half of 2004, healthcare costs rose 7.5 percent, according to the Center for Studying
Health System Change (HSC) and the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). This number is high
when compared to the 5.9 percent increase in per capita gross domestic product. Additionally, the
cost of hospital operations increased 8 percent in 2004, representing the largest one-year jump in
more than 10 years.

As consumers and healthcare organizations struggle to contain costs, many entities are driving
incentives for healthcare organizations to increase care quality. Pay-for-performance efforts, for
example, seek to align quality improvement with financial incentives rather than volume. To date,
more than 100 plans exist, and many of them are moving toward structured measures, which include
the use of healthcare information technology (HIT) and better outcomes, including both clinical and
patient satisfaction. For



example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is testing financial incentives to
reward hospitals that demonstrate high quality performance with its Premier Hospital Quality
Incentive, which rewards organizations in acute care. For ambulatory settings, CMS’ Doctors’ Office
Quality (DOQ) project develops and tests a comprehensive, integrated approach to measuring the
quality of care for chronic disease and preventive services. These efforts are intended to address
rapidly increasing healthcare costs and quality of care issues by promoting a best practices
approach and stimulating quality improvement and cost savings.

Consumer- and Employer-Driven Healthcare Become More Prevalent

While healthcare spending in the U.S. has held steady over the past two years, insurance costs
continue to increase at a double-digit pace, forcing many employers to either shift the costs to
employees or drop coverage altogether. According to the California-based Kaiser Family Foundation,
in 2003, the number of employees covered by employer-sponsored health insurance dropped to 45
percent, down from 53 percent in 1999. Additionally, there are now 45 million uninsured Americans,
an increase of 3.2 percent since 2002. From 2000 to 2004, the average family health insurance
premium increased 59 percent.

Unfortunately, experts predict that insurance costs will continue to rise. In a

USA Today

article,
UBS Analyst William McKeever predicted an insurance premium increase between 9 percent and 10
percent for 2005. As a result, employers and consumers are looking to minimize expenses, and an
estimated 50 percent of employers have moved to consumer-driven health plans. These plans give
consumers greater control and financial responsibility as they select the most cost effective
services and prescriptions. Forrester Research predicts that the consumer-driven health plan
membership will triple by 2005, making it the fastest-growing health plan sector.

In addition to consumers, many employers are also taking action to control costs and increase
quality. Through employer-driven health plans, companies encourage employees to utilize hospitals
that meet specific quality criteria. As an example, The Boeing Company established a plan in 2002
to encourage its employees to access hospitals that meet criteria developed by The Leapfrog Group,
a coalition of 160 companies working to improve the safety, quality and affordability of
healthcare. Hospitals are evaluated on their ability to meet these quality standards, such as the
use of computerized physician order entry (CPOE), and certain union groups are encouraged to use
the identified organizations over other hospitals. If the participating hospital meets national
patient safety standards for specific procedures, the hospital stay is eligible for a benefit
incentive payment of 100 percent. Those who select another facility pay 5 percent of their hospital
bill, which can often equate to hundreds or thousands of dollars.

These quality initiatives place pressure on hospitals to invest in information technology to remain
competitive, and Cerner’s technology is taking part in leading the way with respect to HIT
solutions.

Patient Safety Remains in Forefront of National Agenda

The year 2004 marked the fifth anniversary of a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) that
cited an unacceptably high rate of medical errors that resulted in an estimated 44,000 to 98,000
deaths per year in the United States. This report became a catalyst for improvement in healthcare
as experts cited the numerous flaws associated with a paper-based system. While the report exposed
the high rate of error, the progress made since its publication is unknown. This is due in large
part to fragmented efforts to report medical errors.

Only with a cohesive, comprehensive strategy can patient safety goals be achieved. Cerner’s proven
CPOE solution, with 65 acute care and 313 ambulatory live sites, can provide organizations with the
clinical functionality and executable knowledge to minimize errors and improve compliance with
standards at the point of care.

2004 may well be recognized as the year that the electronic medical record (EMR) entered the
national political agenda. Starting in January with the State of the Union address, President Bush
called for increased use of computerized health records to reduce costs, improve care and lower the
risk of error. He also established a goal of having an EMR for most Americans within 10 years.



Momentum continued to build in April when the Health Level Seven (HL7) organization announced the
passing of its ballot that created a model and accompanying standards for electronic health
records. This initiative will aid the adoption of the technology by creating a common platform for
their use.

In May, President Bush confirmed his commitment to HIT with the appointment of Dr. David Brailer as
the first national health infrastructure technology coordinator. In his position, Dr. Brailer is
tasked with bringing together the fragmented segments of healthcare to improve quality and reduce
costs.

In July, Neal Patterson, Cerner chairman and CEO, participated in the second annual National Health
Information Infrastructure (NHII) Summit in Washington, D.C., during which industry leaders
discussed plans to transform the delivery of healthcare by building new health information
infrastructure, including electronic health records and a nationwide network to link health
records. While there, Patterson suggested a similar urgency as President Bush’s 10-year call for
EMRs stating, “We are the generation that has to do this work.”

As the year came to a close, Dr. Brailer and Dr. Mark McClellan, administrator of CMS, spoke at
Cerner’s Health Care Leadership Forum and Cerner Health
Conference, both held in October. They
both talked about the growing momentum around HIT and the important role the marketplace can play
in hastening its adoption. 2005 promises to bring additional and important developments. Cerner
plans to play a role in shaping them.

The Cerner Vision

Cerner’s vision has evolved from a fundamental thought: Healthcare should not be organized around
an encounter; it should revolve around the individual. This concept led to Cerner’s Community
Health Model and the creation of the person-centric

Cerner Millennium

architecture – a truly
unified, enterprise-wide architecture. The Community Health Model encompasses four steps:

•

Automate the Core Processes

•

Connect the Person

•

Structure the Knowledge

•

Close the Loop

Automate the Core Processes

As long as medical information is isolated in a paper record, the inadequacies of today’s
healthcare delivery system will likely remain. Nurses and pharmacists will be forced to interpret
potentially illegible and incomplete orders. Physicians will not benefit from the real-time,
contextual reference information available in automated solutions. And clinicians throughout a
healthcare organization will continue to search for the single copy of the paper-based record; when
it is not readily available, they may be forced to make critical care decisions without adequate
information.

The elimination of the paper record can improve quality and safety, increase productivity, and
generate better documentation from which clinical outcomes, financial performance and resource
utilization can be benchmarked and analyzed.

With an EMR, clinicians view demographic information, medical history, lab results, vital signs and
treatment plans, along with notes from healthcare team members. Guidelines and pathways relevant to
the person’s medical condition help the physician make the best possible decisions in diagnosing
and treating the patient. This comprehensive view of the person’s health helps ensure safer and
higher-quality care.

Once all the steps of healthcare are captured electronically, the enhanced documentation will
create the foundation for data collection that can become the backbone for structuring the
knowledge of healthcare.

In addition to automating workflow, technology is essential in order to eliminate error, variance,
waste, delay and friction – all of which contribute to declines in healthcare quality and increases
in medical error. HIT can eliminate these factors, leading to an overall cost reduction in
healthcare.



Connect the Person

Cerner is dedicated to helping build a new medium between the person and the physician, which
empowers the individual and delivers higher-quality healthcare. A cultural shift toward
self-directed care is breeding a new consumerism in healthcare. With a personal health record,
individuals can store and access their medical information securely from anywhere they have
Internet access. When combined with personalized health content, consumers gain a better sense of
the care they are receiving and the options available to them. They communicate better with
providers and more proactively manage their healthcare.

Structure the Knowledge

Cerner is dedicated to building information systems that treat every clinical decision as a
learning event.

Cerner

solutions enable the industry to structure, store and study the application
and outcomes of medical practice.

Cerner believes medicine must have a structure that allows physicians to record treatment and
outcomes in such a way that it can be compared and contrasted with other methods. A common
nomenclature that can exactly capture the meaning of input from physicians and clinicians is a
necessary first step.

Cerner

solutions store healthcare data and provide a framework for comparability. This structured
data enables physicians to make sense of and glean value from the information that is gathered
through automated processes and connected persons. Cerner believes that without a knowledge
framework, data collected will provide no real benefit. By building this structure, Cerner opens
the door for every encounter with a patient and every piece of new knowledge to be catalogued,
measured and analyzed. This knowledge framework will allow providers to deliver better care and
develop an improved understanding of medicine.

Close the Loop

Cerner is dedicated to building information systems that deliver evidence-based medicine,
dramatically reducing the average time from the discovery of an improved method to the change in
medical practice.

Advances in technology offer great opportunities in healthcare and must be used to deliver better
care faster. The information learned must be applied. Today, patients may wait as long as 10 years
before new medical knowledge reaches widespread use. With systems designed to embed evidence-based
medicine inside the clinician’s workflow

¾

using pathways, guidelines and
alerts

¾

physicians know that the best science can be leveraged in every medical decision. This
leads to reduced variance and better outcomes.

Evolution of Community Health Model Connects Larger Communities

Over the next 25 years, medicine will become increasingly personalized and technology will become
more accessible. Cerner has created four business areas to address this evolutionary progress.
These segments, referred to by the Company as grid services, represent the utility-like potential of
the services Cerner will offer to large communities of users. The underlying principles of this
initiative are to:

•

Connect all stakeholders in the healthcare system;

•

Create a secure, transparent and open network for data
sharing; and

•

Remove the clinical, financial and administrative friction.

The first grid is the physician and metro grid, which focuses on leveraging Cerner’s physician
practice organization and on delivering a broad range of financial and clinical solutions to
physician offices. The other grids are the state and regional grid, which drives the Company’s
State and Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) strategy and its next version of
e-prescribing; the condition and disease management grid, which securely connects individuals with
chronic conditions, such as diabetes and asthma, with their healthcare providers; and the
transactional services grid, which seeks to eliminate friction in the healthcare system by
supporting the processing and management of healthcare transactions.



The Cerner Strategy

Key elements of the Company’s business strategy include:

Penetrate the integrated healthcare provider market.

Large healthcare systems represent a
significant component of the healthcare information technology market. These organizations focus on
improving safety and reducing costs through operating efficiencies. Cerner’s enterprise-wide,
person-centric clinical and management solutions provide the technology to manage healthcare across
an organization, significantly reducing costs, improving the efficiency of delivery and enhancing
the quality of care.

Increase market share in individual domains and further penetrate the existing client base by
cross-selling additional Cerner solutions.

Cerner expects continued growth in clinical domain
systems for specific markets such as nursing, physician office, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology,
surgery, emergency medicine and cardiology, as institutions look to restructure and reengineer
these high-cost centers.

Focus on independent physician practices.

As healthcare becomes increasingly personalized, access
to personal patient information is critical for both large integrated networks and independent
physician practices. As such, Cerner will concentrate significant efforts to reaching physician
practices of all sizes to systematize the healthcare process.

As part of these efforts, in January 2005, Cerner acquired the medical division of VitalWorks,
Inc., a leader in the private physician office information technology market. This transaction
expands Cerner’s presence in the physician practice market, an area which is expected to increase
considerably as the federal government continues its push to bring medical information to the point
of care. This acquisition, which adds 3,500 physician practices, builds on Cerner’s already
substantial hospital-affiliated physician client base, giving it additional reach across the entire
spectrum of the $4 billion ambulatory market.

Create the perfect client experience.

As a client-focused company, Cerner recognizes that
relationships are as critical to success as breadth and depth of solutions. As a result, its
approach to client services is broad, encompassing everything from implementation and adoption to
ongoing service and support. Once these elements are in place, healthcare organizations can realize
the full benefits of HIT and achieve their goals of higher quality care and patient safety.

HIT purchasing decisions are expensive and often present a great risk to both the sponsoring
organization and the ultimate decision-maker. Cerner is easing this process by creating a
comprehensive approach to implementation and management of these complex systems. The Company is
automating processes by creating a specific methodology designed to reduce the
design/build/maintenance efforts by up to 50 percent. This effort is intended to significantly
reduce implementation time and to lower the Company’s clients’ cost of ownership of

Cerner

solutions. The Cerner strategy also calls for easier system management, which will contribute to
Cerner’s ability to achieve its goal of guaranteeing an industry-leading application availability
rate.

Remain committed to a common architecture.

Because Cerner believes that the constituents in health
management need to work together to benefit defined populations in a community, the Company has
made a commitment to a single, unified architecture as the platform for its health information and
management systems. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is scalable on a linear basis, using either

Cerner

compatible modules for process-oriented applications or competitive systems interfaced using
open system protocols.

Develop innovative solutions and services.

Building upon the

Cerner Millennium

architecture, Cerner
intends to continue to lead the industry through new innovations. These solutions and services will
complement existing solutions, address clients’ emerging HIT needs and employ technological
advances.

In 2004, Cerner introduced

PathNet Helix

™, a breakthrough genomics solution for the laboratory.
This first-of-its-kind solution allows genetic information to be stored in an electronic medical
record, providing



immediate access to information from genetic tests and helping clinicians plan the most effective
therapy and treatment.

Additionally, the Company launched

INet

®

Virtual

, a cutting-edge solution for critical
care units to achieve real-time data sharing across all domains of care, thus eliminating the
communication barriers between care providers. The solution went live in November at the Borgess
Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan, a member of Ascension Health, the largest nonprofit health
care system in the United States. This implementation, which will form the foundation for the
national design for Ascension Health, was the first

INet Virtual

conversion for Cerner.

Cerner is committed to offering solutions that improve critical care quality, processes, safety and
outcomes. Its vision is for a single critical care quality improvement solution that incorporates
all standards and evidence. In February 2004, Cerner acquired

Project IMPACT

TM

, a
prominent solution in critical care performance benchmarking. This solution provides a unique
complement to the Cerner critical care suite of solutions by marrying

Project IMPACT

with the
decision-support and risk-adjustment capabilities of

APACHE

®

.

Additionally, the

PowerInsight

®

data-warehouse solution for healthcare business
intelligence helps to transform healthcare by providing a foundation for the accurate measurement
of a healthcare organization’s current business, delivering specific information and services
required for continuous performance improvement.

Continue pursuit of excellence in implementations.

Since the introduction of the

Cerner Millennium

architecture, Cerner has steadily decreased implementation timelines while increasing the number of
solutions converted within those timelines. In 2004, Cerner turned on 1,079

Cerner Millennium

applications, a 22 percent increase over 2003. This brings the total number of live applications to
3,767 at nearly 750 facilities.

Cerner’s prescribed practices implementation model, developed from more than 25 years of success in
developing and implementing HIT solutions, is contributing to the record number of implementations.
Comprised of a dedicated group of information technology consultants who specialize in

Cerner
Millennium

implementations and work closely with clients, the team takes much of the implementation
burden of database design and build activities away from the client. As a result, clients enjoy
reduced time, cost and complexity of implementation.

Expand Managed Services.

In addition to offering access to talent and economies of scale, there are
some services that, in certain circumstances, the Company can perform better and more economically
than its clients. Over the past several years, Cerner has added and offered a number of services,
called Managed Services. This set of technical services includes remote hosting, application
management and disaster recovery.

Build a reputation as a partner characterized by trust and integrity.

In an era in which corporate
financial scandals seem almost a constant in the headlines, Cerner pledges to promote trust and
integrity in every client relationship it establishes. Cerner’s three original founders – still in
leadership positions at the Company today – along with its long history of solid financial
performance are testaments to the Company’s commitment.

Continue to expand global presence

. Cerner has an immense opportunity to revolutionize the practice
and delivery of healthcare throughout the world through its leadership in clinical systems and
patient safety. To that end, Cerner continues to make significant investments in the infrastructure
development to support these efforts.

Cerner signed a contract with St. James’s Hospital in 2004, an organization that has emerged as the
largest acute general hospital in the Republic of Ireland. Cerner is providing an integrated
RIS/PACS system with

Scheduling

and

PowerChart

®

for orders and results.



In 2004, Cerner and its partner Atos Origin (formerly SchlumbergerSema) delivered key milestones in
bringing the Choose and Book system live in England. From a technical point of view, the project
is the most advanced deployment of the

Cerner Millennium

architecture to date. The Company
demonstrated that the solution could handle large volumes of transactions while meeting extremely
high service level requirements. The system handled about 2.8 million service requests per hour,
and the database managed 5,000 SQL executions per second. The testing validated the scalability and
performance of the

Cerner Millennium Web Experience

architecture.

Other countries and regions around the world are taking England’s lead for a countrywide
examination of HIT to modernize their healthcare systems. Across Europe, for example, there is an
increased understanding of the need for improved access to information to facilitate the frequent
movement of citizens across the European Union, according to a recent report by Frost & Sullivan.
Cerner is optimistic about the global market and is expanding to new countries and responding to
opportunities.

Packaged Solutions

Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE)

Cerner offers a total CPOE solution ranging from basic automation to complete medication
integration.

CPOE enables automated physician ordering of medications, diagnostic tests and treatment plans.
Orders are checked using decision-support tools to determine if they are in line with standards and
appropriate for the person’s individual situation. Physicians are alerted to potential problems and
prompted to consider alternatives. Actions are documented in the patient’s EMR.

Cerner’s CPOE solution facilitates safe and efficient care across multiple care venues. It goes
beyond automating the ordering process by embedding the latest clinical knowledge to provide
effective decision support and guidance. The solution is seamlessly unified with the EMR, pharmacy,
medication administration, care documentation and ancillary systems to close the loop in the
medication management process. By unifying care in this manner, Cerner CPOE helps clients address
potential errors across the entire process.

Cerner’s CPOE solution includes a physician-centric ordering application (

Software Development

Cerner commits significant resources to developing new health information system solutions. As of
January 1, 2005, approximately 1,752 associates were engaged full-time in software solutions
development activities. Total expenditures for the development and enhancement of the Company’s
software solutions were approximately $188,264,000, $179,999,000 and $149,985,000 during the 2004,
2003 and 2002 fiscal years, respectively. These figures include both capitalized and
non-capitalized portions and exclude amounts amortized for financial reporting purposes.

The Company expects to continue investment and development efforts for its current and future
solution offerings. As new clinical and management information needs emerge, Cerner intends to
enhance its current software solutions lines with new versions released to clients on a periodic
basis. In addition, Cerner plans to: expand its current software solution lines by developing
additional information systems for clinical, financial, operational and/or consumer use; continue
to support simultaneous use of Cerner’s solutions across multiple facilities; and, continue to
expand in the global marketplace.

The Company is committed to maintaining open attributes in its system architecture to achieve
operability in a diverse set of technical and application environments. The Company strives to
design its systems to co-exist with disparate applications developed and supported by other
suppliers. This effort is exemplified by Cerner’s

Open Engine Application Gateway

,

Open Port
Interface

and

MillenniumObjects

solutions lines.

Sales and Marketing

The markets for Cerner’s HIT solutions include integrated delivery networks, physician groups and
networks and their managed service organizations, managed care organizations, hospitals, medical
centers, free-standing reference laboratories, home health agencies, blood banks, imaging centers,
pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, employer coalitions and public health organizations. To
date, a substantial portion of system sales has been in clinical solutions in hospital-based
provider organizations. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is highly scalable, with solutions
being used in hospitals ranging from fewer than 50 beds to more than 2,000 beds and managed care
settings with more than 2,000,000 members. All

Cerner Millennium

solutions are designed to operate
on HP or IBM platforms, thereby allowing Cerner to be price competitive across the full size and
organizational structure range of healthcare providers. The sale of a health information system
usually takes approximately nine to 18 months, from the time of initial contact to the signing of a
contract.



The Company’s executive marketing management is located in its North Kansas City, Missouri,
headquarters, while its client representatives are deployed across the United States and globally.
In addition to the United States, the Company, through subsidiaries and joint ventures, has sales
staff and/or offices in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, India,
Singapore, Malaysia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. Cerner’s consolidated
revenues include foreign sales of $64,333,000, $54,191,000 and $36,634,000 for the 2004, 2003 and
2002 fiscal years, respectively.

The Company supports its sales force with technical personnel who perform demonstrations of

Cerner

solutions and assist clients in determining the proper hardware and software configurations. The
Company’s primary direct marketing strategy is to generate sales contacts from its existing client
base and through presentations at industry seminars and tradeshows. Cerner attends a number of
major tradeshows each year and sponsors executive user conferences, which feature industry experts
who address the HIT needs of large healthcare organizations.

Client Services

Significantly all of Cerner’s clients enter into software maintenance agreements with Cerner for
support of their

Cerner

systems. In addition to immediate software support in the event of
problems, these agreements allow clients the use of new releases of the

Cerner

solutions covered by
maintenance agreements. Each client has 24-hour access to the client support staff located at
Cerner’s world headquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri and the Company’s global support
organization in the United Kingdom. Most of Cerner’s clients also enter into hardware maintenance
agreements with Cerner. These arrangements normally provide for a fixed monthly fee for specified
services. In the majority of cases, Cerner subcontracts hardware maintenance to the hardware
manufacturer. Cerner also offers a set of managed services that include remote hosting,
application management services and disaster recovery.

Backlog

At January 1, 2005, Cerner had a contract backlog of approximately $1,191,170,000 as compared to
approximately $938,221,000 at January 3, 2004. Such backlog represents system sales from signed
contracts, which had not yet been recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue on a
percent of completion basis, based on certain milestone conditions, for its software solutions. At
January 1, 2005, the Company had approximately $96,909,000 of contracts receivable, which
represents revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method but not yet billable under
the terms of the contract. At January 1, 2005, Cerner had a software support and maintenance
backlog of approximately $347,662,000 as compared to approximately $312,887,000 at January 3, 2004.
Such backlog represents contracted software support and hardware maintenance services for a period
of twelve months. The Company estimates that approximately 44% percent of the aggregate backlog at
January 1, 2005 of $1,538,832,000 will be recognized as revenue during 2005.

Competition

The Company faces a highly competitive environment in the HIT market. The market for HIT solutions
and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change.
The Company’s principal existing competitors include Eclipsys Corporation, Epic Systems
Corporation, GE Medical Systems, IDX Systems Corporation, iSoft Corporation, McKesson Corporation,
Medical Information Technology, Inc. (“Meditech”), Misys Healthcare Systems and Siemens Medical
Solutions Health Services Corporation, each of which offers a suite of software solutions and
services that compete with many of the Company’s software solutions and services. There are other
competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions and services. In
addition, the Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information
technology consulting service providers and system integrators, Internet-based start-up companies
and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software/solutions or
services. The pace of change in the HIT systems market is rapid and there are frequent new
software solution introductions, software solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and
requirements. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include
the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings, the stability of the information
systems provider, the features and capabilities of the information



systems, the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future
compatible software solutions.

Item 2. Properties

The Company’s world headquarters offices are located in a Company-owned office park in North Kansas
City, Missouri, containing approximately 739,000 square feet of useable space (the “Campus”),
inclusive of the new buildings described below. As of January 1, 2005, the Company was using
approximately 736,000 square feet and substantially all of the remainder was leased to tenants. In
2004, the Company purchased approximately 12 acres of unimproved real estate adjacent to the Cerner
World Headquarters for campus expansion. An access road has been built to the property; plans are
underway for further development. In November 2004, the Company entered into a lease for
approximately 127,000 rentable square feet of property located at 3315 North Oak Trafficway in
Kansas City, Missouri. The office space, known as the Cerner Oaks Campus, will initially house
associates from the Cerner Managed Services and Cerner Technologies groups. The lease contains an
option to purchase the building at fair value. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company began
construction of a new facility situated between the buildings located at 2800 and 2900 Rockcreek
Parkway on the Campus. This facility was completed on August 1, 2003 and is approximately 123,000
gross square feet in size. This new facility, referred to as Cerner’s World Headquarters Building,
houses offices, a cafeteria and meeting space for the Company. In 2002, the Company also began
construction of a new office building located on the Campus. This facility, approximately 200,000
gross square feet in size, was completed in December 2003 and houses office and meeting space for
the Company.

The Company also owns property located along the north riverbank of the Missouri River,
approximately 2 miles from the Company’s Campus. This property consists of an 80,000 square foot
building and a 1,300-car parking garage. The building has been renovated for use as a corporate
training, meeting and event center for the Company and third parties. The Company has also made
use of the parking garage to meet overflow-parking demands on the Company’s Campus.

As of March 2005, the Company also leased office space in: Birmingham, Alabama; Beverly Hills,
California; Denver, Colorado; Alpharetta, Georgia; Overland Park, Kansas; Waltham, Massachusetts;
Bel Air, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; Charlotte,
North Carolina; Beaverton, Oregon; Houston, Texas; and Vienna, Virginia. The Company operates its
primary solutions center (or data center) in leased space in Lee’s Summit, Missouri. Globally, the
Company also leases office space in: Sydney, Australia; Brussels, Belgium; Santiago, Chile;
London-Ontario, Canada; London, England; Paris, France; Aachen and Idstein, Germany; Bangalore,
India; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Barcelona, Spain. In 2004, the Company’s Detroit, Michigan and
St. Louis, Missouri offices were closed as the Company relocated many associates to its World
Headquarters Campus.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously disclosed, the Company received notice in April 2003 that three shareholder class
action lawsuits were filed against it and five of its officers in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Missouri. Subsequently, five additional shareholder class action
lawsuits were filed against the Company. All of these lawsuits were filed after a decline in the
Company’s stock price following the Company’s announcement on April 3, 2003 that the Company would
not meet revenue and earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2003.

On August 20, 2003, the Court ordered that all of the lawsuits be consolidated under Case No.
03-CV-00296-DW and appointed Phil Crabtree as Lead Plaintiff. On December 1, 2003, the Lead
Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint. In general, the consolidated complaint
alleges that, during a class period commencing as of July 17, 2002 and ending April 2, 2003, the
Company and individually named defendants misrepresented or failed to disclose certain factors,
which they allege impacted the Company’s business and anticipated revenue and earnings, all
allegedly in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 thereunder.

On June 16, 2004 the Court granted the Company’s and the individual defendants’ Motion to Dismiss
and ordered the Consolidated Class Action Complaint dismissed with prejudice against re-filing. On
June 30, 2004, the Lead Plaintiff appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the action to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The parties filed their appellate briefs
and the issues were argued before the Eighth Circuit on January 13, 2005. The matter is now
submitted to the Eighth Circuit for decision but the Company does not know when the Court of
Appeals will rule on the appeal.

The Company believes that the District Court was correct in dismissing the consolidated complaint
and that all the claims asserted in that complaint are without merit. In the event that the Court
of Appeals reverses the District Court’s dismissal, the Company intends to continue with its
vigorous defense of those claims.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company during the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the “Company”) is headquartered in North Kansas City, Missouri.
Cerner derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions and hardware that
gives healthcare providers secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real
time, allowing them to improve the quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare.
Cerner implements these solutions as stand-alone, combined or enterprise-wide systems.

Cerner

solutions can be managed by the Company’s clients or in Cerner’s data center via a managed services
model.

Results Overview

The Company delivered strong results in 2004. Total new business bookings, which reflect the value
of contracts for software, hardware, services and managed services (hosting of software in the
Company’s data center), were $917,367,000 in 2004, an increase of 13% compared to $811,258,000 in
2003.

Total revenues for 2004 were $926,356,000, an increase of 10% compared to 2003. The revenue
composition was $351,861,000 in system sales, $241,439,000 in support and maintenance, $300,975,000
in services and $32,081,000 in reimbursed travel. Systems sales revenue, which includes licensed
software, sub-licensed software, hardware, and subscriptions, grew 6% in 2004. Services revenue,
which includes managed services, grew 13% for the year. Support and maintenance revenue grew 15%
for the year.

The Company’s solid bookings drove a 27% year-over-year increase in contract backlog, which
reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue, and ended the year at
$1,191,170,000. Backlog grew faster than revenue again in 2004 as the Company continued to
experience strong growth in managed services and subscription bookings, which are recognized as
revenue over a longer period of time than other types of bookings, such as software and hardware.
Collectively, managed services and subscription bookings accounted for about 24% of total bookings
margin in 2004 compared to approximately 20% in 2003 and 15% in 2002. This continued shift in mix
provides greater visibility of revenue going into 2005 and beyond.

The strong growth in managed services bookings contributed to a decline in hardware bookings and
hardware revenue in 2004 as clients electing managed services do not need to make the upfront
hardware purchase that they would make in a transaction that does not include managed services. As
a result, hardware revenue declined 18% in 2004 compared to 2003. Licensed software revenue grew
at a strong rate of 14% in 2004

,

but this growth was partially offset by the decline in hardware
revenue, resulting in lower system sales growth of 6% for 2004. Despite the near-term impact on
system sales, the Company views this mix shift favorably because the higher level of managed
services bookings improves the visibility of future revenue streams.

Net earnings increased from $42,791,000 in 2003 to $64,648,000 in 2004. Included in 2004 results
are an adjustment in the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay accrual (see
Note 14 to consolidated financial statements) that reduced net earnings by $2,076,000, net of
$1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated in the first quarter of 2004
that increased net earnings by $1,826,000, net of $1,197,000 of tax. Excluding these two items,
2004 net earnings would have been $250,000 higher, or $64,898,000.

The increase in net earnings was driven by revenue growth and margin expansion. Operating margins
were 12.0% (12.4% prior to the vacation accrual adjustment) for 2004 compared to 9.3% in 2003.
Going forward, management believes the Company can continue to increase operating margins by
expanding margins on services, leveraging investments in research and development, and controlling
sales, general and administrative spending.



The Company’s operational performance was also very strong in 2004. The Company brought a record
1,079

Cerner Millennium

solutions live in 2004, bringing the cumulative number of solutions
implemented to more than 3,700 at nearly 750 client facilities. These results included significant
progress at implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), which is the application
generating the highest level of industry attention.

The Company’s strong operational performance is also reflected in its cash flow results. In 2004,
the Company generated $168,304,000 of cash flow from operations, compared to $134,150,000 in 2003.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software,
was $52,902,000 in 2004 compared to ($8,169,000) in 2003.

Healthcare Information Technology Market

The Company believes the market for healthcare information technology remains strong. The
healthcare information technology industry, and Cerner specifically, continues to benefit from the
focus healthcare providers have placed on using technology to drive major patient safety and
quality initiatives into their organizations with the ultimate goal of becoming completely digital
or paperless. In addition, the Company continues to benefit from its clients’ increased desire to
have a common architecture spanning clinical, management and financial solutions.

In many ways, the Company believes 2004 was a defining year for the healthcare information
technology industry. President Bush began the year by proclaiming in his State of the Union
Address that we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs and improve care by
computerizing health records. The President also established a goal for every American to have a
personal health record within the next 10 years, and he reaffirmed that goal in his 2005 State of
the Union Address. In the spring of 2004, the President created a sub-cabinet position at the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to spearhead this effort. In the summer of 2004,
Senator Hillary Clinton and Majority Leader Bill Frist took to the pages of the Washington Post to
opine in bipartisan fashion that information technology is central to solving the healthcare
crisis. And as the Democratic and Republican parties laid out their agendas in January of 2005 for
the 109th Congress, both signaled a strong commitment to healthcare information technology.

Finally, 2004 saw more widespread adoption of pay-for-performance compensation systems for both
hospitals and physician offices. Employers such as General Motors, Delta Airlines, UPS, Verizon,
General Electric, and Boeing led the way both at the company level and through The Leapfrog Group’s
standards. And in February of 2005, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced
the first ever Medicare pay-for-performance initiative for doctors.

In summary, 2004 was an exciting year of increased focus on healthcare information technology.
Although no assurances can be provided, management believes, and recent events suggest, that this
momentum could continue.

Results of Operations

Year Ended January 1, 2005, Compared to Year Ended January 3, 2004

The Company’s revenues increased 10% to $926,356,000 in 2004 from $839,587,000 in 2003. The
Company had net earnings of $64,648,000 in 2004 compared to $42,791,000 in 2003. Included in 2004
net earnings are an adjustment in the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay
accrual that reduced net earnings by $2,076,000, net of $1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale
of Zynx Health Incorporated, in the first quarter of 2004 that increased net earnings by
$1,826,000, net of $1,197,000 of tax. Excluding these two items, 2004 net earnings would have been
$250,000 higher, or $64,898,000.

Revenues

- In 2004, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales, support of installed
systems and an increase in services. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 14% to
$542,414,000 in 2004 from $476,795,000 in 2003. Support and maintenance revenues were $241,439,000
and $209,876,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Services revenues were $300,975,000



and $266,918,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service
revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, managed services and professional
services, excluding installation. The increase in support and maintenance revenue was due
primarily to the increase in the Company’s installed and converted client base, that was driven by
bringing a record number of

Cerner Millennium

solutions live in 2003 and 2004. The increase in
services revenue was driven by increased professional services billable hours and a strong increase
in managed services.

System sales increased 6% to $351,861,000 in 2004 from $332,349,000 in 2003. Included in system
sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. This increase is
due primarily to an increase in license software sales that was partially offset by declines in
hardware sales.

At January 1, 2005, the Company had $1,191,170,000 in contract backlog and $347,662,000 in support
and maintenance backlog, compared to $938,221,000 in contract backlog and $312,887,000 in support
and maintenance backlog at the end of 2003.

Cost of Revenues

- The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party
consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased
from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of
hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost
of revenues was 21% of total revenues in 2004, and 23% of total revenues in 2003. Such costs, as a
percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and
support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in
the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from a decrease in the
percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of
revenue percentage. The Company believes this trend could continue because of strong demand for
its managed service offering, which results in lower hardware sales because the client does not
purchase hardware when it chooses this offering.

Sales and Client Service

- Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service
personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and
marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a
percent of total revenues were 41% and 42% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in total
sales and client service expenses to $383,628,000 in 2004 from $352,728,000 in 2003 is primarily
due to an increase in personnel and personnel related expenses. The decrease in this spending as a
percent of total revenue reflects the Company’s ability to get better utilization of its resources
and leverage this spending over a larger revenue stream.

Software Development

- Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other
direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs.
Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized
portions, for 2004 and 2003 were $188,264,000 and $179,999,000, respectively. These amounts
exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $58,912,000 and $58,736,000 for 2004 and
2003, respectively. The increase in aggregate expenditures in software development in 2004 is due
to continued development of

Cerner Millennium

solutions.

General and Administrative

- General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate,
financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees.
These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in both 2004 and 2003. Total general and
administrative expenses were $63,327,000 and $58,236,000 for 2004 and 2003, respectively. General
and administrative expenses for 2004 include a prior period adjustment to increase vacation pay
accrual of $3,346,000. Excluding the adjustment to increase vacation pay accrual, general and
administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 6% in 2004.

Interest Expense, Net

-

Interest income was $3,022,000 in 2004 compared to $1,219,000 in 2003.
This increase is due primarily to higher interest rates, and a higher cash balance fed by cash
collections. Interest expense was $9,174,000 in 2004 compared to $8,236,000 in 2003.



Other Income, Net

- Other income increased from $142,000 in 2003 to $2,608,000 in 2004. This
increase is due primarily to a gain on the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated. Also included in
other income are revenues from office space leased to third parties.

Operations by Segment

In 2003, the Company organized geographically. The Company’s six geographic business segments are:
Great Lakes, Mid-America, North Atlantic, Southeast, West and Global. Revenues are derived
primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and administrative information systems and
solutions. The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services, computer
hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery
to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support
subcontracted to the manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred by the geographic business
segments consist of sales and client service expenses including salaries of sales and client
service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Performance of the
segments is assessed at the operating earnings level and, therefore, the segment operations have
been presented as such. “Other” includes revenues not generated by the operating segments and
expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative and depreciation that
have not been allocated to the operating segments. The Company does not track assets by
geographical business segment.

Operating earnings in the Great Lakes segment increased 9% for the year ended January 1, 2005
compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 2% in 2004 compared to 2003.
The increase in total revenues is due primarily to strong increases in licensed software and
support revenues that were largely offset by a decrease in hardware and professional services
revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 19% and 24% of total revenues of the
Great Lakes segment for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the cost of revenues as a
percent of revenue is due primarily to lower hardware sales in 2004 as compared to 2003. Costs of
revenues, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software,
hardware, maintenance, support, services and reimbursed travel) components carrying different
margin rates changes from period to period.



Operating earnings in the Mid-America segment increased 37% for the year ended January 1, 2005
compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 25% in 2004 compared to 2003.
The increase in total revenues is due primarily to a strong increase in licensed software and
professional services revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 16% and 22% of
total Mid-America segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the cost of
revenues as a percent of revenue is due primarily to lower hardware sales in 2004 as compared to
2003.

Operating earnings in the North Atlantic segment increased 27% for the year ended January 1, 2005
compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 20% in 2004 compared to 2003.
The increase in revenues is due primarily to an increase in licensed software and professional
services revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 23% and 25% of total North
Atlantic segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Operating earnings in the Southeast segment increased 6% for the year ended January 1, 2005
compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 2% in 2004 compared to 2003.
Costs of revenues were 24% and 28% of total Southeast segment revenues for 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The increase in total revenues is due primarily to strong increases in licensed
software and support revenues that were largely offset by a decrease in hardware and professional
services in 2004 compared to 2003.

Operating earnings in the West decreased 16% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the
year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues decreased 7% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in
total revenues is due primarily to a decrease in licensed software in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs
of revenues were 19% and 17% of total West segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Operating expenses increased 20% in 2004 compared to 2003, due primarily to an increase in
personnel related expenses.

Operating earnings in the Global segment increased 245% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared
to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 19% in 2004 compared to 2003. The
increase in total revenues is due primarily to an increase in professional services in 2004
compared to 2003. Operating expenses increased 7% in 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are
due primarily to an increased presence in the global market.

Operating losses in Other increased 9% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year
ended January 3, 2004. This increase is due to an increase in total costs and expenses of 11% in
2004 compared to 2003. The increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in expenses such
as software development, marketing, general and administrative and depreciation in 2004 compared to
2003.

Year Ended January 3, 2004, Compared to Year Ended December 28, 2002

The Company’s revenues increased 8% to $839,587,000 in 2003 from $780,262,000 in 2002. The Company
had net earnings of $42,791,000 in 2003 compared to $48,022,000 in 2002. Operating results for
2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available-for-sale securities and a charge
for the impairment of investments, and a change in accounting principle for goodwill. The decrease
in net earnings is due primarily to a higher increase in expenses than revenue compared to the
prior year. As discussed above, revenue increased less than the Company expected because of the
decrease in new contract bookings in the first quarter of 2003 and the shift in bookings mix to
more managed services and subscription bookings which are recognized as revenue over longer periods
of time. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by continued investments in the Company’s
development of software and by sales and client services expenses. Expenses also increased because
the Company’s 2003 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2002.

Revenues

- In 2003, revenues increased due to an increase in support of installed systems and an
increase in services. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 14% to $476,795,000 in
2003 from $419,578,000 in 2002. Support and maintenance revenues were $209,877,000 and
$171,238,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Services revenues were $266,918,000 and $248,340,000
in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support
and



maintenance of software and hardware and professional services, excluding installation. This
increase in support and maintenance revenue was due primarily to the increase in the Company’s
installed and converted client base, that was driven by bringing a record number of

Cerner
Millennium

solutions live in 2002 and 2003. The increase in services revenue was driven primarily
by an increase in revenue from managed services, which increased $20,000,000 to $34,000,000 as the
Company continued to experience high levels of demand for hosting solutions in its data center.

System sales were $332,349,000 in 2003 compared to $332,274,000 in 2002. Included in system sales
are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. System sales were flat
because of the aforementioned first quarter bookings shortfall and because of a shift in the mix of
bookings during the year.

At January 3, 2004, the Company had $938,221,000 in contract backlog and $312,887,000 in support
and maintenance backlog, compared to $732,719,000 in contract backlog and $269,153,000 in support
and maintenance backlog at the end of 2002.

Cost of Revenues

- The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party
consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased
from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of
hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost
of revenues was 23% of total revenues in 2003, and 24% of total revenues in 2002. Such costs, as a
percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and
support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in
the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from a decrease in the
percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of
revenue percentage.

Sales and Client Service

- Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service
personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and
marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a
percent of total revenues were 42% and 41% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in total
sales and client service expenses is attributable to the cost of marketing of solutions. Expenses
also increased due to the extra week in the 2003 fiscal year as described above.

Software Development

- Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other
direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs.
Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized
portions, for 2003 and 2002 were $179,999,000 and $149,985,000, respectively. These amounts
exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $58,736,000 and $49,984,000 for 2003 and
2002, respectively.

General and Administrative

- General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate,
financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees.
These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% and 6% in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Interest Expense, Net

-

Interest income was $1,219,000 in 2003 compared to $1,080,000 in 2002.
This increase is due primarily to an increase in invested cash in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest
expense was $8,236,000 in 2003 compared to $6,635,000 in 2002. This increase is due primarily to
the increase in debt. On December 20, 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement
of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated December 15, 2002.

Other Income, Net

- Other income increased to $142,000 in 2003 from $87,000 in 2002. Included in
other revenues are revenues from office space leased to third parties.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment —

In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of
WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The
warrants were scheduled to expire on January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold
1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of
$527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a result of the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the
shares. In the second



quarter of 2002, the Company sold 14,820,527 shares of WebMD for $90,119,000. Accordingly, the
Company recorded an investment gain of $2,736,000, net of $1,572,000 in tax, as a result of the
sale.

Impairment of Investment —

The Company’s policy is to review declines in fair value of its
marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary. Based on events
occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of tax of
$3,623,000, for the impairment of various investments in non-publicly traded securities. The
charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Company’s investment in
Protocare, Inc. a non-publicly traded company.

Income Taxes

- The Company’s effective tax rate was 39.9% in 2003 and 39.4% in 2002. As a result
of a decrease in net income from 2002 to 2003, the impact of permanent differences increased the
Company’s effective tax rate.

Accounting Change

- Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a
result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are
evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is
assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The
Company completed its transitional review of the Company’s goodwill values in the second quarter of
2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the
acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this
business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re-engineering consulting practice. The
impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The
Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the
Company’s revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in
software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents. The majority of the
Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities,
short-term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. At January 1, 2005 the
Company had cash and cash equivalents of $189,784,000 and working capital of $310,229,000 compared
to cash and cash equivalents of $121,839,000 and working capital of $246,412,000 at January 3,
2004.

The Company generated cash of $168,304,000, $134,150,000 and $36,906,000 from operations in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2004 due primarily to
increased collections of receivables, improved payment terms and record level conversions. The
Company has periodically provided long-term financing options to creditworthy clients through third
party financing institutions and typically has directly provided extended payment terms from
contract date. Some of these payment streams have been assigned on a non-recourse basis to third
party financing institutions. The Company has provided its usual and customary performance
guarantees to the third party financing institutions in connection with its on-going obligations
under the client contract. During 2004 and 2003, the Company generated cash flow from third party
client financing arrangements and non-recourse payment assignments aggregating $53,319,000 and
$58,654,000, respectively. Days sales outstanding increased from 103 days at the end of 2003 to
104 days at the end of 2004. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent
recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 15% in 2004 and 23% in 2003, and
the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows.

Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capitalized software development costs of
$58,912,000 and $58,736,000 and purchases of capital equipment, land and buildings of $56,490,000

and $83,583,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company completed acquisitions of businesses
for



$1,957,000 and $6,380,000, net of cash received, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
completed the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated in 2004 for $12,000,000.

The Company’s financing activities for 2004 primarily consisted of repayment of debt of $24,879,000
and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $25,717,000. Financing activities for 2003
primarily consisted of the repayment of long term debt of $13,238,000, the purchase of treasury
stock of $5,930,000 and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $6,703,000.

Prior to May 2002, the Company had a loan agreement with a bank that provided for a current
revolving line of credit for working capital purposes. In May 2002, the Company expanded its
credit facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks led
by U.S. Bank. The new credit facility increased the amount the Company may borrow from $45,000,000
to $90,000,000. The fee rate on the new facility is approximately the same as the prior facility.
The revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only. Interest
is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (5.25% at January 1, 2005) or LIBOR
(2.4% at January 1, 2005) plus 2%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15% if certain net
worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, debt levels and fixed
charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow,
incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 3/10% to 1/2% is payable quarterly
based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May
31, 2007. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 1, 2005. At January 1,
2005, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available
for working capital purposes. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its
revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the
medical business division of VitalWorks, Inc. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in
three equal annual installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a
$39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning
December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the bank loan
agreement and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and
fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to
borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at January 1, 2005.

In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in
five equal annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a
$40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments beginning April
2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the
remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position.
The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current, and fixed charge coverage covenants and
provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay
dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 1, 2005.

The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations
and the line of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2005.

The following table represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial
commitments as of January 1, 2005, except short-term purchase order commitments arising in the
ordinary course of business.

The effects of inflation on the Company’s business during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were not
significant.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123
(revised 2004), Share Based Payments (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which replaces SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” SFAS No. 123(R) addresses the accounting for share-based payments transactions with
employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be
recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The new standard is effective in the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that
the Statement may have on its consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding
the Company’s historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of
revenue and other significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. These
significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development,
concentrations, allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These
policies and the Company’s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and
under specific areas within this “Management Discussion and Analysis or Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.” In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon
discussion of the Company’s accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software-related
services, using the residual method under SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
SOP No. 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) 101 “Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements” and SAB No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). Key factors in
the Company’s revenue recognition model are management’s assessments that installation services are
essential to the functionality of the Company’s software whereas implementation services are not.
If the Company’s business model were to change such that implementation services became essential
to the functionality of the Company’s software, the period of time over which the Company’s
licensed software revenue were to be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally recognizes
revenue from the sale of its licensed software over two key milestones, delivery and installation,
based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation.
Additionally, if the time to achieve the Company’s delivery and installation milestones for its
licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated, its milestones would be adjusted and the
timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change.



Software Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological
feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all
software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost
or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future
revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight-line
amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing
capitalized costs over five years.

The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology
consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare
industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the healthcare
information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product
enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized
software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

Concentrations

Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are held
at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Company’s cash equivalents consist
of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable securities and overnight
repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on
such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal
risk.

Substantially all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks, hospitals and other
healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to impact
these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access to
certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The
inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future
results.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

If the creditworthiness of the Company’s clients were to weaken or the Company’s collections
results relative to historical experience were to decline, it could have a material adverse impact
on operations and cash flows.

Goodwill

The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment
annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting
unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its
transitional review of the Company’s goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of
this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and
Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and
Associates was a supply chain re-engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect
this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company again assessed its
goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of 2004 and 2003 and concluded that no goodwill was
impaired. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the
reporting units for all periods. The Company completed five acquisitions and one divestiture
subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately $35 million of goodwill that was not
amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. Goodwill amounted to $54,600,000 and $51,573,000 at January
1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Company’s
reporting units, that recognized goodwill, do not materialize as expected the Company’s goodwill
could be impaired, which would result in significant write-offs.



Factors that may Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business

Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders in which this report is made a
part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
communications to shareholders, press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the
Company that are not historical in nature, or that state the Company’s or management’s intentions,
hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may constitute “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, such as “could,” “should,” “will,” “intended,” “continue,” “believe,”
“may,” “expect,” “hope,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “forecast,” “plan,” “guidance” or “estimate” or the
negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are
not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual results, financial
condition or business, could differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not
limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere herein or in other reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unforeseen factors not identified herein
could also have such an effect. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise
forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events
or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time.

Quarterly Operating Results May Vary

—  The Company’s quarterly operating results have
varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods, including, variations from guidance,
expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of
reasons including accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities, demand for the
Company’s software solutions and services, the Company’s long sales cycle, potentially long
installation and implementation cycles for these larger, more complex and costlier systems and
other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of healthcare
industry trends and the market for the Company’s

Cerner Millennium

solutions, a large percentage of
the Company’s revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and
costlier systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant
technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. Sales may be
subject to delays due to changes in clients’ internal budgets, procedures for approving large
capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, availability of personnel
resources and by actions undertaken by competitors. Delays in the expected sale or installation
of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the Company’s anticipated quarterly
revenues and consequently its earnings, since a significant percentage of the Company’s expenses
are relatively fixed.

The Company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount
of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the Company’s and the client’s ability to meet
these project milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the
contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition
from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a
particular quarter. The Company’s revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the
first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of
the clients’ year-end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the then current year.

Stock Price May Be Volatile

—  The trading price of the Company’s common stock may be
volatile. The market for the Company’s common stock may experience significant price and volume
fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly
variations in operating results, rumors about the Company’s performance or software solutions,
changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities
analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client relationship
developments, changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other factors, many of
which are beyond the Company’s control. As a matter of policy, the Company does not generally
comment on rumors.



Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software and healthcare and
information technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has
been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and
industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company’s common stock,
regardless of actual operating performance.

Changes in the Healthcare Industry

— The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is
subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. For example, the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-32) contained significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid and
had an impact for several years on healthcare providers’ ability to invest in capital intensive
systems. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is
having a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized
transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the
protection of patient health information. These factors affect the purchasing practices and
operation of healthcare organizations. Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered
programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to
change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. These programs may contain proposals to
increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the
environment in which healthcare industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants
may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments
in the Company’s software solutions and services.

Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with
greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price
reductions for the Company’s software solutions and services. As the healthcare industry
consolidates, the Company’s client base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more
intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater.

Significant Competition

— The market for healthcare information systems is intensely
competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. The Company believes that
the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and
software solution offerings, the stability of the information systems provider, the features and
capabilities of the information systems, the ongoing support for the system and the potential for
enhancements and future compatible software solutions.

Certain of the Company’s competitors have greater financial, technical, product development,
marketing and other resources than the Company and some of its competitors offer software solutions
that it does not offer. The Company’s principal existing competitors include; Eclipsys
Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, GE Medical Systems, IDX Systems Corporation, iSoft
Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. (“Meditech”), Misys
Healthcare Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, each of which offers
a suite of software solutions that compete with many of the Company’s software solutions and
services. There are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software
solutions.

In addition, the Company expects that major software information systems companies, large
information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, Internet-based start-up
companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive
software/solutions or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is
rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions, software solution enhancements
and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the Company’s success will depend
upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce, on a timely and
cost-effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client
requirements and achieve market acceptance.

Proprietary Technology May Be Subjected to Infringement Claims or May Be Infringed Upon

- -The Company relies upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee
nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy
of its proprietary information. The Company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to protect
its intellectual property. The Company has initiated a patent program but currently has a limited
patent



portfolio. As a result, the Company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its
intellectual property.

In addition, the Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the
number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software solutions and services expands.
These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If the Company becomes liable
to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, it could be required to pay a
substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling
the software solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property.

Government Regulation

— The healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local, state and
federal level. Consequently, the Company may be subject to such regulations, which include
regulation in the areas of healthcare fraud, medical devices and the security and privacy of
patient data, and the risk of changes in the various local, state and federal laws.

Healthcare Fraud.

The federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over
practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed
by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Healthcare providers who are
clients of the Company are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other
things, prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient
referrals, or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in
part by these federal or state healthcare programs. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare
fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers and remedies to
pursue suspected fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation of the Company’s clients
is difficult to predict. While the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with any
applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to the Company’s clients and that may be
applicable to the Company, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts.
They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner
that could require the Company’s clients to make changes in their operations or the way that they
deal with the Company. If the such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to the
Company and if the Company fails to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, it could be
subject to sanctions or liability, including exclusion from government health programs and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial
condition.

Regulation of Medical Devices.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has
declared that certain of the Company’s software solutions are medical devices that are actively
regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“Act”) and amendments to the Act. As a
consequence, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to those
software solutions that are actively regulated. If other of the Company’s software solutions are
deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, the Company could be subject to
extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing requirements including pre-market
notification clearance prior to marketing. Complying with these FDA regulations would be time
consuming and expensive. It is possible that the FDA may become more active in regulating computer
software that is used in healthcare.

There have been six FDA inspections since 1998 at various Cerner sites. Inspections conducted at
the Company’s World Headquarters in 1999 and its Houston facility in 2002 each resulted in the
issuance of an FDA Form 483 that the Company responded to promptly. The FDA has taken no further
action with respect to either of the Form 483s that were issued in 1998 and 2002. The remaining
four FDA inspections, including an inspection at the Company’s World Headquarters in 2004, resulted
in no issuance of a Form 483. The Company, however, remains subject to periodic FDA inspections
and there can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to undertake additional
actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure by
the Company to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its
software solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions,
civil fines and/or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.



Security and Privacy of Patient Information .

State and federal laws regulate the
confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released.
These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record
information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures.
Regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve
and are often unclear and difficult to apply.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) requires national
standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used
in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health
information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information.
Covered entities under HIPAA, which include healthcare organizations such as the Company’s clients,
were required to comply with the privacy standards by April 2003 and additional transaction
regulations by October 2003. Such organizations must also be in compliance with security
regulations by April 2005. As a business associate of the covered entities, the Company, in most
instances, must also ensure compliance with the HIPAA regulations.

The effect of HIPAA on the Company’s business is difficult to predict, and there can be no
assurances that the Company will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its
implementation, or that the Company will be able to take advantage of any resulting business
opportunities. Furthermore, the Company is unable to predict what changes to HIPAA, or the
regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA, might be made in the future or how those changes could affect
the Company’s business or the costs of compliance with HIPAA. Evolving HIPAA-related laws or
regulations could restrict the ability of the Company’s clients to obtain, use or disseminate
patient information. This could adversely affect demand for the Company’s solutions if they are not
re-designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that seek
to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable the Company’s clients to execute new
or modified healthcare transactions. The Company may need to expend additional capital, research
and development and other resources to modify its solutions to address these evolving data security
and privacy issues.

Product Related Liabilities

— Many of the Company’s software solutions provide data for use
by healthcare providers in providing care to patients. Although no such claims have been brought
against the Company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its software solutions, such
claims may be made in the future. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance
coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business, there can be no assurance
that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future, prove to be
adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. A
successful claim brought against the Company, which is uninsured, or under-insured could materially
harm its business, results of operations or financial condition.

System Errors and Warranties

— The Company’s systems, particularly the

Cerner Millennium

versions, are very complex. As with complex systems offered by others, the Company’s systems may
contain errors, especially when first introduced. Although the Company conducts extensive testing,
it has discovered software errors in its software solutions after their introduction. The
Company’s systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in
the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users of the Company software solutions have a
greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally. The
Company’s agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and
other matters. Failure of a client’s system to meet these criteria could constitute a material
breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract and obtain a refund and/or
damages, or could require the Company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet
these criteria. The Company’s contracts with its clients generally limit the Company’s liability
arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or
circumstances. A successful claim brought against the Company, which is uninsured, or
under-insured could materially harm its business, results of operations or financial condition.

Risks Associated with the Company’s Global Operations

— The Company markets, sells and
services its software solutions globally. The Company has established offices around the world,
including in the Americas, Europe, in the Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. The Company
will continue to



expand its global operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales
and support channels. The business transacted is in the local functional currency and the Company
does not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses. All
other business transactions are in U.S. dollars. To date, the Company has not entered into any
derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk. In some countries, the Company’s
success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. There is a
risk that the Company may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, the Company may
not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for its software solutions.

Global operations are subject to inherent risks, and the Company’s future results could be
adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include:

Recruitment and Retention of Key Personnel

— To remain competitive in the healthcare
information technology industry, the Company must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled
managerial, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel, including executives,
consultants, programmers and systems architects skilled in the healthcare information technology
industry and the technical environments in which the Company’s solutions operate. Competition for
such personnel in this industry is intense. The Company’s failure to attract additional qualified
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s prospects for long-term growth.
The success of the Company is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of
key management, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel. The Company has succession
plans in place; however, the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact
to the Company’s business and results of operations, and could potentially inhibit solution
development and market share advances.

Third Party Suppliers

— The Company licenses or purchases intellectual property and
technology (such as software, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors,
and incorporates it into or sells it in conjunction with the Company’s software solutions and
services, some of which intellectual property or technology is critical to the operation of the
Company’s solutions. If any of the third party suppliers were to change product offerings,
increase prices or terminate the Company’s licenses or supply contracts, the Company might need to
seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure
continued performance of the Company’s solutions. Such alternatives may not be available on
attractive terms, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or
technology provided by the Company’s existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing, purchasing or
maintaining these third party intellectual property or technology solutions significantly
increases, the Company’s gross margin levels could significantly decrease. In addition,
interruption in functionality of the Company’s solutions could adversely affect future sales of
licenses and services.

Sales Forecasts

— The Company’s sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular
quarter. The Company uses a “pipeline” system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and
trends in its business. The Company’s sales associates monitor the status of all sales
opportunities, such as the date



when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of
the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. The Company
compares this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in its business. This analysis
provides guidance in business planning and forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their
nature speculative. The Company’s pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of
revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, partially because of changes in
the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to
estimate. A variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts, or
in the pipeline itself, could cause the Company’s plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby
adversely affect business results. For example, a slowdown in information technology spending, or
economic conditions or a variety of other reasons can cause purchasing decisions to be delayed,
reduced in amount or cancelled, which would reduce the overall pipeline conversion rate in a
particular period of time. Because a substantial portion of the Company’s contracts are completed
in the latter part of a quarter, the Company may not be able to adjust its cost structure promptly
in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in its pipeline conversion rate in any
given fiscal quarter(s).

Item 9.A.

Controls and Procedures

a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report (the
“Evaluation Date”). They have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within
those entities and would be disclosed on a timely basis.

b)

There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
during the year ended January 1, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.

c)

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, cannot provide complete assurance that its disclosure controls and procedures or
the Company’s internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Cerner have been
detected.



Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended). The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005. In making this assessment, the Company’s
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company’s management has
concluded that, as of January 1, 2005, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on these criteria. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
that audited the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report has issued an
audit report on the Company’s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting, which is
included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

,

that Cerner Corporation (the Corporation) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Cerner Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Cerner
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January 1, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries as of
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 1, 2005, and
our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Corporation) as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended January 1, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 1,
2005 and January 3, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended January 1, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Cerner Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of January 1, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of,
and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report

The management of Cerner Corporation is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and
all other information presented in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances,
and, therefore, included in the financial statements are certain amounts based on management’s
informed estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with
that in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been
audited by Cerner Corporation’s independent certified public accountants and have been reviewed by
the audit committee of the Board of Directors.

N

otes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cerner Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Nature of Operations

- The Company designs, develops, markets, installs, hosts and supports
software information technology and content solutions for healthcare organizations and consumers.
The Company also implements these solutions as individual, combined or enterprise-wide systems.

(c)

Revenue Recognition

- Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and
administrative information systems and solutions. The components of the system sales revenues are
the licensing of computer software, installation, subscription content and the sale of computer
hardware and sublicensed software. The components of support, maintenance and service revenues are
software support and hardware maintenance, remote hosting and outsourcing, training, consulting and
implementation services.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP)
97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff
Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) 101 “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” and SAB No. 104
“Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21 “Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). SOP 97-2, as amended, generally requires
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple-elements to be allocated to each element
based on the relative fair values of those elements. Revenue from multiple-element software
arrangements is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, revenue is
recognized in a multiple-element arrangement when Company-specific objective evidence of fair value
exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. professional services, software
support, hardware maintenance, hardware and sublicensed software), but does not exist for one or
more of the delivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. software solutions). The Company allocates
revenue to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based on the element’s respective fair
value, with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately.
Specifically, the Company determines the fair value of the software support and maintenance portion
of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the software support and maintenance charged to
clients; professional services portion of the arrangement, other than installation services, based
on hourly rates which the Company charges for these services when sold apart from a software
license; and, the hardware and sublicensed software, based on the prices for these elements when
they are sold separately from the software. If evidence of the fair value cannot be established
for the undelivered elements of a license agreement, the entire amount of revenue under the
arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be
established.

Inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments,
which influence the timing and the amount of revenue recognition. The Company provides several
models for the procurement of its clinical, financial and administrative information systems. The
predominant method is a perpetual software license agreement, project-related installation
services, implementation and consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software and
software support. For those arrangements involving the use of services, the Company uses the
percentage of completion method of accounting, following the guidance in the AICPA Statement of
Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1),

Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts,

as prescribed by 97-2.

The Company provides installation services, which include project-scoping services, conducting
pre-installation audits and creating initial environments. Because installation services are
deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software, software license and installation



N

otes to Consolidated Financial Statements

services fees are recognized over the software installation period using output measures which
reflect direct labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at completion
of installation, typically a three-to-nine month process.

The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include consulting
activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services. These services
vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may
include additional database consulting, system configuration, project management, testing
assistance, network consulting, post conversion review and application management services.
Implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed to be essential to the
functionality of the software, and thus do not impact the timing of the software license
recognition, unless software license fees are tied to implementation milestones. In those
instances, the portion of the software license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred
until the related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non-forfeitable.
Implementation fees are recognized over the service period, which may extend from nine months to
three years for multi-phased projects.

Managed services are marketed under long-term arrangements generally over periods of five to 10
years. These services typically include a perpetual license for software that the client has
elected the Company to host in its data center. Vendor-specific objective evidence for hosting and
outsourcing services are established through renewal rates in the arrangements. The Company
accounts for revenues from these arrangements as the services are performed in accordance with EITF
Issue No. 00-3, Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the
Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware.

The Company also offers its solutions on an application service provider (“ASP”) or a term license
basis, making available Company software functionality on a remote processing basis from the
Company’s data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative support as well as
processing services. Revenue on software and services provided on an ASP or term license basis is
recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract. The Company capitalizes related
direct costs consisting of third-party costs and direct software installation and implementation
costs. These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.

Software support fees are marketed under annual and multi-year arrangements and are recognized as
revenue ratably over the contracted support term. Hardware maintenance revenues are billed and
recognized monthly over the contracted maintenance term.

Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the contracted terms.

Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized when title passes to the client.

Where the Company has contractually agreed to develop new or customized software code for a client
as a single element arrangement, the Company utilizes percentage of completion accounting in
accordance with SOP 81-1. If a contract includes multiple elements, including one or more
undelivered element, or if the agreement includes contingent revenue (as defined in EITF 00-21),
the Company complies with the provisions of EITF 00-21 and delays revenue recognition until
undelivered elements are delivered and revenue contingencies expire. When revenue is deferred all
direct and incremental costs associated with the arrangement are capitalized and amortized over the
contractual term once revenue recognition commences.

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, support, maintenance and other
services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed.
Long-term deferred revenue at January 1, 2005, represents amounts received from



N

otes to Consolidated Financial Statements

license fees, maintenance and other services to be earned or provided beginning in periods on or
after January 1, 2006.

The Company incurs out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its client service activities,
primarily travel, which are reimbursed by its clients. The amounts of ”out-of-pocket” expenses and
equal amounts of related reimbursements were $32,081,000, $30,443,000 and $28,410,000 for the years
ended January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, respectively.

The Company’s arrangements with clients typically include a deposit due upon contract signing and
date-based licensed software payment terms and payments based upon delivery for services, hardware
and sublicensed software. The Company has periodically provided long-term financing options to
creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has on occasion directly
provided extended payment terms from contract date. Certain of these receivables have been
assigned on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The Company accounts for
the assignment of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement No. 140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.
Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company recognizes revenue for
these arrangements under its normal revenue recognition criteria, net of any payment discounts from
financing transactions.

The terms of the Company’s software license agreements with its clients generally provide for a
limited indemnification of such intellectual property against losses, expenses and liabilities
arising from third-party claims based on alleged infringement by the Company’s solutions of an
intellectual property right of such third party. The terms of such indemnification often limit the
scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace
or modify an infringing solution. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its clients
for any losses related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to third-party intellectual
property infringement claims. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification
claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of
the corresponding agreements with its clients, the Company cannot determine the maximum amount of
potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions.

(d)

Fiscal Year

- The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal
year 2003 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2004 and 2002 consisted of 52 weeks each. All
references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years
unless otherwise noted.

(e)

Software Development Costs

- Costs incurred internally in creating computer software products
are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed
program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently
reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized
based on current and expected future revenue for each product with minimum annual amortization
equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the product. The
Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
capitalized $58,912,000, $58,736,000 and $49,984,000, respectively, of total software development
costs of $188,264,000, $179,999,000 and $149,985,000, respectively. Amortization expense of
capitalized software development costs in 2004, 2003 and 2002, was $42,237,000, $34,973,000 and
$29,619,000, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $207,382,000, $165,145,000 and
$130,172,000, respectively.

(f)

Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of short-term marketable securities with
original maturities less than ninety days.

(g)

Inventory

- Inventory consists primarily of computer hardware and sub-licensed software held
for resale and is recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.



N

otes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(h)

Property and Equipment

- Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over periods of 3
to 50 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using a straight-line method over
the lease terms, which range from periods of two to fifteen years.

(i)

Earnings per Common Share

– Basic earnings per share (EPS) excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. A
reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share
computations is as follows:

prices ranging from $45.00 to $273.72, $32.50 to $574.82 and $43.13 to $574.82, were outstanding at
the end of 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of
the common shares for the period.

(j)

Foreign Currency

- Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is
the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. The net
exchange differences resulting from these translations are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain (loss) resulting from foreign currency
transactions was ($479,000), $1,376,000 and $1,955,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



N

otes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(k)

Income Taxes

- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

(l)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets –

The Company accounts for goodwill under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no
longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment
indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test
based on fair value. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of its
fiscal year. There was no impairment of goodwill in 2004 and 2003. The Company used a discounted

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Concentrations

– Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments, are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Company’s
cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable
securities, and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and,
therefore, bear minimal risk.

Substantially all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks, hospitals, and other
healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to impact
these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access to
certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The
inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future
results.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally does not require
collateral from its clients. The Company maintains an allowance for potential losses based on
specific identification, historical experience and management’s judgments. The Company’s allowance
for doubtful accounts as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 was $17,583,000 and $12,056,000,
respectively.

(o)

Accounting for Stock Options —

The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, ”Accounting
for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25,”
issued in March 2000, to account for its fixed–plan stock options. Under this method for fixed
awards, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of
the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” established accounting and disclosure requirements
using a fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As
allowed by SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based
method of accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
123. The following is a reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings had the
Company recorded compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock
options under SFAS 123 for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Pro forma net earnings reflect only options granted since January 1, 1995. Therefore, the
full impact of calculating compensation expense for stock options under FAS 123 is not reflected in
the pro forma net earnings amounts presented above, because compensation cost is reflected over the
options’ vesting period of 10 years for these options. Compensation expense for options granted
prior to January 1, 1995 is not considered.

Reclassifications –

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the

Accounting for Variable Interest Entities

- On September 27, 2003, the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”) as amended by FIN 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an Interpretation of APB No. 51.” The Interpretation
provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means
other than through voting rights (“variable interest entities’” or “VIEs”) and how to determine
when and which business enterprises should consolidate the VIE (the “primary beneficiary”).

2 Business Acquisitions and Divestiture

During the three years ended January 1, 2005, the Company completed five acquisitions, which were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented and will not be presented for any of the acquisitions because the effects of these acquisitions were not
material to the Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The results of operations of
each acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations from the date
of each acquisition.

On March 15, 2004 the Company sold the referential content portion of Zynx Health Incorporated
(Zynx) for $12 million. The Company retained the life sciences portion of the business, which is
engaged in selling life sciences data to pharmaceutical companies for use in research, and the
Company retained the rights to use the Zynx content in its solutions going forward. The sale of
Zynx resulted in a gain of $1,826,000, net of $1,197,000 of tax, and has been included in Other
Income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

A summary of the Company’s purchase acquisitions for the three years ended January 1, 2005, is

(b) In March 2004 the Company amended the April 2002 purchase agreement with Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center (“Cedars”). The amendment requires the Company to pay at least $7.5 million in cash
to Cedars related to the original purchase of Zynx, which resulted in $7.5 million of additional
goodwill, along with up to $1 million in software discounts if Cedars chooses to license solutions
from the Company. At January 1, 2005 the Company had made payments of $2.5 million to Cedars. The
balance of the $7.5 million note will be payable on April 30, 2007.

process of determining its allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired. A Form
8-K, disclosing the completion of the acquisition of assets was filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on January 7, 2005, and an amended 8-K
reflecting pro forma financials will not be filed as explained above.

3 Receivables

Receivables consist of accounts receivable and contracts receivable. Accounts receivable represent
recorded revenues that have been billed. Contracts receivable represent recorded revenues that are
billable by the Company at future dates under the terms of a contract with a client. Billings and
other consideration received on contracts in excess of related revenues recognized are recorded as
deferred revenue. A summary of receivables is as follows:

5 Indebtedness

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in
three equal installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000
principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in 4 equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The
proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for
general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge
coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur
liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January
1, 2005.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement provides for a current revolving
line of credit for working capital purposes. The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and
requires monthly payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate
based on prime (5.25% at January 1, 2005) or LIBOR (2.4% at January 1, 2005) plus 2%. The interest
rate may be reduced by up to 1.15% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement
contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends. A
commitment fee of 3/10% to 1/2% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of
credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31, 2007. At January 1, 2005, the Company had
no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital
purposes. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its revolving line of credit
in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of VitalWorks, Inc. (See Note
2 to the consolidated financial statements.)

In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in
five equal annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a
$40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments beginning April
2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the
remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position.
The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants
and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and
pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 1, 2005.

In March 2004, the Company issued a $7,500,000 promissory note to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of
which $2,500,000 was repaid in October 2004. The balance of the note will be payable on April 30,
2007.

The Company also has capital lease obligations amounting to $8,378,000, payable over the next four
years.

Included in Other Income (Expense) in 2002 were gains on sale of investments and impairments
on Investments as described below.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold its remaining 14,820,527 shares of WebMD for
$90,119,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $2,736,000, net of $1,572,000
in tax, as a result of the sale. Since the shares sold had a lower income tax basis, the sale
resulted in the transfer of approximately $29,638,000 of deferred tax liabilities to income taxes
payable in the second quarter of 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company made a cash
payment of tax in the amount of $31,200,000 related to the investment gain.

In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08
and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The warrants were scheduled to expire on
January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold 1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000.
Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a
result of the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the shares.

The Company had certain other minority equity investments in non-publicly traded securities. These
investments were generally carried at cost as the Company owned less than 20% of the voting equity
and did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. Based on
events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of
tax of $3,623,000, for the impairment of various investments of non-publicly traded securities.
The charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Company’s investment
in Protocare, Inc., a non-publicly traded company.

7 Stock Options, Warrants and Equity

At the end of 2004 and 2003, the Company had 1,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued preferred
stock, $.01 par value.

8 Associate Stock Purchase Plan

The Company established an Associate Stock Purchase Plan (ASPP) in 2001, which qualifies under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. All full-time associates are eligible to participate.
Participants may elect to make contributions from 1% to 20% of compensation to the ASPP, subject to
annual limitations determined by the Internal Revenue Service. Participants may purchase Company
Common Stock at a 15% discount on the last day of the purchase period. Under APB No. 25 the ASPP
qualifies as a non-compensatory plan and no compensation expense has been recognized. The purchase
of the Company’s common stock is made through the ASPP on the open market and subsequently reissued
to the associates.

9 Foundations Retirement Plan

The Cerner Corporation Foundations Retirement Plan (the Plan) is established under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code. All full-time associates are eligible to participate. Participants
may elect to make pretax contributions from 1% to 80% of compensation to the Plan, subject to
annual limitations determined by the Internal Revenue Service. Participants may direct
contributions into mutual funds, a money market fund, or a Company stock fund. The Company makes
matching contributions to the Plan, on behalf of participants, in an amount equal to 33% of the
first 6% of the participant’s contribution. The Company’s expense for the plan amounted to
$5,994,000, $5,325,000 and $4,347,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



N

otes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company added a discretionary match to the Plan in 2000. Contributions are based on attainment
of established earnings per share goals for the year. Only participants in the Plan are eligible
to receive the discretionary match contribution. For the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 the
Company expensed $5,186,000, $0 and $5,345,000 for discretionary distributions, respectively.

Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income
over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, as well as the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize
the benefit of these deductible differences. At January 1, 2005, the Company has net operating
loss carryforwards subject to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code for Federal income tax
purposes of $20.9 million which are available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any,
through 2024.

Income taxes payable are reduced by the tax benefit resulting from disqualifying dispositions
of stock acquired under the Company’s stock option plans. The 2004, 2003, and 2002 benefits of
$9,191,000, $1,876,000, and $1,561,000, respectively, are treated as increases to additional
paid-in capital.

11 Related Party Transactions

The Company has made loans to the Company’s senior management under the terms of the Executive
Stock Purchase Program (“Program”). The purpose of the Program is to advance the interests of the
Company, the Company’s senior management, and the Company’s shareholders by offering the Company’s
senior management an incentive to purchase shares of the Company’s stock on the open market.
Pursuant to the Program, the Company provided Program loans to executives to help finance up to 50%
of the total purchase price of the stock purchased. All Program loans have a term of five (5)
years, at an interest rate of 5.5%. Principal and interest is not due until the end of the
five-year loan term, unless the executive terminates employment. Executives may also elect to pay
interest annually. If interest is not paid annually, it will compound annually. All Program loans
are full recourse to senior management including the purchased shares and any pledged shares. The
balance of these loans, including accrued interest, at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 was
$30,000 and $1,710,000, respectively. Loans to the Company’s senior executives are no longer
permitted under this program.

The Company leases an airplane from a company owned by Mr. Neal L. Patterson and Mr. Clifford W.
Illig. The airplane is leased on a per mile basis with no minimum usage guarantee. The lease rate
is believed to approximate fair market value for this type of aircraft. During 2004 and 2003,
respectively, the Company paid an aggregate of $574,000 and $839,000 for the rental of the
airplane. The airplane is used principally by the Company’s top executives to make client visits.

13 Segment Reporting

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information” establishes annual and interim reporting standards for operating segments
of a company. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services an entity
provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues, and its major
clients. In 2003, the Company organized geographically. The Company’s six geographic business
segments are: Great Lakes, Mid-America, North Atlantic, Southeast, West and Global. The Company
has not presented comparable information for 2002 as the necessary information is not available and
the cost to develop it would be excessive.

Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and administrative information
systems and solutions. The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services,
computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for
delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software
support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred by the geographic business
segments consist of sales and client service expenses including salaries of sales and client
service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Performance of the
segments is assessed at the operating earnings level and, therefore, the segment operations have
been presented as such. “Other” includes revenues not generated by the operating segments and
expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative and depreciation that
have not been allocated to the operating segments. The Company does not track assets by
geographical business segment.

Accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those used on a
consolidated basis. The following table presents a summary of the operating information for the
years ended January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004.

14 Accrued Vacation Pay Adjustment

In conjunction with a review of the process for calculating the liability for accrued vacation pay
at the end of the third quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the liability on the balance
sheet relating to periods prior to 2004 was understated by $3,346,000. While the Company was fully
accrued for all vested vacation that would be subject to payout upon termination, the Company
understated the liability for accumulated vacation that could be used in subsequent periods by
associates in excess of the vested amount payable upon termination.

The expense, if properly recorded in 2000 through 2003, would have increased 2003 net earnings by
$0.1 million and would have decreased net earnings by $0.4 million in 2002, $0.6 million in 2001,
and $1.2 million in 2000. The cumulative impact on net earnings is a decrease of $2.1 million for
this four-year period. The impact on 2004 net earnings is a positive $8 thousand. As the impact
to prior year’s annual financial statements was not material, Cerner recorded additional expense of
$3,346,000, $2,076,000 million after-tax, in the 2004 third quarter to appropriately reflect the
liability as of October 2, 2004. The Company has revised its process for calculating the liability
for accumulated vacation to accurately report this information in the future.
