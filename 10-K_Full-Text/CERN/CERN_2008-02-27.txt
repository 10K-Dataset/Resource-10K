Item 1. Business

Overview

Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the “Company”) is a Delaware business corporation formed in 1980.
The Company’s corporate headquarters are located at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City,
Missouri 64117. Its telephone number is 816.221.1024. The Company’s Web site address is
www.cerner.com. The Company makes available free of charge, on or through its Web site, its annual
report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all
amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically
filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cerner is a supplier of healthcare information technology (HIT) solutions, healthcare devices and
related services. Organizations ranging from single-doctor practices, to hospitals, to
corporations, to local, regional and national government agencies use

Cerner

®

solutions
and services to make healthcare safer, more efficient and of higher quality.

The Company’s software solutions have been designed and developed on the unified

Cerner
Millennium

®

architecture. This person-centric solution framework combines clinical,
financial and management information systems. It provides secure access to an individual’s
electronic medical record at the point of care and organizes and proactively delivers information
to meet the specific needs of the physician, nurse, laboratory technician, pharmacist or other care
provider, front- and back-office professionals and even consumers.

The Company’s

CareAware

™

device architecture is designed to bridge the gap between
medical devices and patient information by connecting information from various devices to the
clinician workflow and electronic medical record.

Cerner also offers a broad range of services, including implementation and training, remote
hosting, operational management services, support and maintenance, healthcare data analysis,
clinical process optimization, transaction processing for physician practices and employer health
plan third party administrator (TPA) services.

The Healthcare and Healthcare IT Industry

There are
several trends the Company believes create a positive market environment for HIT.

Healthcare spending continues to expand. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that,
if left unchecked, total spending on healthcare in the United States would rise from 16 percent of
the gross national product in 2007 to 25 percent in 2025. HIT is one of the few answers. A study by
RAND Corp. published in October 2005 found that widespread adoption of HIT could cut the total cost
of healthcare by about 10 percent.

Problems in the quality of healthcare also drive interest in HIT. In July 2007,

Health and Hospital
Networks

, a publication of the American Hospital Association, released its annual list of the
nation’s 100 Most Wired Hospitals and Health Systems. Survey results indicate the hospitals with
good quality results also are dedicated to HIT. These Most Wired Hospitals lead the nation in
electronic ordering and bedside medication matching to reduce the number of potential medication
errors. We believe these results provide incentive for more hospitals to adopt HIT.

Another factor we believe is favorable for the HIT industry in the United States is the continued
focus by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other payers on linking medical care
payments to quality and safety, an approach commonly referred to as “pay for performance.” Some pay
for performance plans offer additional reimbursement for healthcare providers that can demonstrate
high levels of quality and safety. Based on CMS’ final rule for changes to the 2008 inpatient
prospective payment system (IPPS), there will also be instances where providers are not paid for
treatment of conditions acquired while in the hospital if the condition is deemed reasonably
preventable through the application of evidence-based guidelines. This change, effective in October
2008, is positive for the HIT industry because ensuring compliance with evidence-based guidelines
is easier for organizations with an HIT system. Additionally, an expected increase in the number of
Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) that are used to determine how much providers are reimbursed for
providing care will also contribute to the need for HIT systems that can be used to more
efficiently and accurately document and accurately submit care for reimbursement.


As the United States enters the 2008 presidential election year, rising costs and varying quality
have solidified healthcare as a tier-one issue. Presidential candidates in both parties favor using
HIT to create efficiencies in the system and address the underlying issue of chronic illness. While
there is bipartisan recognition of the benefits of HIT, we do not foresee a scenario in which the
United States government would invest a significant amount of money directly in HIT, and we cannot
predict how healthcare will be impacted by the upcoming election.

Increasing healthcare spending and challenges in the quality and efficiencies of care are not
isolated to the United States. Most other countries are experiencing similar trends, a fact that
creates a favorable environment internationally for HIT solutions and related services.

Reflective
of these favorable national and global trends, the HIT market remains very competitive. The
market could be impacted by factors such as changes in reimbursement rates to hospitals and
physicians, a slowdown in adoption of HIT and changes in the political, economic and regulatory
environment.

Cerner Vision

Cerner’s vision has evolved from a fundamental thought: Healthcare should revolve around the
individual, not the encounter. This concept led to Cerner’s vision of a Community Health Model and
the creation of the unified

Cerner Millennium

architecture, the Company’s person-centric,
enterprise-wide architecture. The Community Health Model encompasses four steps:

Automate the Care Process

Cerner offers a longitudinal, person-centric electronic medical record, giving clinicians
electronic access to the right information at the right time and place to achieve the optimal
health outcome.

Connect the Person

Cerner is dedicated to building a personal health system. Medical information and care regimens
accessible from home empower consumers to effectively manage their conditions and adhere to
treatment plans, creating a new medium between physicians and individuals.

Structure the Knowledge

Cerner is dedicated to building systems that help bring the best science to every medical decision
by structuring, storing and studying the content surrounding each care episode to achieve optimal
clinical and financial outcomes.

Close the Loop

Incorporating a medical discovery into daily practice can take as long as 10 years. Cerner is
dedicated to building systems that implement evidence-based medicine, reducing the average time
from the discovery of an improved method to the change in the standard of care.

As more elements of this vision continue to evolve, Cerner expects medicine will become
increasingly personalized and technology more accessible. As such, Cerner’s vision has evolved to
include services that help large user communities:

•

Connect all stakeholders in the healthcare system, including payers (employers,
government), providers, and consumers

•

Remove clinical, financial and administrative friction

•

Create a secure, transparent, open network for data sharing to improve disease
management and facilitate personalized medicine

Achieving this vision will require continued leverage of the

Cerner Millennium

architecture and
ongoing expansion of our solutions and services, as discussed below under “Cerner Strategy and
Execution.”

Cerner Strategy and Execution

Key elements of the Company’s business strategy include:

•

Leverage the unified

Cerner Millennium

architecture and the depth and breadth of

Cerner

solutions to continue expanding market share

•

Increase penetration of both large health systems and independent hospitals

•

Cross-sell additional

Cerner

solutions and services to our existing client base


To execute upon many of the strategy elements listed above, we intend to continue developing
innovative solutions and services that leverage the Company’s technology and human capital
expertise and drive continued organic revenue growth, such as:

We also remain focused on offering more efficient and predictable implementations and systems that
can be operated at lower costs to reduce total cost of ownership for our clients. We are
accomplishing this through:

•

Bedrock

®

technology, which automates the implementation and management of the

Cerner Millennium

information platform.

•

CernerWorks

SM

managed services, which allow Cerner to manage complexity and
technology risks for clients through remote hosting while providing increased availability,
system security and predictable, lower cost of operations.

•

Our

MethodM

®

implementation approach, which is our best practice methodology
for working with clients to deliver value through implementation of

Cerner Millennium

solutions.

•

Our

Lights On Network

SM

surveillance system that identifies system
performance issues in real time and has the ability to predict issues that could create
system vulnerability. In the future, we plan for the

Lights On Network

system to include
real-time clinical and revenue cycle dashboards and ultimately create a real-time,
evidence-based network.

In summary, our business strategy is to deliver the optimal client experience and to pursue and
deliver continued innovation that will allow our important relationships with existing clients to
continue growing while also creating opportunities to establish new client relationships.

Software Development

Cerner continues to build upon the success of the

Cerner Millennium

2007 software release that
became generally available in late 2006. Our client base has been rapidly adopting the release, and
based on feedback from clients, Cerner decided to leverage the

Cerner Millennium

2007 platform for
all future innovations and enhancements through the end of the decade. Understanding the effort
involved with major release upgrades and the impact on our clients, this strategy will allow
clients already using

Cerner Millennium

2007 to take advantage of new enhancements and
functionality without requiring a major code upgrade.


We commit significant resources to developing new health information system solutions. As of
December 29, 2007, approximately 2,600 associates were engaged in research and development
activities. Total expenditures for the development and enhancement of our software solutions and

RxStation

medication dispensing devices were approximately $283,086,000, $262,163,000 and
$225,606,000 during the 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years, respectively. These figures include both
capitalized and non-capitalized portions and exclude amounts amortized for financial reporting
purposes.

As discussed above, continued investment in research and development remains a core element of
Cerner’s strategy. This will include ongoing enhancement of our core solutions and development of
new solutions and services.

The Company is committed to maintaining open attributes in its system architecture to achieve
operability in a diverse set of technical and application environments. The Company strives to
design its systems to co-exist with disparate applications developed and supported by other
suppliers.

Sales and Marketing

The markets for

Cerner

HIT solutions, healthcare devices and services include integrated delivery
networks, physician groups and networks, managed care organizations, hospitals, medical centers,
free-standing reference laboratories, home health agencies, blood banks, imaging centers,
pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, employers and public health organizations. To date, a
substantial portion of system sales have been in clinical solutions in hospital-based provider
organizations. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is highly scalable. Organizations ranging from
several-doctor physician practices, to community hospitals, to complex integrated delivery
networks, to local, regional and national government agencies use our

Cerner Millennium

solutions.

We design all

Cerner Millennium

solutions to operate on HP or IBM platforms, allowing Cerner to be
price competitive across the full size and organizational structure range of healthcare providers.
The sale of a

Cerner

software health information system usually takes approximately nine to 18
months, from the time of initial contact to the signing of a contract.

Our
executive marketing management is located in our North Kansas City, Missouri headquarters,
while our client representatives are deployed across the United States and globally. In addition to
the U.S., the Company, through subsidiaries and joint ventures, has sales associates and/or offices
in Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, China (Hong
Kong), India, Ireland, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. Cerner’s consolidated revenues include non-U.S sales of $290,677,000,
$207,367,000 and $113,317,000 for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years, respectively.

The Company supports its sales force with technical personnel who perform demonstrations of

Cerner

solutions and services and assist clients in determining the proper hardware and software
configurations. The Company’s primary direct marketing strategy is to generate sales contacts from
its existing client base and through presentations at industry seminars and tradeshows. Cerner
markets the

PowerWorks

solutions, offered on a subscription basis, directly to the physician
practice market using telemarketing and through existing acute care clients that are looking to
extend

Cerner

solutions to affiliated physicians. Cerner attends a number of major tradeshows each
year and sponsors executive user conferences, which feature industry experts who address the HIT
needs of large healthcare organizations.

Client Services

Substantially all of

Cerner’s

HIT software solutions clients enter into software maintenance
agreements with us for support of their

Cerner

systems. In addition to immediate software support
in the event of problems, these agreements allow clients the use of new releases of the

Cerner

solutions covered by maintenance agreements. Each client has 24-hour access to the client support
team located at Cerner’s world headquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri and the Company’s
global support organization in England.

Most Cerner clients who buy hardware through Cerner also enter into hardware maintenance agreements
with Cerner. These arrangements normally provide for a fixed monthly fee for specified services. In
the majority of cases, Cerner subcontracts hardware maintenance to the hardware manufacturer.
Cerner also offers a set of managed services that include remote hosting, operational management
services and disaster recovery.


Backlog

At December 29, 2007, Cerner had a contract backlog of approximately $2,712,195,000 as compared to
approximately $2,194,460,000 at December 30, 2006. Such backlog represents system sales and
services from signed contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. At December 29, 2007,
the Company had approximately $129,604,000 of contracts receivable compared to $132,748,000 at the
end of 2006, which represents revenues recognized but not yet billable under the terms of the
contract. At December 29, 2007, Cerner had a software support and maintenance backlog of
approximately $541,095,000 as compared to approximately $469,473,000 at December 30, 2006. Such
backlog represents contracted software support and hardware maintenance services for a period of 12
months. The Company estimates that approximately 39 percent of the aggregate backlog at December
29, 2007 of $3,253,290,000 will be recognized as revenue during 2008.

Competition

The market for HIT solutions, devices and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and
subject to rapid technological change. Our principal existing competitors in the healthcare
solutions and services market include: Computer Programs and Systems, Inc., Eclipsys Corporation,
Epic Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare Technologies, iSoft Corporation, McKesson Corporation,
Medical Information Technology, Inc. (“Meditech”), Misys Healthcare Systems and Siemens Medical
Solutions Health Services Corporation, each of which offers a suite of software solutions that
compete with many of our software solutions and services. Other competitors focus on only a
portion of the market that Cerner addresses. For example, competitors such as Cap Gemini, Computer
Sciences Corp., Deloitte & Touche, IBM Corporation and Perot Systems offer HIT services that
compete directly with our consulting services. Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.,
athenahealth, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Inc., Emdeon Corporation and Quality Systems, Inc. offer
solutions to the physician practice market but do not currently have a significant presence in the
health systems and independent hospital market. We view our principal competitors in the
healthcare device market to include: Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation, Omnicell, Inc.
and Royal Philips Electronics; and we view our principal competitors in the healthcare transactions
market to include: Accenture, Emdeon Corporation, McKesson Corporation, ProxyMed, Inc. and The
TriZetto Group, Inc., with almost all of these competitors being substantially larger or having
more experience and market share than us in their respective market. In addition, we expect that
major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service
providers and system integrators, start-up companies, managed care companies and others
specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions, devices or
services. The pace of change in the HIT market is rapid and there are frequent new software
solution, device or service introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards and
requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth
and quality of solution and service offerings, the stability of the solution provider, the features
and capabilities of the information systems and devices, the ongoing support for the systems and
devices and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions and devices.

Number of Employees (“Associates”)

As of December 29, 2007, the Company employed 7,873 associates worldwide.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risks Related to Cerner Corporation


We may be subject to product-related liabilities.

Many of our software solutions, healthcare
devices or services (including life sciences/research services) provide data for use by healthcare
providers in providing care to patients. No claims have been brought against us to date regarding
injuries related to the use of our software solutions, healthcare devices or services (including
life sciences/research services), but such claims may be made in the future. Although we maintain
liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business, there can
be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future,
prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms,
if at all. A successful material claim brought against us, if uninsured or under-insured, could
materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties.

Our software solutions and healthcare
devices, particularly the

Cerner Millennium

versions, are very complex. As with complex software
solutions and devices offered by others, our software solutions and healthcare devices may contain
coding or other errors, especially when first introduced. Although we conduct extensive testing,
we have discovered errors in our software solutions and healthcare devices after their
introduction. Our software solutions and healthcare devices are intended for use in collecting and
displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users
of our software solutions and healthcare devices have a greater sensitivity to errors than the
market for software products and devices generally. Our client agreements typically provide
warranties concerning material errors and other matters. Failure of a client’s

Cerner

software
solutions and/or healthcare devices to meet these warranties could constitute a material breach
under the client agreement, allowing the client to terminate the agreement and possibly obtain a
refund and/or damages, or might require us to incur additional expense in order to make the
software solution or healthcare device meet these criteria. Our client agreements generally limit
our liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain
jurisdictions or circumstances. A successful material claim brought against us, if uninsured or
under-insured, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may experience interruption at our data centers or client support facilities.

We perform data
center and/or hosting services for certain clients, including the storage of critical patient and
administrative data. In addition, we provide support services to our clients through various
client support facilities. We have invested in many reliability features such as multiple power
feeds, multiple backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines, as well as technical and
physical security safeguards, and structured our operations to substantially reduce the likelihood
of disruptions. However, complete failure of all generators, impairment of all telecommunications
lines, severe damage (environmental, accidental, intentional or pandemic) to the buildings, the
equipment inside the buildings housing our data centers, the client data contained therein and/or
the personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and
negatively impact clients who depend on us for data center and system support services. Any
interruption in operations at our data centers and/or client support facilities could damage our
reputation, cause us to lose existing clients, hurt our ability to obtain new clients, result in
revenue loss, create potential liabilites for our clients and us and increase insurance and other
operating costs.

Our proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of
intellectual property rights of others, or may be infringed or misappropriated by others.

We rely
upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure
agreements, confidentiality agreements with third parties and technical measures to maintain the
confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information. We also rely on trademark and
copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. We
have initiated a patent program but currently have a limited patent portfolio in the United States
and abroad. Despite our protective measures and intellectual property rights, we may not be able
to adequately protect against copying, reverse-engineering, misappropriation, infringement or
unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property.

In addition, we could be subject to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims
as the number of competitors, patents and patent enforcement organizations in the HIT market
increases, the functionality of our software solutions and services expands, and we enter new
markets such as healthcare device innovation, healthcare transactions and life sciences. These
claims, even if not


meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If we become liable to third parties for infringing or
misappropriating their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial
damage award, develop alternative technology, obtain a license and/or cease using, selling,
licensing, implementing and supporting the solutions, devices and services that violate the
intellectual property rights.

We are subject to risks associated with our non-U.S. operations.

We market, sell and service our
solutions, devices and services globally. We have established offices around the world, including
in: the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. We will continue to expand
our non-U.S. operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect non-U.S.
sales and support channels. Our business is generally transacted in the local functional currency.
In some countries, our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local
partners. There is a risk that we may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, we
may not be able to maintain or increase non-U.S. market demand for our solutions, devices and
services.

Non-U.S. operations are subject to inherent risks, and our future results could be adversely
affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include, but are not limited
to:

Our failure to effectively hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could
unfavorably affect our performance.

We utilize derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Some of these instruments and contracts may
involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. For additional information about risk on financial instruments, see Item 7
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation under Market
Risk. Further, our financial results from non-U.S. operations may decrease if we fail to execute
or improperly hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations.

Our success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel.

To remain competitive in
our industries, we must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing,
consulting and technical personnel, including executives, consultants, programmers and systems
architects skilled in the HIT, healthcare devices, healthcare transactions and life sciences
industries and the technical environments in which our solutions, devices and services are needed.
Competition for such personnel in our industries is intense in both the United States and abroad.
Our failure to attract additional qualified personnel to meet our non-U.S. personnel needs could
have a material adverse effect on our prospects for long-term growth. Our success is dependent to
a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management, sales, marketing, consulting
and technical personnel. The unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact
to our business and results of


operations, and
could potentially inhibit development and delivery of our solutions, devices and services and
market share advances.

We rely significantly on third party suppliers.

We license or purchase intellectual property and
technology (such as software, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors,
and incorporate software, hardware, and/or content into or sell it in conjunction with our
solutions, devices and services, some of which are critical to the operation and delivery of our
solutions, devices and services. If any of the third party suppliers were to change product
offerings, significantly increase prices or terminate our licenses or supply contracts, we might
need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to
ensure continued performance of our solutions, devices and services. Such alternatives may not be
available on attractive terms, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual
property or technology provided by our existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing, purchasing or
maintaining the third party intellectual property or technology significantly increases, our gross
margin levels could significantly decrease. In addition, interruption in functionality of our
solutions, devices and services as a result of changes in third party suppliers could adversely
affect future sales of solutions, devices and services.

We intend to continue strategic business acquisitions which are subject to inherent risks.

In order
to expand our solutions, device offerings and services and grow our market and client base, we may
continue to seek and complete strategic business acquisitions that we believe are complementary to
our business. Acquisitions have inherent risks which may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including, but not limited to: 1)
failure to successfully integrate the business and financial operations, services, intellectual
property, solutions or personnel of the acquired business; 2) diversion of management’s attention
from other business concerns; 3) entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior
experience; 4) failure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets; 5) loss of clients
or key personnel of the acquired business; 6) incurrence of debt and/or assumption of known and
unknown liabilities; 7) write-off of software development costs, goodwill, client lists and
amortization of expenses related to intangible assets; 8) dilutive issuances of equity securities;
and, 9) accounting deficiencies that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the
acquisition of the acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial
reporting and the time and cost associated with remedying such deficiencies. If we fail to
successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with
respect to these acquisitions, we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the
amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses.

Risks Related to the Healthcare Information Technology, Healthcare Device and Healthcare
Transaction Industry

The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.

For
example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) continues to have
a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized
transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the
appropriate level of privacy of protected health information. These regulatory factors affect the
purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations. Federal and state legislatures
have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the
federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. These
programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower
reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants
operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing
investment decisions, including investments in our solutions and services.

Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with
greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price
reductions for our solutions and services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, our client
base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of
landing new client relationships becomes greater.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local, state and federal level.

We are subject
to a significant and wide-ranging number of regulations both within the U.S. and elsewhere, such
as, without


limitation, regulations in the areas of: healthcare fraud, e-prescribing, claims processing and
transmission, medical devices, the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability
standards.

Healthcare Fraud.

Federal and state governments continue to strengthen their positions and scrutiny
over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are
reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our healthcare provider
clients are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, prohibit
the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or arranging
for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or
state healthcare programs. Federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and
remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation
on our clients is difficult to predict. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance
with any applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be
applicable to us, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could
broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the
way in which they deal with us. If such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to us
and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to sanctions
or liability, including exclusion from government health programs, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

E-Prescribing.

The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing, electronic
routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law. States
have differing prescription format requirements, which we have programmed into our software. In
addition, in November 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations by
CMS related to “E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program” (“E-Prescribing Regulations”).
These E-Prescribing Regulations were mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003. The E-Prescribing Regulations set forth standards for the transmission
of electronic prescriptions. The final regulations adopted two standards effective January 2006.
A second and final set of required standards are to be published no later than April 1, 2008 and
implemented no later than April 1, 2009. These standards are detailed and significant, and cover
not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic
eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information. Our
efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these regulations could be
time-consuming and expensive.

Claims Transmissions.

Certain of our solutions assist our clients in submitting claims to payers,
which claims are governed by federal and state laws. Our solutions are capable of electronically
transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients’ payers for
approval and reimbursement. Federal law provides civil liability to any person that knowingly
submits a claim to a payer, including, for example, Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans,
seeking payment for any services or items that have not been provided to the patient. Federal law
may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. We have
policies and procedures in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete transmission
of claims, provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete.
The HIPAA security, privacy and transaction standards, as discussed below, also have a potentially
significant effect on our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and
provided in a way that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations.

Regulation of Medical Devices.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has
declared that certain of our solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“Act”) and amendments to the Act. As a consequence, we are
subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to those solutions that are actively
regulated. Other countries have similar regulations in place related to medical devices, that now
or may in the future apply to certain of our solutions. If other of our solutions are deemed to be
actively regulated medical devices by the FDA or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we
do business, we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing
requirements including pre-market notification clearance. Complying with these medical device
regulations on a global perspective is time consuming and expensive. Further, it is possible that
these regulatory agencies may become more active in regulating software that is used in healthcare.


There have been nine FDA inspections since 1998 at various Cerner sites. Inspections conducted at
our world headquarters in 1999 and our prior  Houston, Texas facility in 2002 each resulted in the issuance
of an FDA Form 483 that we responded to promptly. The FDA has taken no further action with respect
to either of the Form 483s that were issued in 1999 and 2002. The remaining seven FDA inspections,
including inspections at our world headquarters in 2006 and 2007, resulted in no issuance of a Form
483. We remain subject to periodic FDA inspections and we could be required to undertake
additional actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Our
failure to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our solutions.
The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and/or
criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Security and Privacy of Patient Information.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality
of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released. These
regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information
and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures. Regulations
currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often
unclear and difficult to apply.

HIPAA
regulations require national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and
the data elements used in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually
identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include healthcare
organizations such as our clients, were required to comply with the privacy standards by April
2003, the transaction regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As a
business associate of the covered entities, we, in most instances, must also ensure compliance with
the HIPAA regulations as it pertains to our clients.

We are unable to predict what interpretations of or changes to the regulations issued
pursuant to HIPAA, might be issued or made in the future or how those interpretations or changes
could affect our business or the costs of compliance with HIPAA. Evolving HIPAA-related laws or
regulations could restrict the ability of our clients to obtain, use or disseminate patient
information. This could adversely affect demand for our solutions if they are not re-designed in a
timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new interpretations or regulations that seek
to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our clients to execute new or
modified healthcare transactions. We may need to expend additional capital, software development
and other resources to modify our solutions and devices to address these evolving data security and
privacy issues.

Interoperability Standards

. Our clients are concerned with and often require that our software
solutions and healthcare devices be interoperable with other third party HIT suppliers. Market
forces or governmental/regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that
would apply to our solutions, and if our software solutions and/or healthcare devices are not
consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development
costs to conform. Currently, the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology
(CCHIT) is developing a comprehensive set of criteria for the functionality, interoperability and
security of various software modules in the HIT industry. Achieving CCHIT certification is
becoming a competitive requirement, resulting in increased software development and administrative
expense to conform to these requirements. If our software solutions and healthcare devices are not
consistent with emerging standards, our market position and sales could be impaired and we may have
to invest significantly in changes to our software solutions and healthcare devices.

We operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries, and our ability to successfully compete
and continue to grow our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to market changes and
changing technologies and to bring competitive new solutions, devices, features and services to
market in a timely fashion.

The market for healthcare information systems, healthcare devices,
healthcare transactions and life sciences consulting services are intensely competitive,
dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological and innovative changes. Development of new
proprietary technology or services is complex, entails significant time and expense and may not be


successful. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to introduce new solutions, devices or
services on schedule, or at all, nor can we guarantee that, despite extensive testing, errors will
not be found in our new solution releases, devices or services before or after commercial release,
which could result in solution, device or service delivery redevelopment costs and loss of, or
delay in, market acceptance.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the healthcare information market include: the
breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings, the stability of the solution
provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems and devices, the ongoing support
for the systems and devices and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software
solutions and devices. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product
development, marketing and other resources than us and some of our competitors offer software
solutions that we do not offer. Our principal existing competitors
are set forth above   Part 1, Item
1 Competition.

In addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, large information
technology consulting service providers and system integrators, start-up companies and others
specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions, devices or
services. We face strong competitors and often face downward price pressure. Additionally, the
pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new
software solution introductions, software solution enhancements, device introductions, device
enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, our success will
depend upon our ability to: maintain a competitive pricing model, keep pace with technological
change and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions,
devices and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance.
There are a limited number of hospitals and other healthcare providers in the U.S. HIT market. As
costs fall, technology improves, and market factors continue to compel investment by healthcare
organizations in solutions and services like ours, market saturation in the U.S. may change the
competitive landscape in favor of larger, more diversified competitors with greater scale.

Risks Related to Our Stock

Our quarterly operating results may vary which could adversely affect our stock price.

Our
quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods,
including, variations from guidance, expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly
operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes, demand for
our solutions, devices and services, the financial condition of our clients and potential clients,
our long sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycles for larger, more
complex and higher-priced systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this
report. As a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for our

Cerner Millennium

solutions, a large percentage of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger,
more complex and higher-priced systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and
involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the
client. Sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients’ internal budgets, procedures for
approving large capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, availability
of personnel resources and by actions taken by competitors. Delays in the expected sale,
installation or implementation of these large systems may have a significant impact on our
anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently our earnings, since a significant percentage of our
expenses are relatively fixed.

We recognize software revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount
of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon our and our clients’ abilities to meet project
milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract could
result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material
adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter.

Our revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and
greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of clients’ year-end efforts to
make all final capital expenditures for the then-current year.

Our sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter.

We use a “pipeline”
system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales
associates monitor


the status of all sales opportunities, such as the date when they estimate that a client will make
a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated
periodically to generate a sales pipeline. We compare this pipeline at various points in time to
evaluate trends in our business. This analysis provides guidance in business planning and
forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative. Our pipeline estimates
are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period
of time, partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into
contracts that can be very difficult to estimate. A negative variation in the expected conversion
rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts, or in the pipeline itself, could cause our plan or
forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business results. For example, a slowdown
in information technology spending, adverse economic conditions or a variety of other factors can
cause purchasing decisions to be delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled, which would reduce the
overall pipeline conversion rate in a particular period of time. Because a substantial portion of
our contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter, we may not be able to adjust our cost
structure quickly enough in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in our
pipeline conversion rate in any given fiscal quarter(s).

The trading price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market for our common stock may
experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including
actual or anticipated variations in operating results, rumors about our performance or solutions,
devices and services, changes in expectations of future financial performance or estimates of
securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client
relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a matter of policy, we do not generally comment
on our stock price or rumors.

Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the markets for software, healthcare and information
technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been
unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual
operating performance.

Our Directors have authority to issue preferred stock and our corporate governance documents
contain anti-takeover provisions.

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of
those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be
issued in the future.

In addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more
difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This
includes, but is not limited to, provisions that: provide for a classified board of directors,
prohibit shareholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of
shareholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that
prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested shareholder for a period
of three years from the date the person became an interested shareholder, unless certain conditions
are met, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.

Item 2. Properties

World Headquarters

Our world headquarters offices are located in a Company-owned office park in North Kansas City,
Missouri, containing approximately 992,877 gross square feet of useable space (the “Campus”),
inclusive of the new data center and clinic buildings described below. As of December 29, 2007, we
were using all of the useable space for our U.S. corporate headquarters operations.

In June 2007, the Company completed construction of the world headquarters Technology Center, a
135,161 square foot data center facility on the Campus. We deliver remote hosting, disaster
recovery and other services to our clients from this facility.

In February 2006, we completed construction on the Campus of a 13,136 square foot addition to the
2901 Rockcreek Parkway building to house Health

e

Clinic, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which provides
primary care medical services for our associates and their family members.

In 2004, we purchased approximately 12 acres of unimproved real estate adjacent to the Campus for
campus expansion. This land was purchased to provide a secondary entry into the Campus and to
provide for future building development as needed. The first phase of development was a roadway
extension and second entry point into the Campus. The second phase of development is the data
center facility described above. Future development of this land is undetermined at this time.

Other Properties

In February 2007, we entered into a long-term lease for 480,700 gross square feet of property
located in Kansas City, Missouri. This office space, known as the Innovation Campus, houses
associates from our intellectual property organizations. In April and August 2007, additional
space was added to this lease so that the Innovation Campus now consists of 828,740 square feet,
including the daycare facility listed below.

In July 2007, we entered into a lease for 36,800 gross square feet of property located in Kansas
City, MO, near the Innovation Campus, which is the home for our Innovation Kids Learning Center,
providing on-site daycare for Cerner associate families.

In June 2005, we purchased 263,512 gross square feet of property located in Kansas City, Missouri.
The office space, known as the Cerner Oaks Campus, houses associates from the

CernerWorks

group and
associates of Cerner’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health

e

Exchange.

We also own property located along the north riverbank of the Missouri River, approximately two
miles from the Campus. This property consists of a 96,318 gross square foot building and a
1,300-car parking garage. The building has been renovated for use as a corporate training, meeting
and event center for the Company and third parties. We have also made use of the parking garage to
meet overflow-parking demands on the Campus.

In February 2007, we acquired a lease for an additional office in Garden Grove, California, as part
of the Etreby Computer Company, Inc. acquisition.

As of the end of February 2008, the Company leased office space in: Birmingham, Alabama; Beverly
Hills and Garden Grove, California; Denver, Colorado; Overland Park, Kansas; Waltham,
Massachusetts; Bel Air, Maryland; Minneapolis and Rochester, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri;
Charlotte, North Carolina; Beaverton, Oregon; Blue Bell, Pennsylvania; and Vienna, Virginia. The
Company operates one of its data centers in leased space in Lee’s Summit, Missouri. Globally, the
Company also leases office space in: Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; Brussels, Belgium;

Bangalore, India; Dublin, Ireland; Kuala


Lumpur, Malaysia; Ngee Ann City, Singapore; Barcelona and Madrid, Spain; London and Slough,
England; and, Abu Dhabi and Dubai Internet City, United Arab Emirates.

In 2007, our Overland Park, Kansas office housing associates with our Cerner BeyondNow, Inc.
subsidiary was closed as we relocated many associates to the Innovation Campus and/or the necessary
business functions to other Company offices, and we entered into a new agreement for office space
in Overland Park, Kansas for operations related to Cerner’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerner
Innovation, Inc.

Also in 2007, our Sterling, Virginia office was closed as we relocated many associates and/or the
necessary business functions to other Company offices.

(1)

Includes share-based compensation expense recognized in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. The impact of including this
expense is a $10.2 million decrease, net of $6.0 million tax benefit, in net earnings
and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of $.12 in 2007 and a $11.7 million
decrease, net of $7.3 million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted
earnings per share of $.14 in 2006.

(2)

Includes a research and development write-off related to the

RxStation

medication dispensing devices. In connection with production and delivery of the

RxStation

medication dispensing devices, the Company reviewed the accounting treatment
for the

RxStation

line of devices and determined that $8.6 million of research and
development activities for the

RxStation

medication dispensing devices that should have
been expensed was incorrectly capitalized. The impact of this charge is a $5.4 million
decrease, net of $3.2 million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted
earnings per share of $.06 in the year ended December 29, 2007, $2.1 million of this
$5.4 million after tax amount recorded in 2007 related to periods prior to 2007.

(3)

Includes a $3.1 million tax benefit recorded in 2007 related to periods prior
to 2007. The tax benefit relates to the over-expensing of state income taxes, which
resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per share of $.04 in the year ended
December 29, 2007.

(4)

Includes an adjustment to correct the amounts previously reported for the
second quarter of 2007 for a previously disclosed out-of-period tax item relating to
foreign net operating losses. The effect of this adjustment increases tax expense for
the year ended December 29, 2007, by $4.2 million and increases January 1, 2005
retained earnings (Shareholders’ Equity) by the same amount.


(5)

Includes a tax benefit of $2.0 million for adjustments relating to prior
periods. This results in an increase to diluted earnings per share of $.02.

(6)

Includes a tax benefit of $4.8 million relating to the carry-back of a capital
loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated (“Zynx”) in the first quarter of
2004. The impact of this refund claim is a $4.8 million increase in net earnings and
an increase in diluted earnings per share of $.06 for 2005.

(7)

Includes a charge for the write-off of acquired in process research and
development related to the acquisition of the medical business division of VitalWorks,
Inc. The impact of this charge is a $3.9 million decrease, net of $2.4 million tax
benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of $.05 for 2005.

administrative. The impact of this charge is a $2.1 million decrease, net of $1.2
million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of
$.03 for 2004.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand
the results of operations and financial condition of Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the
“Company”). This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our
financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).

Management Overview

Cerner primarily derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions,
clinical content, hardware, healthcare devices and services that give healthcare providers secure
access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the
quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. We implement the healthcare
solutions as stand-alone, combined or enterprise-wide systems.

Cerner Millennium

software solutions
can be managed by the Company’s clients or in the Company’s data center via a managed services
model.

Our fundamental strategy has always centered on creating organic growth by investing in research
and development (R&D) to create solutions and services for the healthcare industry. This strategy
has driven strong growth over the long-term, with revenue growing at compound annual rates of more
than 14% over the past three-, five- and ten-year periods. This growth has also created a very
strategic client base of more than 6,000 hospital, health system, physician practice, clinic,
laboratory and pharmacy client sites around the world. Selling additional solutions back into this
client base is an important element of Cerner’s future revenue growth. We are also focused on
driving growth through market share expansion by replacing competitors in healthcare settings that
are looking to replace their current HIT suppliers or by creating new business relationships with
those healthcare organizations that have not yet strategically aligned with a supplier. We also
expect to drive growth through new initiatives that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate such as
our

CareAware

healthcare device architecture and devices, Health

e

employer services, physician
practice solutions and solutions and services for the pharmaceutical market. Finally, we expect
continued strong revenue contributions from the sale of our solutions and services outside of the
U.S. Many non-U.S. markets have a low penetration of HIT solutions and their governing bodies are
in many cases prepared to purchase HIT solutions and services.

Beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth, we are also focused on earnings growth. Our net
earnings have increased at more than 20% compound annual rates over three-, five- and ten-year
periods. We believe we can continue driving strong levels of earnings growth by leveraging key
areas to create operating margin expansion. The primary areas of opportunity for margin expansion
include:


•

becoming more efficient at implementing our software by leveraging implementation
support services and methodologies we have developed that can reduce the amount of effort
required to implement our software;

•

leveraging our investments in R&D by addressing new markets (i.e., non-U.S.) that do not
require significant incremental R&D but can contribute significantly to revenue growth;
and,

•

leveraging our scalable business infrastructure to reduce the rate of increase in
general and administrative spending to below our revenue growth rate.

We are also focused on increasing cash flow by growing earnings, reducing the use of working
capital and controlling capital expenditures. While 2007 was a year of heavy capital investment
because of investments in a new data center to support our rapidly growing hosting business and
purchasing new buildings to accommodate growth in our associate base, we expect capital spending to
decrease in 2008.

Results Overview

In 2007, we continued to execute on our core strategies to drive revenue growth, expand operating
margins, grow earnings and generate good cash flow. The 2007 results included strong levels of
bookings, earnings and cash flow. New business bookings revenue in 2007, which reflects the value
of executed contracts for software, hardware, services and managed services (hosting of software in
the Company’s data center) was $1.51 billion, which is an increase of 14% when compared to $1.32
billion in 2006. The 2007 and 2006 bookings exclude bookings related to the Company’s
participation in the National Health Services (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and
digitize medical records in England in the amount of $97.8 million and $154.2 million,
respectively. Revenues for 2007 increased 10% to $1.52 billion compared to $1.38 billion in 2006,
driven primarily by an increase in support, maintenance and services revenues.

The 2007 net earnings increased 16% to $127.1 million compared to $109.9 million in 2006. Diluted
earnings per share increased 14% to $1.53 compared to $1.34 in 2006. The 2007 and 2006 net
earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of accounting pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” which requires the expensing
of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced the 2007 net earnings and
diluted earnings per share by $10.2 million and $0.12, and the 2006 earnings and diluted earnings
per share by $11.7 million and $0.14, respectively. The growth in net earnings and diluted
earnings per share was driven primarily by continued progress with the Company’s margin expansion
initiatives, particularly improving professional services margins and leveraging R&D investments.
Our 2007 operating margin was 13%, and we remain on target with our desire to achieve our long term
goal of 20% operating margins.

We had cash collections of receivables of $1.65 billion in 2007 compared to $1.46 billion in 2006,
with the increase driven by increased billings. Days sales outstanding increased to 90 days for
the quarter ended December 29, 2007 compared to 87 days for the quarter ended December 30, 2006.
This increase was driven by an increase in billed receivables as opposed to unbilled items.
Operating cash flows for 2007 were $274.6 million compared to $232.7 million in 2006.

This year also included progress on our strategic initiatives that, while not yet material to our
current results, are an important part of our longer-term growth strategy.

In 2007, we made progress in selling and implementing our

CareAware

healthcare device connectivity
platform that allows medical devices to be connected to an electronic medical record through a
USB-like connection. During 2007, more than 20 clients purchased this solution, with several going
live during the year. Initial sales have been to our existing clients, but our

CareAware

architecture gives us the ability to market outside of our installed base, which we expect to do in
the future. In 2008, we also expect to continue expanding the number of devices supported by the

CareAware

architecture, which will increase our market opportunity.

We also delivered our first production

CareAware RxStation

medication dispensing devices in 2007.

RxStation

medication dispensing devices and solutions automate the medication process so both
nursing and pharmacy can provide safer care and better management of the medication dispensing and


administration process. In 2008, we expect to leverage our success with early adopter clients and
increase marketing of the

RxStation

devices, with initial efforts focused inside our installed
base.

In 2007, we also continued to make progress across our employer-focused initiatives that we call
Health

e

employer services, which are targeted at employers looking to reduce health plan
administrative costs and improve the health of their employees. In 2007, Cerner’s Health

e

Exchange
became the third party administrator (TPA) for three employers representing more than 10,000
covered lives. Our TPA approach aims to help employers reduce healthcare friction, such as delays
in billing statements and provider payments, resulting in lower costs. And our Health

e

Clinic was
selected by a Fortune 500 technology company to provide a fully-automated employer-based clinic,
modeled after our successful on-site clinic that has helped improve productivity of our workforce
and provided cost savings to our health plan and the participants in the health plan.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 29, 2007, Compared to Year Ended December 30, 2006

The Company’s net earnings increased 16% to $127,125,000 in 2007 from $109,891,000 in 2006. The
effects of SFAS No. 123R, which requires the expensing of stock options, decreased net earnings in
2007 and 2006 by $10,159,000, net of $6,030,000 tax benefit and $11,746,000, net of $7,275,000 tax
benefit, respectively.

Revenues increased 10% to $1,519,877,000 in 2007, compared with $1,378,038,000 in 2006. The
revenue composition for 2007 was $500,319,000 in system sales, $397,713,000 in support and
maintenance, $585,067,000 in services and $36,778,000 in reimbursed travel.

•

System sales revenues decreased 1% to $500,319,000 in 2007 from $505,743,000 in 2006.
Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware, sublicensed
software, deployment period licensed software upgrade rights, installation fees,
transaction processing and subscriptions. The slight decrease in system sales was
primarily attributable to a decrease in software revenue, which was largely offset by an
increase in hardware, sublicensed software, and subscriptions revenue. We believe the
decline in software revenue was primarily caused by much of our client base being focused
on upgrading to the

Cerner Millennium

2007 release. Cerner generally sells a perpetual
license, so our clients do not have to pay new license fees when they upgrade to a new
version of our software, so the focus by much of our base on implementing the upgrade
impacted our software sales. We believe this upgrade cycle will have a smaller impact
going forward, and we expect software revenue to grow in 2008.

•

Support, maintenance and services revenues increased 18% to $982,780,000 in 2007 from
$833,244,000 in 2006. Included in support, maintenance and services revenues are support
and maintenance of software and hardware, professional services excluding installation, and
managed services. A summary of the Company’s support, maintenance and services revenues in
2007 and 2006 is as follows:

continued success at selling

applications, implementing them at client
sites, and initiating billing for support and maintenance fees.

Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized
as revenue, increased 24% in 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by growth in
new business bookings during the past four quarters, including continued strong levels of
managed services bookings that typically have longer contract terms. A summary of the
Company’s total backlog for 2007 and 2006 follows:

The cost of revenues was 18% of total revenues in 2007 and 21% in 2006. The cost of revenues
includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, sales commissions, third party consulting services
and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from hardware and
software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance
and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Such costs, as a percent of
revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, maintenance, support,
services and reimbursed travel) carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The
decline in cost of revenues as a percent of revenue is primarily associated with lower commissions
and third party costs on licensed software sales and a higher mix of support, maintenance and
services revenues, which have a lower cost of revenue.

Total operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues, increased 12% to $1,035,684,000 in 2007 from
$920,901,000 in 2006. Accounting pursuant to SFAS 123(R), which results in the expensing of
share-based compensation, impacted expenses in 2007 and 2006 as indicated below:

$578,050,000 in 2006. Sales and client service expenses include salaries of sales and
client service personnel, communications expenses, unreimbursed travel expenses, expense
for share-based payments, sales and marketing salaries and trade show and advertising
costs. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in

CernerWorks

managed services
business.

•

Total expense for software development in 2007 increased 10% to $270,576,000, from
$246,970,000 in 2006. The increase in aggregate expenditures for software development in
2007 was due to continued development and enhancement of the

Cerner Millennium

platform and
software solutions and investments in new initiatives, such as

RxStation

medication
dispensing devices. Included in 2007 software development expense is $8.6 million of
research and development activities for the

RxStation

medical dispensing device. $3.4
million of this amount recorded in 2007 is related to periods prior to 2007. A summary of

General and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in 2007 and
2006. These expenses increased 12% to $107,152,000 in 2007 from $95,881,000 in 2006. This
increase was due primarily to the growth of the Company’s core business and increased
presence in the global market. General and administrative expenses include salaries for
corporate, financial and administrative staff, utilities, communications expenses,
professional fees, the transaction gains or losses on foreign currency and expense for
share-based payments. The Company recorded a net transaction gain on foreign currency of
$3,691,000 and $3,764,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net interest income was $1,269,000 in 2007, compared with net interest expense of $697,000 in 2006.
Interest income increased to $13,206,000 in 2007 from $11,877,000 in 2006, due primarily to higher
yields on cash and short term investments. Interest expense decreased to $11,937,000 in 2007 from
$12,574,000 in 2006, due primarily to a reduction in long-term debt.

Other expense was $1,385,000 in 2007, compared to other income of $2,074,000 in 2006. Included in
2006 other income is a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2006 related to the renegotiation of a
supplier contract that eliminated a liability related to unfavorable future commitments due to that
supplier. The Company was able to renegotiate the contract to eliminate certain minimum volume
requirements and reduce pricing to market rates leading to the elimination of the previously
recorded liability.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 38% and 34% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in tax
rate was principally related to the creation of a valuation allowance
in a non-U.S. jurisdiction in
2007.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company determined that due to a change in circumstances in
the quarter, it is more likely than not that certain tax operating loss carry-forwards in a non-U.S.
jurisdiction would not be realized resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance totaling
approximately $7,982,000.

Tax expense for 2007 and 2006 includes benefits of approximately $3,125,000 and $1,994,000,
respectively for adjustments relating to prior periods.

Domestic Segment

The Company’s Domestic segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures associated with
business activity in the United States.

Operating earnings increased 11% to $675,156,000 in 2007 from $607,003,000 in 2006.

•

Revenues increased 5% to $1,227,434,000 in 2007 from $1,166,662,000 in 2006. This
increase was primarily driven by growth in managed services and support and maintenance.

•

Cost of revenues was 18% and 22% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decline was driven
primarily by lower commissions and third party costs on licensed software sales, lower
hardware sales, and a higher mix of support, maintenance and services revenues, which have
a lower cost of revenue.

•

Operating expenses increased 7% for the year ended December 29, 2007, as compared to the
year ended December 30, 2006, due primarily to growth in managed services.

Global Segment

The
Company’s global segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures linked to business
activity in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, China (Hong Kong), Egypt,
England, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

Operating earnings increased 42% to $85,955,000 in 2007 from $60,572,000 in 2006.

•

Revenues increased 40% to $290,677,000 in 2007 from $207,367,000 in 2006. Approximately
one third of this increase was driven by an increase in revenue from the Company’s
participation in the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical
processes and digitize medical


records in England. The increase in global revenue was also driven by growth in several
other countries, including Malaysia, Australia, Egypt, France, Spain, and the United Arab
Emirates. Revenue related to the NHS initiative that is being accounted for at zero margin
totaled $96,000,000 and $71,000,000 for the 2007 and 2006 fiscal years, respectively. These
revenues did not affect operating earnings as the Company is accounting for them at
zero-margin using a zero-margin approach of applying percentage-of-completion accounting
until either the software customization and development services are completed or the
Company is able to determine fair value for the support services. The Company expects to
recognize margin on the arrangements by 2009. The remaining unrecognized portion of the fee
will be recognized over the remaining term of the arrangement, which expires in 2014.

•

Cost of revenues was 18% and 19% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The lower cost of
revenues was driven by a slightly higher mix of support, maintenance and services revenues,
which have a lower cost of revenue.

•

Operating expenses for the year ended December 29, 2007 increased 41%, compared to the
year ended December 30, 2006, primarily due to hiring personnel for the projects in England
and supporting growth in other global regions.

Other Segment

The Company’s Other segment includes revenues and expenses which are not tracked by geographic
segment. Operating losses increased 11% to $557,028,000 in 2007 from $501,408,000 in 2006. This
increase was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses such as software development,
marketing, general and administrative, share-based compensation expense and depreciation.

Year Ended December 30, 2006, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

The Company’s net earnings increased 27% to $109,891,000 in 2006 compared to $86,251,000 in 2005.
Net earnings for 2006 include adjustments for approximately $1,994,000 of tax benefit for items
relating to prior periods. 2006 net earnings also reflect the impact of accounting pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” which requires
the expensing of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced the 2006 net
earnings by $11,746,000 (net of taxes). Net earnings for 2005 included an adjustment in the third
quarter of 2005 related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry-back of a capital loss
generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,794,000 and the write-off of acquired in-process research and
development in the first quarter of 2005 of $3,941,000, net of a $2,441,000 tax benefit.

Revenues increased 19% to $1,378,038,000 in 2006 from $1,160,785,000 in 2005. The revenue
composition for 2006 was $505,743,000 in system sales, $340,416,000 in support and maintenance,
$492,828,000 in services and $39,051,000 in reimbursed travel.

•

System sales increased 12% to $505,743,000 in 2006 from $449,734,000 in 2005. Included
in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware, sublicensed software,
deployment period licensed software upgrade rights, installation fees, transaction
processing and subscriptions. System sales growth in 2006 was driven by strong growth of
software, hardware and subscriptions.

and 2005. Total general and administrative expenses were $95,881,000 and $81,620,000 for
2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase was due primarily to growth in the Company’s core
business and increased presence in the global market. General and administrative
expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities,
communications expenses, professional fees and the transaction gains or losses on foreign
currency. The Company had net transaction gains on foreign currency of $3,764,000 for 2006
compared to $2,700,000 for 2005.

•

2005 includes a write-off of in process research and development in the amount of $3,941,000, net of $2,441,000 tax benefit, related to the acquisition of the medical division of VitalWorks.

Net interest expense was $697,000 in 2006 compared to $5,858,000 in 2005. Interest income
increased to $11,877,000 in 2006 from $3,871,000 in 2005, due primarily to higher interest rates
and a higher cash balance. Interest expense increased to $12,574,000 in 2006 from $9,729,000 in
2005, due primarily to a higher level of debt during 2006.

Other income was $2,074,000 in 2006 compared to $666,000 in 2005. Included in other income is
income from office space leased to third parties. 2006 other income also includes a gain recorded
in the first quarter of 2006 related to the renegotiation of a supplier contract that eliminated a
liability related to unfavorable future commitments due to that supplier. The Company was able to
renegotiate the contract to eliminate certain minimum volume requirements and reduce pricing to
market rates leading to the elimination of the previously recorded liability. The increase in other
income in 2006 was driven by this gain and by higher lease income.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 34% and 36% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax expense for
2006 includes benefits of approximately $1,994,000 for adjustments relating to prior periods. Tax
expense for 2005 includes an adjustment that reduced tax expense related to a prior period for a
tax benefit from the carry-back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,749,000.
Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rates were 36% and 40% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Domestic Segment

The Company’s domestic segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures associated with
business activity in the United States.

Operating earnings increased 17% to $607,003,000 in 2006 from $517,610,000 in 2005.

•

Revenues increased 12% to $1,166,662,000 in 2006 from $1,043,804,000 in 2005. This
increase was primarily driven by growth in managed and professional services.

•

Cost of revenues was basically unchanged at 22% and 23% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

•

Operating expenses increased 7% for the year ended December 30, 2006, as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to growth in professional and managed services.


Global
Segment

The
Company’s global segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures linked to business
activity outside of the United States, which for 2006 and 2005 included: in Australia, Canada,
China (Hong Kong), England, France, Germany, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain and
the United Arab Emirates.

Operating earnings increased 26% to $60,572,000 in 2006 from $48,030,000 in 2005.

•

Revenues increased 83% to $207,367,000 in 2006 from $113,317,000 in 2005. This increase
was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from the Company’s participation in the
National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize
medical records in England. Revenue related to the NHS initiative that is being accounted
for at zero-margin totaled $69,000,000 and $14,000,000 for the, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years,
respectively. These revenues did not affect operating earnings as the Company is
accounting for them at zero-margin using a zero-margin approach of applying
percentage-of-completion accounting until either the software customization and development
services are completed or the Company is able to determine fair value for the support
services. The Company expects to recognize margin on the arrangements by 2009. The
remaining unrecognized portion of the fee will be recognized over the remaining term of the
arrangement, which expires in 2014.

•

Cost of revenues was 19% and 15% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in costs
of revenues as a percent of total revenues was driven by a much
higher level of global
hardware sales in 2006 compared to 2005.

•

Operating expenses for the year ended December 30, 2006 increased 124%, compared to the
year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to hiring personnel for the projects in England
and supporting growth in other global regions.

Other Segment

The Company’s Other segment includes revenues and expenses which are not tracked by geographic
segment.

Operating losses increased 18% to $501,408,000 in 2006 from $425,204,000 in 2005. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in operating expenses such as software development, marketing, general
and administrative, share-based compensation expense and depreciation. Operating expenses in the
2005 period includes the write-off of acquired in-process research and development of $6,382,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the
Company’s revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in
software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is its cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government
Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements.
At December 29, 2007 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $182,914,000, short-term
investments of $161,600,000 and working capital of $530,441,000 compared to cash and cash
equivalents of $162,545,000, short-term investments of $146,239,000 and working capital of
$444,656,000 at December 30, 2006.

At December 29, 2007, we held approximately $162 million of auction rate securities, classified as
short-term investments, with an auction reset feature (“auction rate securities”) whose underlying
assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by various state governments.
There were successful auctions for all of the securities held at December 29, 2007. At February
14, 2008, we held approximately $122 million of auction rate securities. In February 2008, auctions
failed for $36 million


of our auction rate securities, and there is no assurance that currently
successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue
to succeed, and as a result, our ability to
liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term
may be limited or not exist. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities
could not. All of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failure, are
currently rated AAA the highest rating, by a rating agency. If the issuers are unable to
successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be
required to record an impairment charge on these investments. We believe we will be able to
liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year, and we currently believe
these securities are not significantly impaired, primarily due to the government guarantees and AAA
ratings of the underlying securities, however, it could take until the final maturity of the
underlying notes (up to 30 years) to realize our investments’ recorded value. Based on our expected
operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of
liquidity on these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities

The Company generated cash of $274,565,000, $232,718,000 and $228,865,000 from operations in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2007 due primarily to a
stronger performance in net earnings. The Company has periodically provided long-term financing
options to creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has directly
provided extended payment terms to clients from contract date. These extended payment term
arrangements typically provide for date based payments over periods ranging from 12 months to seven
years. Pursuant to SOP 97-2, because a significant portion of the fee is due beyond one year, we
have analyzed our history with these types of arrangements and have concluded that we do have a
standard business practice of using extended payment term arrangements and have a long history of
successfully collecting under the original payment terms for arrangements with similar clients,
product offerings and economics without granting concessions. Accordingly, we consider the fee to
be fixed and determinable in these extended payment term arrangements and, thus, the timing of
revenue is not impacted by the existence of extended payments. Some of these payment streams have
been assigned on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The Company has
provided its usual and customary performance guarantees to the third party financing institutions
in connection with its on-going obligations under the client contract. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
the Company received total client cash collections of $1,646,584,000, $1,457,603,000 and
$1,200,595,000, respectively, of which approximately 5%, 7% and 7% were received from third party
client financing arrangements and non-recourse payment assignments, respectively. The days sales
outstanding increased to 90 days for the quarter ended December 29, 2007 compared to 87 days for
the quarter ended December 30, 2006. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements
represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 17% in 2007 and 15% in
2006, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems
grows.

Cash Flow from Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities in 2007 consisted primarily of capital purchases of $180,723,000,
which includes $105,678,000 of capital equipment and $75,045,000 of land, buildings and
improvements and business acquisitions totaling $24,061,000. Capitalized software development costs
were $66,063,000 in 2007. Cash paid for short-term investments, net of sales and maturities was
$13,277,000 in 2007. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 consisted primarily of capital
purchases of $131,478,000, which includes $70,299,000 of capital equipment and $61,179,000 of land,
buildings and improvements. Capitalized software development costs were $61,223,000 and the
acquisition of businesses totaled $13,731,000. Cash provided by sales and maturities of short-term
investments, net of purchases, was $29,122,000 in 2006.

In the second quarter of 2007, the Company completed the construction of a new data center on its
world headquarters campus in North Kansas City, Missouri. The Company spent approximately
$61,203,000 on this construction project. Of this amount, $34,345,000 was spent in 2006 and the
remaining amount was spent in 2007.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities


The Company’s 2007 financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of
options of $29,085,000, the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $30,357,000 and
repayment of long-term debt of $22,359,000. In 2006, the Company’s financing activities consisted
primarily of proceeds from the exercise of options of $21,704,000, the excess tax benefit from share-based
compensation of $7,068,000 and repayment of long-term debt of $30,783,000.

In December 2007, the Company had a one-day borrowing of $40,000,000 from its line of credit which
was repaid on the following day. This was in connection with tax incentives related to the World
Headquarters data center. The Company does not expect this to be necessary in future periods.

In November 2005, the Company completed a £65,000,000 ($129,779,000 at December 29, 2007) private
placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven
equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2007.

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in
three equal installments that commenced in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a
$39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning
December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Company’s credit
facility and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and
fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to
borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at December 29, 2007.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on
November 30, 2006, and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital
purposes. The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of
interest only. Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (7.25% at
December 29, 2007) or LIBOR (4.73% at December 29, 2007) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be
reduced by up to 1.15% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain
net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on
the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of
2/10% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line
of credit matures on May 31, 2010. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its
revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of
VitalWorks. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) This amount was paid in full
as of December 31, 2005. At December 29, 2007, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under
this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2007.

In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, were paid in
full in 2006. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable
in six equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire
the Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital
improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain
net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on
the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2007.

The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations
and, if necessary, its lines of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements
during 2008.


The following table represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial
commitments, excluding interest, as of December 29, 2007, except short-term purchase order
commitments arising in the ordinary course of business.

The effects of inflation on the Company’s business during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were not significant.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement establishes
a single authoritative definition of fair value when accounting rules require the use of fair
value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
fair value measurements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 157 on
its results of operations and its financial position and will be required to adopt SFAS 157 as of
the first day of the 2008 fiscal year. The effect of adopting SFAS 157 is not expected to be
material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS 159),
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This statement provides
companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 159 on its results of operations and
its financial position and will be required to adopt SFAS 159 as of the first day of the 2008
fiscal year. The effect of adopting SFAS 159 is not expected to be material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)) which replaces
SFAS 141 and supersedes FIN 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations
Accounted for by the Purchase Method”. SFAS 141(R) establishes guidelines for how an acquirer
measures and recognizes the identifiable assets, goodwill, noncontrolling interest, and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. Additionally, SFAS 141(R) outlines the disclosures necessary to
allow financial statement users to assess the impact of the acquisition. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 141(R) on its results of operations and its
financial position, which is expected to be immaterial, and will be required to adopt SFAS 141(R)
prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after the first day of the 2009 fiscal
year.

Also in
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 160 (SFAS 160),
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”, which amends ARB No. 51. SFAS 160
guides that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the
consolidated financial statements, and that net income should be reported at amounts that include
the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 160 on its results of operations, which is
expected to be immaterial, and its financial position and will be required to adopt SFAS 160 as of
the first day of the 2009 fiscal year.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding
the Company’s historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of
revenue and other significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. These
significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, potential
impairments of goodwill and income taxes. These policies and the Company’s procedures related to
these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this “Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In addition, Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the Company’s accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software-related
services, using the residual method under SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
SOP No. 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) 104 “Revenue Recognition”
and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). Key factors in the Company’s revenue recognition model are
management’s assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the
Company’s software whereas implementation services are not; and the length of time it takes for the
Company to achieve its delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software. If the
Company’s business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be
essential to the functionality of the


Company’s software, the period of time over which the
Company’s licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally
recognizes combined revenue from the sale of its licensed software and related installation
services over two key milestones, delivery and installation,
based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation. Generally,
both milestones are achieved in the quarter the contracts are executed. If the period of time to
achieve the Company’s delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to
lengthen, its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed
software could materially change.

The Company also recognizes revenue for certain projects using the percentage of completion method
pursuant to Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1), Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type
and Certain Production-Type Contracts

,

as prescribed by SOP 97-2. The Company’s revenue
recognition is dependent upon the Company’s ability to reliably estimate the direct labor hours to
complete a project. The Company utilizes its historical project experience as a basis for its
future estimates to complete current projects.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those
solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design, which is when the Company
determines that technological feasibility has been established. Thereafter, all software
development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are
available for general release, and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of
amortized cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross
future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing
and disposing of that product. Because the development of projected net future revenues related to
our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates, a
significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software
development costs. We historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the
net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference between the net realizable value
and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years. We expect that trend to continue in
the future. If we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to 10%, the amount of our
capitalized software development costs would not be impaired. Capitalized costs are amortized
based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual
amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the
software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The five-year
period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon
the Company’s forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs. Historically, use of
the Company’s software programs by its clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used
a decade or more.

The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology
consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare
industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the HIT market is rapid
and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry
standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less
valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

Goodwill

The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually
or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where
it is subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value. The Company assesses goodwill for
impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and evaluates impairment indicators at each
quarter end. The Company assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of 2007 and
2006 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis
to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods. Goodwill amounted to
$143,924,000 and $128,819,000 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively. If future,
anticipated cash flows from the Company’s reporting units that recognized goodwill do not
materialize as expected the Company’s goodwill could be impaired, which could result in significant
write-offs.


Income Taxes

In 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes – an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for
Income Taxes.” FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in an enterprise’s tax return. Management makes a number of
assumptions and estimates in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income
taxes. These assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdiction in which the Company
operates as well as current tax regulations. Accruals are established for estimates of tax effects
for certain transactions, business structures and future projected profitability of the Company’s
businesses based on management’s interpretation of existing facts and circumstances. If these
assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances
the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial
statements. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective at the beginning of 2007. The adoption of FIN 48
did not have any impact on Cerner’s consolidated financial position. See Note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to FIN 48.

Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
Company’s disclosure contained herein.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

At December 29, 2007, the Company had a £65,000,000 ($129,779,000 at December 29, 2007) note
payable outstanding through a private placement with an interest rate of 5.54%. The note is
payable in seven equal installments beginning in November 2009. Because the borrowing is
denominated in pounds, the Company is exposed to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate
between the U.S. dollar and the Great Britain pound. The note was entered into for other than
trading purposes. Beginning in 2006, at the beginning of each quarterly period, the Company
designated a portion (between £60 million and £63 million during the year) of its debt (£65
million) that is denominated in Great Britain Pounds, to hedge its net investment in England.
During 2007 the Company designated all £65 million of its debt that is denominated in Great Britain
Pounds.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The Financial Statements and Notes required by this Item are submitted as a separate part of this
report.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9.A. Controls and Procedures

a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report (the
“Evaluation Date”). They have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within
those entities and would be disclosed on a timely basis. The CEO and CFO have concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are effective, to
give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in
reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. They have
also concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to the Company’s


management,
including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

b)

There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
during the three months ended December 29, 2007, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.

c)

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and are effective at that reasonable assurance level. However, the Company’s
management can provide no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal control over financial reporting can prevent all errors and all fraud under all
circumstances. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
the Company have been or will be detected. The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended). The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007. In making this assessment, the Company’s
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company’s management has
concluded that, as of December 29, 2007, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on these criteria. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
that audited the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report has issued an
audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which
is included herein under “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.

Item 9.B. Other Information

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited Cerner Corporation’s (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as
of December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying “Management’s Report over Internal Control of Financial Reporting,” appearing in
Item 9.A. Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on assessed risk.
Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Cerner Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 29,
2007, and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Corporation) as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 29, 2007. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries as of December
29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” effective January
1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Cerner Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report

The management of Cerner Corporation is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and
all other information presented in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances,
and, therefore, included in the financial statements are certain amounts based on management’s
informed estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with
that in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been
audited by Cerner Corporation’s independent registered public accountants and have been reviewed by
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cerner Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Nature of Operations

- The Company designs, develops, markets, installs, hosts and supports
software information technology, healthcare devices and content solutions for healthcare
organizations and consumers. The Company also provides a wide range of value-added services,
including implementing solutions as individual, combined or enterprise-wide systems; hosting
solutions in its data center; and clinical process optimization services. Furthermore, the Company
provides fully–automated on-site employer health clinics and third party administrator health plan
services for employers.

(c)

Revenue Recognition

- Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and
administrative information systems and solutions. The components of the system sales revenues are
the licensing of computer software, deployment period upgrades, installation, content
subscriptions, transaction processing and the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed software.
The components of support, maintenance and service revenues are software support and hardware
maintenance, remote hosting and managed services, training, consulting and implementation services.
For arrangements that include both product and services which are accounted for under SOP 81-1 and
also include support services (PCS) for which vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
(VSOE) of PCS does not exist such that a zero margin approach is used to recognize revenue, the
Company classifies revenue under such arrangements as either systems sales or support, maintenance
and services based on the nature of costs incurred. For similar arrangements for which VSOE of PCS
exists, PCS is separated from the arrangement based on VSOE and the residual amount is allocated to
the software and services accounted for on a combined basis under SOP 81-1. For these
arrangements, the service component of the SOP 81-1 deliverable is classified as support,
maintenance and services based on the VSOE of the services provided and the residual is classified
as systems sales revenue. For the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
approximately $20,000,000 and $16,000,000, respectively, of revenue were included in system sales
and approximately $95,000,000 and $55,000,000, respectively, of revenue were included in support,
maintenance, and services for both such arrangements. The Company provides several models for the
procurement of its clinical, financial and administrative information systems. The predominant
method is a perpetual software license agreement, project-related installation services,
implementation and consulting services, software support and either remote hosting services or
computer hardware and sublicensed software.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP)
97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff
Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). SOP 97-2,
as amended, generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple-elements
to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if fair values
exist for all elements of the arrangement. Pursuant to SOP 98-9, the Company recognizes revenue
from multiple-element software arrangements using the residual method. Under the residual method,
revenue is recognized in a multiple-element arrangement when Company-specific objective evidence of
fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. professional
services, software support, hardware maintenance, remote hosting services, hardware and sublicensed
software), but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement (i.e.
software solutions including project-related installation services). The Company allocates revenue
to each undelivered element in a multiple-element arrangement based on the element’s respective
fair value, with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold
separately. Specifically, the Company determines the fair value of the software support and
maintenance, hardware and sublicensed software support, remote hosting and subscriptions portions
of the arrangement based on the substantive renewal price for these services charged to clients;
professional services (including training and consulting) portion of the arrangement, other than
installation services, based on hourly rates which the Company charges for these services when sold
apart from a software license; and, the hardware and sublicensed software, based on the prices for
these elements when they are sold separately from the software. The residual amount of the fee
after allocating revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements is attributed to the
software


solution, including project-related installation services. If evidence of the fair value
cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement, the entire amount of revenue under the
arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be
established.

The Company provides project-related installation services, which include project-scoping services,
conducting pre-installation audits and creating initial environments. Because installation
services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software, the Company recognizes
the software license and installation services fees over the software installation period using the
percentage of completion method pursuant to Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1),

Accounting for
Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts,

as prescribed by SOP 97-2.
The Company measures the percentage of completion based on output measures which reflect direct
labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at completion of installation.
The installation services process length is dependent upon client specific factors and generally
occurs in the same period the contracts are executed but can extend up to one year.

The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include consulting
activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services. These services
vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may
include additional database consulting, system configuration, project management, testing
assistance, network consulting, post conversion review and application management services.
Implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed to be essential to the
functionality of the software, and thus do not impact the timing of the software license
recognition, unless software license fees are tied to implementation milestones. In those
instances, the portion of the software license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred
until the related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non-forfeitable.
Implementation fees are recognized over the service period, which may extend from nine months to
three years for multi-phased projects.

Remote hosting and managed services are marketed under long-term arrangements generally over
periods of five to 10 years. These services are typically provided to clients that have acquired a
perpetual license for licensed software and have contracted with the Company to host the software
in its data center. Under these arrangements, the client has the contractual right to take
possession of the licensed software at any time during the hosting period without significant
penalty and it is feasible for the client to either run the software on its own equipment or
contract with another party unrelated to the Company to host the software. These services are not
deemed to be essential to the functionality of the licensed software or other elements of the
arrangement and as such, the Company accounts for these arrangements under SOP 97-2, as prescribed
by EITF Issue No. 00-3, Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That
Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware. The hosting and managed
services are recognized as the services are performed.

The Company also offers its solutions on an application service provider (“ASP”) model, making
available time based licenses for the Company’s software functionality and providing the software
solutions on a remote processing basis from the Company’s data centers. The data centers provide
system and administrative support as well as processing services. Revenue on software and services
provided on an ASP or term license basis is combined and recognized on a monthly basis over the
term of the contract. The Company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of third party costs
and direct software installation and implementation costs associated with the initial set up of the
client on the ASP service. These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.

Software support fees are marketed under annual and multi-year arrangements and are recognized as
revenue ratably over the contracted support term. Hardware and sublicensed software maintenance
revenues are recognized ratably over the contracted maintenance term.

Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the contracted terms.

Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized when delivered to the client,
assuming title and risk of loss have transferred to the client.


Where the Company has contractually agreed to develop new or customized software code for a client
as a single element arrangement, the Company utilizes percentage of completion accounting in
accordance with SOP 81-1.

In England, the Company has contracted with third parties to customize software and provide
implementation and support services under long term arrangements (nine years). Because the
arrangements require customization and development of software, and fair value for the support
services does not exist in the arrangements, the entire arrangements are being accounted for as
single units of accounting under SOP 81-1. Also, because the Company believes it is reasonably
assured that no loss will be incurred under these arrangements, it is using the zero margin
approach of applying percentage-of-completion accounting until the software customization and
development services are completed or the Company is able to determine fair value for the support
services. The remaining unrecognized portion of the fee will be recognized ratably over the
remaining term of the arrangement. For the years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
approximately $96,000,000 and $71,000,000, respectively of revenue and expense had been recognized
in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, support, maintenance and other
services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed
and revenue has not been recognized. Long-term deferred revenue at December 29, 2007, represents
amounts received from software support and maintenance services to be earned or provided beginning
in periods on or after December 30, 2007.

The Company incurs out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its client service activities,
primarily travel, which are reimbursed by its clients. The amounts of ”out-of-pocket” expenses and
equal amounts of related reimbursements were $36,778,000, $39,051,000 and $33,387,000 for the years
ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

The Company’s arrangements with clients typically include a deposit due upon contract signing and
date-based licensed software payment terms and payments based upon delivery for services, hardware
and sublicensed software. The Company has periodically provided long-term financing options to
creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has directly provided extended
payment terms to clients from contract date. These extended payment term arrangements typically
provide for date based payments over periods ranging from 12 months up to seven years. Pursuant to
SOP 97-2, because a significant portion of the fee is due beyond one year, the Company has analyzed
its history with these types of arrangements and has concluded that it has a standard business
practice of using extended payment term arrangements and a long history of successfully collecting
under the original payment terms for arrangements with similar clients, product offerings, and
economics without granting concessions. Accordingly, the Company considers the fee to be fixed and
determinable in these extended payment term arrangements and, thus, the timing of revenue is not
impacted by the existence of extended payments. Some of these payment streams have been assigned
on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The Company accounts for the
assignment of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Provided all
revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company recognizes revenue for these arrangements
under its normal revenue recognition criteria, net of any payment discounts from financing
transactions.

The terms of the Company’s software license agreements with its clients generally provide for a
limited indemnification of such intellectual property against losses, expenses and liabilities
arising from third party claims based on alleged infringement by the Company’s solutions of an
intellectual property right of such third party. The terms of such indemnification often limit the
scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace
or modify an infringing solution. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its clients
for any losses related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to third party intellectual
property infringement claims. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification
claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of
the corresponding agreements with its clients, the


Company cannot determine the maximum amount of
potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions.

(d)

Fiscal Year

- The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. All
references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years
unless otherwise noted.

(e)

Software Development Costs

- Costs incurred internally in creating computer software products
are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed
program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently
reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized
based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual
amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the
solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. During 2007, 2006 and
2005, the Company capitalized $65,985,000,  $60,943,000 and $62,039,000, respectively, of total
software development costs of $283,086,000, $262,163,000 and $225,606,000, respectively.
Amortization expense of capitalized software development costs in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
$53,475,000, $45,750,000 and $47,888,000, respectively, and accumulated amortization was
$356,485,000, $303,010,000 and $255,122,000, respectively. Included in 2007 total software
development costs is $8.6 million of research and development activities for the

RxStation

medical
dispensing devices. $3.4 million of this amount recorded in 2007 is related to periods prior to
2007 and is immaterial to both 2007 and the prior periods to which it relates.

(f)

Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of short-term marketable securities with original
maturities less than 90 days.

(g)

Short-term Investments –

The Company’s short-term investments are primarily invested in
auction rate securities which are debt instruments having longer-dated (in most cases, many years)
legal maturities, but with interest rates that are generally reset every 28-49 days under an
auction system. Because auction rate securities are frequently re-priced, they trade in the market
on par-in, par-out basis. Because the Company regularly liquidates its investments in these
securities for reasons including, among others, changes in market interest rates and changes in the
availability of and the yield on alternative investments, the Company has classified these
securities as available-for-sale securities. As available-for-sale securities, these investments
are carried at fair value, which approximates cost. Despite the liquid nature of these
investments, the Company categorizes them as short-term investments instead of cash and cash
equivalents due to the underlying legal maturities of such securities. However, they have been
classified as current assets as they are generally available to support the Company’s current
operations. There have been no realized gains or losses on these investments.

(h)

Inventory

- Inventory consists primarily of computer hardware, sub-licensed software held for
resale and

RxStation

medication dispensing units. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

(i)

Property and Equipment

- Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over periods of
two to 50 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using a straight-line method
over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives, which range from periods of two to 15
years.

(j)

Earnings per Common Share

– Basic earnings per share (EPS) excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. A
reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share
computations are as follows:

end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because they were antidilutive.

(k)

Foreign Currency

- Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is
the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The
net exchange differences resulting from these translations are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain resulting from foreign currency
transactions is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations and amounted to $3,691,000, $3,764,000 and $2,700,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

(l)

Income Taxes

- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

(m)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets –

The Company accounts for goodwill under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator.
All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on
fair value. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of its fiscal
year. There was no impairment of goodwill in 2007 and 2006. The Company used a discounted cash
flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods tested. The
company also evaluated impairment indicators in 2006 and 2007, resulting in no impairment. The
Company’s intangible assets, other than goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives, are
all subject to amortization, are amortized on a straight-line basis, and are summarized as follows:

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(o)

Concentrations

– Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Company’s
cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable
securities, and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and,
therefore, bear minimal risk.

Substantially all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks, physicians, hospitals
and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to
impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access
to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers.
The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future
results.

Accounting for Share-based payments —

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No.
123(R), “Share-Based Payments,” using the modified prospective method of adoption. SFAS 123R
replaces SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS No. 123R addresses
the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and other third parties and
requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the
consolidated statement of earnings.


Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company applied the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 to account for its fixed-plan stock options. Under
this method, compensation expense was recorded on the date of grant only if the current market
price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. As previously allowed under SFAS 123,
the Company only adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123, which established a fair
value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. The following is a
reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings had the Company recorded
compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS 123
for the year ended 2005.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —

The Company follows Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, to account for its derivative and hedging activities.

The Company has issued foreign-denominated debt to manage its foreign currency exposure related to
its net investment in its subsidiary in England. Beginning in 2006, at the beginning of each
quarterly period, the Company designated a portion (between £60 million and £63 million during the
year) of its debt (£65 million), which is denominated in Great Britain Pounds, to hedge its net
investment in England. During 2007 the Company designated all £65 million of its debt that is
denominated in Great Britain Pounds. At December 29, 2007, approximately $1.5 million, net of
approximately $1 million of tax, of increases in the debt related to changes in the foreign
currency exchange rate were included in accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 30,
2006 approximately $9 million, net of approximately $6 million of tax, of increases in the debt
related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate were included in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements —

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), “Fair Value
Measurements.” This statement establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value when
accounting rules require the use of fair value and sets out a framework for measuring fair value
and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 157 on its results of operations
and its financial position and will be required to adopt SFAS 157 as of the first day of the 2008
fiscal year. The effect of adopting SFAS 157 is not expected to be material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.


In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS 159),
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This statement provides
companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The
company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 159 on its results of operations and
its financial position and will be required to adopt SFAS 159 as of the first day of the 2008
fiscal year. The effect of adopting SFAS 159 is not expected to be material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (“SFAS 141(R)”) which replaces
SFAS 141 and supersedes FIN 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations
Accounted for by the Purchase Method”. SFAS 141(R) establishes guidelines for how an acquirer
measures and recognizes the identifiable assets, goodwill, noncontrolling interest, and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. Additionally, SFAS 141(R) outlines the disclosures necessary to
allow financial statement users to assess the impact of the acquisition. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 141(R) on its results of operations and its
financial position, which is expected to be immaterial, and will be required to adopt SFAS 141(R)
prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after the first day of the 2009 fiscal
year.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”, which amends ARB No. 51. SFAS 160
guides that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the
consolidated financial statements, and that net income should be reported at amounts that include
the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 160 on its results of operations and its
financial position, which is expected to be immaterial, and will be required to adopt SFAS 160 as
of the first day of the 2009 fiscal year.

(2) Business Acquisitions

During the three years ended December 29, 2007, the Company completed five acquisitions, which were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The results of each acquisition are
included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations from the date of each acquisition.
Below is a description of the three most significant acquisitions.

On February 22, 2007, the Company completed the purchase of assets of Etreby Computer Company, Inc.
(“Etreby”), for $25,120,000, which was reduced by $1,588,000 for a working capital adjustment in
the second quarter of 2007. Etreby was a software provider of retail pharmacy management systems.
The acquisition of Etreby’s assets has expanded the Company’s pharmacy systems portfolio. The
operating results of Etreby were combined with those of the Company subsequent to the purchase date
of February 22, 2007. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the
identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulted in goodwill of
$12,676,000 and $10,181,000 in intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over
five years. The goodwill was allocated to the Domestic segment and is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. Unaudited
pro-forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of this acquisition was
not material to the Company.

On July 5, 2006, the Company completed the purchase of Galt Associates, Inc., now known as Cerner
Galt, Inc. (“Galt”) for $13,766,000, net of cash acquired. Galt is a provider of safety and risk
management solutions for pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. The
acquisition of Galt has enhanced the Company’s LifeSciences portfolio by adding solutions and
services that use medical event data to monitor and manage the safety and effectiveness of various
therapies. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identified
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulted in goodwill of $9,298,000
and $4,266,000 in intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods
between two and five years. Unaudited pro-forma results of operations for 2006 were not presented
because the effect of this acquisition was not material to the Company.


On January 3, 2005, the Company completed the purchase of assets of the medical business division
of VitalWorks, Inc. for approximately $100,000,000, which was funded with existing cash of
approximately $65,000,000 and borrowings on the revolving line of credit of approximately
$35,000,000. The medical business consists of delivering and supporting physician practice
management, electronic medical record, electronic data interchange and emergency department
information solutions and related products and services to physician practices, hospital emergency
departments, management service organizations and other related entities. The acquisition of
VitalWorks’ medical division expanded the Company’s presence in the physician practice market.
$6,382,000 of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development that had not
reached technological feasibility and is reflected as a charge to earnings in 2005. The
allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identified tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulted in goodwill of $55,166,000 and
$43,450,000 in intangible assets that are being amortized over five years.

A summary of the Company’s purchase acquisitions for the three years ended December 29, 2007, is

Receivables consist of accounts receivable and contracts receivable. Accounts receivable represent
recorded revenues that have been billed. Contracts receivable represent recorded revenues that are
billable by the Company at future dates under the terms of a contract with a client. Billings and
other consideration received on contracts in excess of related revenues recognized are recorded as
deferred revenue. Substantially all receivables are derived from sales and related support and
maintenance and professional services of the Company’s clinical, administrative and financial
information systems and solutions to healthcare providers located throughout the United States and
in certain non-U.S. countries. A summary of receivables is as follows:

(5) Indebtedness

In November 2005, the Company completed a £65,000,000 ($129,779,000 at December 29, 2007) private
placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven
equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2007.

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in
three equal installments, which began in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a
$39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning
December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Company’s credit
facility and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and
fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to
borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at December 29, 2007.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on
November 30, 2006 and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes.
The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only.
Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (7.25% at December 29, 2007)
or LIBOR (4.73% at December 29, 2007) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15%
if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, current
ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s
ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 2/10% is
payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit
matures on May 31, 2010. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its
revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of
VitalWorks. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) This amount was


paid in full
as of December 31, 2005. As of December 29, 2007, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under
this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was in

equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the
Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital improvements
and to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth,
current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the
Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2007.

In March 2004, the Company issued a $7,500,000 promissory note to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of
which $2,500,000 was repaid in October 2004. The balance of the note was paid on April 30, 2007.

The Company also has capital lease obligations amounting to $769,000, payable over the next two

During 2007, the Company had two shareholder approved long-term incentive plans from which it could
issue grants.

Under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan F, the Company is authorized to grant to associates,
directors and consultants 4,000,000 shares of common stock awards taking into account the
stock-split effective January 10, 2006. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options,
restricted stock and performance shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock and performance unit awards which may be payable in the form of common stock or cash
at the Company’s discretion. However, not more than 1,000,000 of such shares will be available for
granting any types of grants other than options or stock appreciation rights. Options under Plan F
are exercisable at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant as determined by
the Stock Option Committee. Options under this plan typically vest over a period of five years as
determined by the Stock Option Committee and are exercisable for periods of up to 25 years.

Under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan G, the Company is authorized to grant to associates and
directors 4,000,000 shares of common stock awards taking into account the stock-split effective
January 10, 2006. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted stock and
performance shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and
performance unit awards which may be payable in the form of common stock or cash at the Company’s
discretion. Options under Plan G are exercisable at a price not less than fair market value on the
date of grant as determined by the Stock Option Committee. Options under this plan typically vest
over a period of five years as determined by the Stock Option Committee and are exercisable for
periods of up to 12 years. In 2007, Long-Term Incentive Plan G was amended to permit Cerner the
ability to recover fringe benefit tax payments made by Cerner on behalf of its associates in India.

In addition to the stock option plans, the Company has also granted 1,708,170 other non-qualified
stock options over time through December 29, 2007, under separate agreements to associates and
certain third parties. These options are exercisable at a price equal to or greater than the fair
market value on the date of grant. These options vest over periods of up to six years and are
exercisable for periods of up to 10 years.

The fair market value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice
option-pricing model for 2007 and 2006 and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for 2005. In
2006, the Company changed its valuation model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to the
lattice pricing model because it is believed to provide greater flexibility for valuing the
substantive characteristics of employee share instruments, resulting in a more accurate estimate of
fair market value. The pricing model requires the use of the following estimates and assumptions:

•

Expected volatilities under the lattice model are based on an equal weighting of implied
volatilities from traded options on the Company’s shares and historical volatility.
Expected volatilities under


the Black-Scholes model were based entirely on the historical
volatility. The Company uses historical data to estimate the stock option exercise and
associate departure behavior used in the lattice model; groups of associates (executives
and non-executives) that have similar historical behavior are considered separately for
valuation purposes.

•

The expected term of stock options granted is derived from the output of the lattice
model and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be
outstanding; the range given below results from certain groups of associates exhibiting
different post-vesting behaviors. The expected term under the Black-Scholes model was
determined using the simplified method of estimating the term as described in Staff
Accounting Bulletin 107.

•

The risk-free rate used in 2007 and 2006 is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond
with a term equal to the contractual term of the awards. The risk-free rate used in 2005
is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the expected term of
the awards.

The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of stock options are as

$1,380,000, $1,031,000 and $494,400, respectively.

Associate Stock Purchase Plan

The Company established an Associate Stock Purchase Plan (ASPP) in 2001, which qualifies under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Each individual employed by the Company and associates
of the Company’s United States based subsidiaries, except as provided below, are eligible to
participate in the Plan (“Participants”). The following individuals are excluded from
participation: (a) persons who, as of the beginning of a purchase period under the Plan, have been
continuously employed by the Company or its domestic subsidiaries for less than two weeks; (b)
persons who, as of the beginning of a purchase period, own directly or indirectly, or hold options
or rights to acquire under any agreement or Company plan, an aggregate of 5% or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all outstanding shares of all classes of Company Common Stock;
and, (c) persons who are customarily employed by the Company for less than 20 hours per week or for
less than five months in any calendar year. Participants may elect to make contributions from 1%
to 20% of compensation to the ASPP, subject to annual limitations determined by the Internal
Revenue Service. Participants may purchase Company Common Stock at a 15% discount on the last
business day of the purchase period. The purchase of the Company’s Common Stock is made through
the ASPP on the open market and subsequently reissued to the associates. Under FAS123R, the
difference of the open market purchase and the participant’s purchase price is being recognized as
compensation expense.

(8) Foundations Retirement Plan

The Cerner Corporation Foundations Retirement Plan (the Plan) is established under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code. All associates over age 18 and not a member of an excluded class are
eligible to participate. Participants may elect to make pretax contributions from 1% to 80% of
eligible compensation to the Plan, subject to annual limitations determined by the Internal Revenue
Service. Participants may direct contributions into mutual funds, a money market fund, a Company
stock fund, or a self-directed brokerage account. The Company makes matching contributions to the
Plan, on behalf of participants, in an amount equal to 33% of the first 6% of the participant’s
salary contribution. The Company’s expenses for the  Plan amounted to $8,280,000, $7,791,000 and
$7,130,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company added a second tier discretionary match to the Plan in 2000. Contributions are based
on attainment of established earnings per share goals for the year or the established financial
metric for the  Plan. Only participants who defer 2% of their base salary are eligible to receive
the discretionary match


contribution. For the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 the Company expensed
$6,019,000, $6,638,000 and $5,783,000 for discretionary distributions, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company determined that due to a change in circumstances in
the quarter, it is more likely than not that certain tax operating loss
carry-forwards in a non-U.S.
jurisdiction would not be realized resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance totaling
approximately $7,982,000. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for
future taxable income over the periods which the remaining deferred tax assets are expected to be
deductible, as well as the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, management believes it
is more likely than not the Company will realize the remaining deferred tax assets. At December
29, 2007, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards subject to Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code for Federal income tax purposes of $19.0 million which are available to offset future
Federal taxable income, if any, through 2020.

The December 30, 2006 deferred tax assets include an adjustment to correct amounts previously
reported for non-U.S. net operating losses related to periods prior to 2005. The effect of this
adjustment is an increase to deferred tax assets and January 1, 2005 retained earnings by
$4,162,000. The impact of this adjustment is not material to previously reported periods.


The effective income tax rates for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 38%, 34% and 36%, respectively. These
effective rates differ from the Federal statutory rate of 35% as follows:

The 2007 and 2006 tax expense amounts include the recognition of approximately $3,125,000 and
$1,994,000 respectively of tax benefits for items related to prior periods. The adjustments in
2007 were recorded primarily to correct an error in the Company’s 2006 state income tax rate.
These differences have accumulated over several years and the impact to any one of these prior
periods is not material. The 2006 amounts relate to tax credits taken on prior income tax returns
and to correct an error in prior years’ effective foreign tax rate, which have accumulated over
several years.

Income taxes payable are reduced by the tax benefit resulting from disqualifying dispositions of
stock acquired under the Company’s stock option plans. The 2007, 2006 and 2005 benefits of
$29,865,000, $9,372,000 and $30,289,000, respectively, are treated as increases to additional
paid-in capital.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an interpretation of
the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
This interpretation clarifies how companies calculate and disclose uncertain tax positions. The
effect of adopting this interpretation did not impact any previously recorded amounts for
unrecognized tax benefits.

The 2007 beginning and ending amounts of accrued interest related to the underpayment of taxes was
$1,150,000 and $202,000, respectively. The Company classifies interest and penalties as income tax
expense in its consolidated statement of earnings, which is consistent with how the Company
previously classified interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes. No
accrual for tax penalties was recorded upon adoption of FIN 48 or at the end of the year.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits including interest was $13,300,000 as of December 31,
2006. During 2007, the Company effectively settled IRS examinations for the 1998 to 2004 periods
and as a result reclassified previously recorded reserves for tax uncertainties by $9,845,000
including interest. Of this amount, $1,732,000 was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense
in 2007. The years after 2004 remain open. As of December 29, 2007, the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, was $8,069,000. All of this amount, if recognized,
would affect the effective tax rate. The Company does not expect the current amount of its unrecognized tax
benefits to change materially over the next 12 months.

(10) Related Party Transactions

The
Company leases an airplane from PANDI, Inc. (PANDI), a company owned by Mr. Neal L. Patterson
and Mr. Clifford W. Illig, the Company’s Chairman/CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board, respectively.
The airplane is leased on a per mile basis with no minimum usage guarantee. The lease rate is
believed to approximate fair market value for this type of aircraft. During 2007, 2006 and 2005
the Company paid an aggregate of $661,000, $670,000 and $812,000 for the rental of the airplane,
respectively. The airplane is used principally by Mr. Trace Devanny, President, and Mr. Mike
Valentine, Executive Vice President, to make client visits.

On February 6, 2007, the Company entered into an Aircraft Service Agreement between Rockcreek
Aviation, Inc. (the Company’s wholly-owned flight operations subsidiary) and PANDI. Under this
agreement Rockcreek Aviation provides flight operations services to PANDI with respect to PANDI’s
aircraft. PANDI owns and operates a Beechcraft, BeechJet 400. During 2007, the aircraft services
fees paid by PANDI to the Company were $238,000.


(11) Commitments

In prior years, the Company leased space to unrelated parties in its North Kansas City headquarters
complex and in other business locations under noncancelable operating leases. Included in other
revenues is rental income of $305,000 and $583,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company did
not receive rental income in 2007.

The Company is committed under operating leases for office space and computer equipment through
October 2027. Rent expense for office and warehouse space for
the Company’s regional and global
offices for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $12,436,000, $11,391,000 and $9,056,000, respectively.

(12) Segment Reporting

The
Company has two operating segments, Domestic and Global. Revenues are derived primarily from
the sale of clinical, financial and administrative information systems and solutions. The cost of
revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed
software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also
includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the
manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred by the geographic business segments consist of sales
and client service expenses including salaries of sales and client service personnel,
communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Performance of the segments is assessed
at the operating earnings level and, therefore, the segment operations have been presented as such.
“Other” includes revenues not generated by the operating segments and expenses such as software
development, marketing, general and administrative, share-based compensation expense and
depreciation that have not been allocated to the operating segments. It is impractical for the
Company to track assets by geographical business segment.

Accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those used on a
consolidated basis. The following table presents a summary of the operating information for the
years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

Includes a tax benefit of $7.9 million related to the extension of the Federal Research and Development
Credit, the recognition of certain state tax benefits and adjustments to correct certain federal and foreign
items unrelated to the fourth quarter of 2006. This results in an increase to dilted earnings per share of $0.10.


Immaterial Corrections

During 2007, certain errors were identified that impacted amounts previously reported on our Form
10-Q for the 2007 quarterly periods and on our Form 10-K for the prior annual periods. These items
separately and in the aggregate did not have a material impact on results previously reported in
2007 or prior periods. However, we have revised our previously reported quarterly results in 2007
to reflect the adjustments in the appropriate quarterly period. These items are:

Research and Development

In connection with production and delivery of the

RxStation

medication dispensing devices, the
Company reviewed the accounting treatment of previously capitalized costs related to this device
and determined a write-off was necessary. The fourth quarter of 2007 in the table below includes
additional after tax expense of $2.1 million, net of $1.3 million tax benefit, related to periods
prior to 2007.

State Income Taxes

This adjustment relates to the use of a higher estimated effective state income tax rate than the
actual effective rate in computing the Company’s current tax provision. The Company’s fourth
quarter of 2007 in the table below includes a decrease in tax expense of $3.1 million related to
the 2006 period.

Foreign Taxes

This adjustment corrected a tax item of $4.2 million previously reported in the second quarter of
2007 relating to foreign net operating losses for periods prior to 2005. This adjustment has been
corrected through an adjustment to the January 1, 2005 retained earnings. The second item is due to
a reduction in foreign income tax rates resulting from a law that was enacted in the third quarter
of 2007, which effectively reduced the value of the Company’s foreign tax losses.

A summary of the quarterly adjustments for 2007 is set forth below:
