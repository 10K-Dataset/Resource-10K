Part I

Item 1. Business

Overview

Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the “Company”) is a Delaware business
incorporated in 1980. The Company’s principal offices are located at 2800
Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri 64117. Its telephone number is
(816) 221-1024. The Company’s Web site address is www.cerner.com. The Company
makes available free of charge, on or through its Web site, its annual report
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and
all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such
material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities Exchange
Commission.

Cerner is taking the paper chart out of health care, eliminating error,
variance and unnecessary waste in the care process. With more than 1,500
clients worldwide, Cerner is the leading supplier of health care information
technology.

Cerner

® solutions give end users secure access to clinical,
administrative and financial data in real time. Consumers retrieve appropriate
care information and educational resources via the Internet.

Cerner implements these solutions as stand-alone, combined or enterprise-wide
systems.

Cerner

solutions can be managed by the Company’s clients or via an
application outsourcing/hosting model. Cerner provides hosted solutions from
its data center in Lee’s Summit, Missouri.

Cerner

solutions are designed and developed using the

Cerner Millennium™

architecture. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is a state-of-the-art
technology infrastructure that combines clinical, financial and management
information applications. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture provides access to
an individual’s electronic medical record at the point of care and organizes
information for the specific needs of the physician, nurse, laboratory
technician, pharmacist or other care provider.

Health care organizations utilize data gathered and stored within the

Cerner
Millennium

architecture to improve the safety, efficiency and productivity of
the entire enterprise. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture also delivers
medical knowledge to the point of care to help clinicians predict outcomes
of treatment plans and deliver the most effective care.

Health Care Industry

The health care industry in the United States remains highly fragmented, very
complex and remarkably inefficient. While science and medical technology
continue to make significant progress in dealing with human disease and injury,
the management and clinical processes within delivery organizations have made
little progress in the past 20 years. Even today, the clinical workflow at most
organizations depends on manual, paper-based medical records systems augmented
by partial automation. This scattered approach has created an
industry in which inappropriate
variances in medical outcomes and wasted resources are commonplace.

Significant pressures are at work within the health care industry to eliminate
variance and waste. Several parties, including the government, employer groups
and consumer organizations, are demanding heightened efforts to eliminate
medical error and reduce the costs of health care delivery. Financial
pressures, a workforce shortage and government regulations create additional
challenges for health care executives.

In November 1999, the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Science (“IOM”) released a report titled
“To Err is Human,” which estimated that up to 98,000 lives are lost each year
due to preventable medical errors. That makes medical error one of the top 10
causes of death in the United States.



A follow-up IOM report in March 2001 cited the use of information technology
(“IT”) as critical to improving the quality and safety of health care. Yet, the
IOM’s November 2002 report, “Fostering Rapid Advances in Health Care,” still
cited, “despite some laudable examples of integrated care, the delivery system
consists of silos, often lacking even rudimentary information capabilities to
exchange patient information, coordinate care across settings and multiple
providers, and ensure continuity of care over time.” The pressure to spark
change remains strong, and continues to intensify. Most health care
organizations have yet to implement comprehensive, enterprise-wide IT
solutions. The Washington Post, in a December 2002 article, said that “the vast
majority of hospitals still rely on paper charts that often can’t be located
and are difficult to decipher, rather than more accessible and legible
computerized medical records. Fewer than 3 percent have fully implemented
computerized drug ordering systems, which have consistently shown dramatic
reductions in drug errors.”

In addition to the recent reports cited above, which both justify and promote
the use of IT solutions in health care organizations, the Leapfrog Group
(“Leapfrog”), a consortium of large employers, is calling for systemic change
in the health care industry. Leapfrog recommends that employers select health
plans with hospitals that, among other criteria, employ a computerized
physician order entry system (“CPOE”) as a primary method for eliminating
medication-related errors. Leapfrog estimates that 1 million serious medication errors
occur annually in United States hospitals, and that the total cost to United
States hospitals is believed to exceed $2 billion each year

. [Leapfrog Group,
2000].

And a staggering number of errors prove preventable, as shown, for
example, in a study by David W. Bates, M.D., and colleagues, released in March,
2003 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which revealed that
more than 42 percent of serious, life-threatening or fatal adverse drug events
that occurred among an outpatient study sample were deemed preventable.

On the financial front, health care organizations are reporting improved bottom
lines compared to a few years ago when the effects of the Balanced Budget Act
were most damaging. According to a Deloitte & Touche survey, 67 percent of
hospital Chief Executive Officers (“CEOs”) report that their organizations are
profitable, up from 58 percent in 2000. But “the median profit margin among
respondents was a mere 2.1 percent. CEOs believe that profits will increase
modestly to a 3.1 percent margin over the next five years.”

[Deloitte &
Touche’s “The Future of Health Care: An Outlook from the Perspective of
Hospital CEOs,” 2002].

Despite a forecasted increase in profit margins, surveyed hospital CEOs still
worry about financial failure in the future. Claims processing is just one
example of an area contributing to staggering waste; it is projected that 25 to
30 percent of health care expenditures are lost to inefficiencies in claims
processing, which translates to $400-$480 billion wasted annually, according to
a September 2002 Healthcare Informatics article. Other leading hospital CEO
concerns include decreasing reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid cases,
rising costs of employee salaries, skyrocketing drug costs and a greater need
for capital investments to meet the demands of a growing consumer base.

Another factor adding to the increased financial pressure on health care
organizations is the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). Health care organizations must find
money within their budgets to pay for measures to comply with HIPAA. HIPAA
governs security and patient confidentiality and requires a centralized and
systematic method of access control. Most health care organizations estimate
they will spend $2.5 million to comply with security and confidentiality
requirement deadlines that will become effective in 2003. Cerner believes
compliance with both the security and patient confidentiality and the access
control HIPAA regulations is best achieved with a single, unified IT solutions
architecture.

Another threat to the health care system is a growing shortage of personnel.
According to a 2002 American Hospital Association Workforce Study, 89 percent
of hospital CEOs report significant workforce shortages. The shortages impact
all areas of the hospital, but most prevalently affect nursing, radiology and
pharmacy.

Many hospitals are turning to IT solutions to help recruit and retain
clinicians, as IT solutions can significantly reduce the amount of paperwork
clinicians perform. A recent study commissioned by the American Hospital
Association and performed by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers found that



each hour of skilled nursing care results in 30 minutes of paperwork, while
each hour of emergency department care generates a full hour of subsequent
paperwork.

[PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2001].

IT solutions automate processes and reduce the time clinicians spend poring
over paperwork. Clinicians can then devote more time to patients and can
deliver a higher quality of care—both of which contribute to increased job
satisfaction.

The workforce issues are particularly critical as health care providers prepare
for the increased demand for services that Baby Boomers will create. By 2010,
the average Baby Boomer will be 65 years old. The sheer number of older
consumers needing health care including management of chronic conditions will overburden the system, analysts predict. In
addition, these health care consumers will be more knowledgeable than prior
generations about the use of IT solutions in service industries and Cerner
believes will demand the use of IT solutions to improve the efficiency and
quality of health care in their communities.

In order to stay competitive in this dynamic marketplace, health care
organizations must deploy IT solutions that automate the paper-based medical
records system and create stronger relationships with consumers, physicians,
hospitals and managed care organizations. These same IT solutions also must
help organizations reduce costs and comply with regulatory requirements.

Cerner has proactively addressed the changing and increasing needs of the
health care industry discussed above by developing the

Cerner Millennium

architecture

.

See “Cerner Technology—

Cerner Millennium Architecture

” for a more
in-depth explanation of this unparalleled architecture.

The Cerner Vision

Cerner

solutions and the Company's business approach are organized around a central
vision of how health care can and should operate. This vision is founded on
four steps:

•

Automate the Core Processes of Health Care

•

Connect the Person

•

Structure the Knowledge

•

Close the Loop

Automate the Core Processes

Cerner is dedicated to the elimination of the paper medical record and paper-based processes.

As long as medical information is isolated in a paper record, the inadequacies
of today’s health care delivery system will remain. Nurses and pharmacists will
be forced to interpret illegible and incomplete orders. Physicians will not
benefit from the real-time, contextual reference information available in
automated solutions. And clinicians throughout a health care organization will
continue to search for the single copy of the paper-based record. When it is
not readily available, they will be forced to make critical care decisions
without adequate information.

The elimination of the paper record will lead to improved quality and safety of
health care. It will increase productivity and generate better documentation
from which clinical outcomes, financial performance and resource utilization
can be benchmarked and analyzed.

With an electronic medical record, clinicians view demographic information,
medical history, lab results, vital signs and treatment plans, along with notes
from health care team members. Guidelines and pathways relevant to the person’s
medical condition help the physician make the best possible decisions in
diagnosing and treating the patient. This comprehensive view of the person’s
health ensures safer and higher-quality care.

Online documentation and physician order entry reduce errors and eliminate
duplication of services—and the costs associated with both. Documentation
required to write claims and seek reimbursement for services is maintained
efficiently, thus reducing claim denials and shortening the time that passes
between claims submission and payment.



Once all the steps of health care are captured electronically, the enhanced
documentation will create the foundation for data collection that will be the
backbone of structuring the knowledge of health care.

Connect the Person

Cerner is dedicated to helping its clients build a personal health system, a
new medium between the person and the physician, which empowers the individual
and delivers higher-quality health care across communities

.

The health care system is undergoing fundamental change as the person moves to
the center of health care delivery. Increasing access to expert knowledge over
the Internet and a cultural shift toward self-directed care are moving the
center of power and control away from the health care provider and toward the
health care consumer.

With the personal health record, individuals can store and access their medical
information securely from anywhere they have Internet access. When combined
with personalized health content, consumers gain a better sense of the care
they are receiving and the options available to them. They communicate better
with providers and, resulting in healthier communities.

Structure the Knowledge

Cerner is dedicated to building information systems that treat every clinical
decision as a learning event. Cerner solutions enable the industry to
structure, store and study the application and outcomes of medical practice.

Medicine must have a structure that allows physicians to record treatment and
outcomes in such a way that it can be compared and contrasted with other
methods. A common data foundation that can exactly capture the meaning of input
from the diverse nomenclatures of physicians and clinicians is a necessary first step.

Cerner

solutions store health care data and provide a framework for
comparability. This enables physicians to make sense of and glean value from
the information that is gathered through automated processes and connected
persons. Without a knowledge framework, data collected will provide no real
benefit. By building this structure, Cerner opens the door for every encounter
with a patient and every piece of new knowledge to be catalogued, measured and
analyzed. This knowledge framework will deliver better care and an improved
understanding of medicine.

Close the Loop

Cerner is dedicated to building information systems that deliver evidence-based
medicine, dramatically reducing the average time from the discovery of an
improved method to the change in medical practice.

Advances in technology offer great opportunities in health care and must be
used to deliver better care faster. The information learned must be applied.
Today, patients may wait as long as 10 years before new medical knowledge
reaches widespread use. With systems designed to embed evidence-based medicine
inside the clinician’s workflow#using pathways, guidelines and
alerts#physicians know that every medical decision is based on the best and
most recent knowledge available. The results will be better outcomes and
reduced variance.

The Cerner Strategy

Key elements of Cerner’s business strategy include:

Penetrate the integrated health care provider market.

Large health care systems
represent a significant component of the health care information technology
market. These organizations focus on improving safety and reducing costs
through operating efficiencies. Cerner’s enterprise-wide, person-centric,
clinical and management solutions provide the technology to manage health care
across an organization, significantly reduce costs, improve the efficiency of
delivery and enhance the quality of care.

Increase market share in individual domains and further penetrate the existing
client base.

Cerner expects continued growth in clinical domain systems for
specific markets such as nursing, physician office, laboratory, pharmacy,
radiology, surgery, emergency medicine and cardiology, as institutions look



to restructure and reengineer these high-cost centers. Cerner anticipates
growth in sales of new solutions, such as its

Clinically Driven Revenue Cycle

™
solution launched in 2001, new management reporting data warehouse launched in
2002,

Executable Knowledge

® content acquired in 2002 and home health care
solution to be introduced in 2003. The Company also intends to aggressively
market

Cerner

clinical and management information systems and services to its
existing client base.

Remain committed to a common architecture.

Because Cerner believes that the
constituents in health management need to work together to benefit defined
populations in a community, Cerner has made a commitment to a single, unified
architecture as its platform for healthcare information
management solutions that span the health enterprise.
This platform enables the

Cerner Millennium

architecture to be scalable on a
linear basis, using either

Cerner

compatible modules for process-oriented
applications or competitive systems interfaced using open system protocols.

Expand solutions and services.

Building upon the

Cerner Millennium

architecture, Cerner intends to continue expanding the range of applications
and services offered to providers. These new solutions and services will
complement existing solutions, address clients’ emerging IT needs and employ
technological advances. Cerner believes that major opportunities exist as
providers reach into new markets and offer more alternative services to remain
competitive. The Company believes these organizations will find value in having
personal health records and trusted medical information accessible to the
individual in the home. Cerner recognizes the potential value of the aggregate
database being developed by its broad client base. This database would be a
powerful means of enabling comparative or normative procedure evaluations. The
substantial project management, process redesign, technology integration and
training involved in health care systems taking advantage of the opportunities
provided by clinical and management information technology represent a
significant market for Cerner’s consulting services.

Continue pursuit of excellence in implementations.

Since the introduction of
the

Cerner Millennium

architecture – a revolutionary concept and application
offering that ventured into complex, uncharted territories – Cerner has
dramatically improved the implementation process. With the benefit of more than
1,700

Cerner Millennium

conversions (at the conclusion of 2002) and more than
4,700 associates, including nearly 800 clinicians and more than 1,800
consultants, Cerner has steadily decreased implementation timelines while
increasing the number of applications converted within those timelines. The
Cerner Implementation Methodology and Accelerated Solutions Center, along with
deep expertise in transition management and workflow optimization, have enabled
Cerner to create and deploy best practices that contribute significantly to
speed and value.

Offer its solutions on a hosted solution basis.

The Company offers

Cerner
Millennium

solutions through its application outsourcing option. This option
delivers IT services that include software, computer hardware, implementation,
technical support, wide-area network services and automatic software upgrades.
Unlike traditional software implementations, software delivered through the
application outsourcing option is not installed at the clients facility, but is
delivered, operated and maintained in Cerner’s solutions center in a rapidly
accelerated implementation timeframe. Using hosted solutions, any size
organization can access the same robust clinical applications, architecture and
user-interface advantages that were previously only available to larger
institutions.

Cerner Technology—Cerner Millennium Architecture

The cornerstone of Cerner’s technology strategy is the

Cerner Millennium

architecture

,

the single architecture around which each of Cerner’s solutions
is developed. This person-centric, single data model, open and highly scalable
architecture allows Cerner to meet the clinical, financial, management and
business information requirements of a health care delivery system across the
continuum of care. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture

,

the core of which was
developed between 1994 and 1999, is Cerner’s computing platform. The

Cerner
Millennium

architecture uses flexible n-tiered client/server technology to
optimize distributed computing performance and scalability across multiple
client and server platforms. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture and
applications were designed and developed to accommodate health care specific
requirements for mission-critical computing and secure access from all settings
along the care delivery continuum. The breadth of focus and functionality of
the

Cerner Millennium

architecture and solutions are well suited for
large-scale and enterprise application technologies for health care
organizations.



The value of the

Cerner Millennium

architecture to a client organization is the
enterprise-wide use of a single system based on a fully unified common
architecture and database. With its single data model and comprehensive
electronic medical record, the

Cerner Millennium

architecture provides secure,
real-time access to all information across multiple applications, domains,
organizations and physical locations, including physician, hospital, nursing,
laboratory, pharmacy and consumers, to all authorized providers requiring such
access. Given its unified and open design, the

Cerner Millennium

architecture
can also provide a centralized repository of clinical and financial
transactions to help standardize access and messaging of disparate applications
across a health system.

The alternative to a single architectural approach is to use disparate systems
based on differing architectures and data structures to automate the care
process across the continuum of care. These disparate systems must be
interfaced together and rely on these interfaces to transmit, modify and
arrange data exchanged between them, which limits the data’s usefulness across
multiple systems and inhibits real-time access. In addition, many of these
systems lack functional scalability and cannot operate across multiple provider
settings or locations within a health care organization, constraining
organizations’ potential to realize full benefits in operational efficiencies
and care quality.

Several overarching capabilities are embedded into the

Cerner Millennium

architecture. First is the capability for person-centric transactions and secure messaging,
which consider the breadth of requirements not only of a patient, but also of
healthy consumers. Second is health care community dynamics, which take into
account the flexibility required by the constantly changing relationships
between health care organizations, physicians and consumers, and the need to
maintain complex security and user preferences based on the context and
business attributes of the transaction in a community setting. Third is the
ability to proactively deliver patient, provider and condition-specific
knowledge and content in the form of alerts, best practices and
pathways—content in context—at the point of decision, empowering physicians
with the most complete, most timely information available when making decisions
about care delivery.

Diverse Cerner clients located around the globe are reaping the benefits of the

Cerner Millennium

architecture

,

increasing efficiency and improving care
quality. A brief sampling of client feedback includes:

“We believe in Cerner’s ability to execute on its vision and have benefited
greatly from the decision to partner with Cerner. Cerner’s architecture
makes it the best CPOE solution for the University of Illinois Medical
Center. As we develop more advanced clinical decision support,

Cerner
Millennium

places critical patient information—including laboratory
results—within the decision-making process. The advancements we have made
fully support our mission to provide the highest possible scientific and
ethical standards in all that we do: patient care, education and research.”

Joy Keeler, Assistant Vice Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago

“I always talk about Cerner, the rules and alerts, when I go to schools
to talk to students. Technology is a very high value for them. Information
technology is an investment in the future of our workforce.”

Terrie Sterling, Vice President of Patient Care Services, Our Lady of the
Lake Regional Medical Center (Louisiana)

“Morale gets a boost because

PowerChart

reduces the frustration and time
previously associated with trying to obtain paper records, plus it provides
legible records and rapid access to lab results and dictated documents.
Communication between providers in different venues is faster and less
repetitive. I have noticed a significant improvement in the quality and
timeliness of documentation, because staff members know that their work will
be available, read and used by other providers.”

Dr. Corabell Arps, Pediatric/Adolescent Psychology, Eastern Maine Healthcare

Throughout 2003 and 2004, Cerner will focus on further contemporizing the

Cerner Millennium

architecture with new technologies and human interfaces that
enhance usability, personalization and system management via browser-based
applications.

are configured via table-driven parameters. These sophisticated methodologies
result in decreased implementation times and greater client satisfaction.

Software Development

Cerner commits significant resources to developing new health information
system solutions. As of December 28, 2002, approximately 1,591 associates were
engaged full-time in software solutions development activities. Total
expenditures for the development and enhancement of the Company’s software
solutions were approximately $149,985,000, $113,872,000 and $90,694,000 during
the 2002, 2001 and 2000 fiscal years, respectively. These figures include both
capitalized and non-capitalized portions and exclude amounts amortized for
financial reporting purposes.

The Company expects to continue investment and development efforts for its
current and future solution offerings. As new clinical and management
information needs emerge, Cerner intends to enhance its current software
solutions lines with new versions released to clients on a periodic basis. In
addition, Cerner plans to: expand its current software solutions lines by
developing additional information systems for clinical, financial, operational
and/or consumer use; continue to support simultaneous use of Cerner’s solutions
across multiple facilities; and, continue to expand in the global marketplace.

The Company is committed to maintaining open attributes in its system
architecture through operability in a diverse set of technical and application
environments. The Company strives to design its systems to co-exist with
disparate applications developed and supported by other suppliers. This effort
is exemplified by Cerner’s

Sales and Marketing

The markets for Cerner’s information system solutions include integrated
delivery networks, physician groups and networks and their management service
organizations, managed care organizations, hospitals, medical centers,
free-standing reference laboratories, blood banks, imaging centers, pharmacies,
pharmaceutical manufacturers, employer coalitions and public health
organizations. To



date, a substantial portion of system sales has been in clinical applications
in hospital-based provider organizations.

Cerner’s Millennium

architecture is
highly scalable, with applications being used in hospitals ranging from under
50 beds to over 2,000 beds and managed care settings with over 2,000,000
members. All

Cerner Millennium

applications are designed to operate on either
computers manufactured by HP Computer Corporation or IBM’s RISC System/6000 AIX
(UNIX) platform, thereby allowing Cerner to be price competitive across the
full range of size and organizational structure of health care providers. The
sale of a health information system usually takes approximately nine to
eighteen months, from the time of initial contact to the signing of a contract.

The Company’s executive marketing management is located in its North Kansas
City, Missouri, headquarters, while its client representatives are deployed
across the United States and globally. In addition to the United States, the
Company, through subsidiaries and joint ventures, has sales staff and/or
offices in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Argentina, Germany, Singapore, Malaysia,
Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. Cerner’s consolidated revenues include
foreign sales of $29,412,000, $22,350,000 and $25,815,000 for the 2002, 2001
and 2000 fiscal years, respectively. The Company supports its sales force with
technical personnel who perform demonstrations of Cerner’s solutions and assist
clients in determining the proper hardware and software configurations. The
Company’s primary direct marketing strategy is to generate sales contacts from
its existing client base and through presentations at industry seminars and
tradeshows. Cerner attends a number of major tradeshows each year and sponsors
executive conferences, which feature industry experts who address the
information system needs of large health care organizations.

Client Services

All of Cerner’s clients enter into software maintenance agreements with Cerner
for support of their

Cerner

systems. In addition to immediate software support
in the event of problems, these agreements allow clients the use of new
releases of the

Cerner

solutions covered by maintenance agreements. Each
client has 24-hour access to the client support staff located at Cerner’s world
headquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri and the Company’s global support
organization in Brussels, Belgium. Most of Cerner’s clients also enter into
hardware maintenance agreements with Cerner. These arrangements normally
provide for a fixed monthly fee for specified services. In the majority of
cases, Cerner subcontracts hardware maintenance to the hardware manufacturer.

Backlog

At December 28, 2002, Cerner had a contract backlog of approximately
$732,719,000 as compared to approximately $566,280,000 at December 29, 2001.
Such backlog represents system sales from signed contracts, which had not yet
been recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue on a percent of
completion basis, based on certain milestone conditions, for its software
products. At December 28, 2002, the Company had approximately $84,054,000 of
contracts receivable, which represents revenues recognized under the percentage
of completion method but not yet billable under the terms of the contract. At
December 28, 2002, Cerner had a software support and maintenance backlog of
approximately $269,153,000 as compared to approximately $221,393,000 at
December 29, 2001. Such backlog represents contracted software support and
hardware maintenance services for a period of twelve months. The Company
estimates that approximately 51 percent of the aggregate backlog at December
28, 2002 of $1,001,872,000 will be recognized as revenue during 2003.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

In 2002, the Company set records in bookings, revenues, pro-forma earnings and
cash flow for the third consecutive year. The Company continued to expand the
breadth of its applications, offering nearly 50 different information
technology solutions at the end of 2002. The strength of the Company’s
application breadth is evidenced in record bookings contributions from ten
different major application categories in 2002. The Company continued to build
new client relationships and expand market share in 2002, with approximately 40
percent of new business bookings coming from clients that had no prior
relationship with the Company. The Company also continued to strengthen its
strategic presence in Europe. Operationally, the Company brought more than 500

Cerner Millennium

applications live in 2002, bringing the total number of live
applications to more than 1,700.

The Company continued to increase its presence in new markets in 2002. During
2002, the Company made good progress at implementing its new patient accounting
solution,

ProFit

, and now has over 10 sites live.

Cerner ProVision

, the
Company’s enterprise-wide image management solution that was launched in 2001,
was brought live by four clients and sold to another 12 during 2002. The
Company also expanded its managed services business and now has over 80 clients
relying on its data center for hosting of technology services.

Health care organizations remain under significant pressures to improve the
quality of care and eliminate variance and waste. Several parties, including
the government, employer groups and consumer organizations, are demanding
heightened efforts to eliminate medical error and reduce the costs of health
care delivery. The Institute of Medicine has issued three major reports since
1999 that identify preventable medical errors as a major cause of death in the
United States and suggest implementing information technology as a key part of
the solution to preventing these unnecessary deaths. The Leapfrog Group, a
consortium of large employers, continues to call for systemic change in the
health care industry, and is a major proponent of requiring deployment of
computerized physician order entry systems to reduce medical errors. The
industry is also facing significant clinician shortages, particularly in
nursing, radiology and pharmacy. The aging Baby Boomers, whose average age
will be 65 years old in 2010, are expected to put added pressure on the health
care system as their need for care increases. The Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) adds an additional element of complexity
for health care organizations around security and patient confidentiality.

The Company believes most of the issues faced by health care organizations
today can be effectively addressed with information technology. And the
Company believes that its investment in the

Cerner Millennium

architecture
creates a major competitive advantage.

Cerner Millennium

is a fully
integrated, large-scale, contemporary, enterprise-wide architecture. This
unification and the breadth of the Company’s solutions position the Company
very well to help health care organizations address the critical issues they
face today.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 28, 2002, Compared to Year Ended December 29, 2001

The Company’s revenues increased 39% to $751,852,000 in 2002 from $542,423,000
in 2001. The Company had net earnings of $48,022,000 in 2002 compared to a net
loss of $42,366,000 in 2001. Net earnings, before special charges and credits,
were $51,825,000 in 2002 compared to $34,217,000 in 2001. Operating results
for 2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available-for-sale
securities and a charge for the impairment of investments, and a change in
accounting principle for goodwill. Operating results for 2001, as described
below, included a gain on software license settlement and investment losses.

Revenues

- In 2002, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales,
support of installed systems and an increase in services. System sales
increased 36% to $332,274,000 in 2002 from $244,979,000 in 2001. Included in
system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. The increase in system sales is due to an increase in new contract
bookings in 2002 compared to 2001.



Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 41% to $419,578,000 in 2002
from $297,444,000 in 2001. Support and maintenance revenues were $171,238,000
and $140,666,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Services revenues were
$248,340,000 and $156,778,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in
support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of
software and hardware, and professional services, excluding installation. This
increase was due primarily to the increase in professional services, resulting
from an increase in services related to and services provided into the
Company’s installed and converted client base.

At December 28, 2002, the Company had $732,719,000 in contract backlog and
$269,153,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $566,280,000 in
contract backlog and $221,393,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end
of 2001.

Cost of Revenues

- The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party
consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from
computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes
the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted
to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 22% of total revenues in 2002,
and 21% of total revenues in 2001. Such costs, as a percent of revenues,
typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and
support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to
period. The increase in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues
resulted principally from an increase in the percent of revenue from computer
hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue
percentage.

Sales and Client Service

- Sales and client service expenses include salaries
of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel
expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses,
tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total
revenues were 42% in both 2002 and 2001. The increase in total sales and client
service expenses is attributable to the cost of a larger field sales and
services organization and marketing of new solutions.

Software Development

- Software development expenses include salaries,
documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and
amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software
development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2002
and 2001 were $149,985,000 and $113,872,000, respectively. These amounts
exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $49,984,000 and
$37,828,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively.

General and Administrative

- General and administrative expenses include
salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities,
communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of
total revenues were 7% in both 2002 and 2001.

Interest Expense, Net

-

Interest income was $1,080,000 in 2002 compared to
$2,896,000 in 2001. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in interest
rates and average invested cash. Interest expense was $6,635,000 in 2002
compared to $7,321,000 in 2001, primarily as a result of lower borrowing
levels during the year.

Other Income, Net

- Other income decreased to $87,000 in 2002 from $182,000 in
2002. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space leased to
third parties.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment —

In December 2002, the Company exercised
1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis
and carrying value of $4,146,000. The warrants were scheduled to expire on
January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold 1,048,783 shares of
WebMD for $8,242,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of
$527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a result of the exercise of the warrants
and the sale of the shares. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold
14,820,527 shares of WebMD for $90,119,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded
an investment gain of $2,736,000, net of $1,572,000 in tax, as a result of the
sale.



Impairment of Investment —

The Company’s policy is to review declines in fair
value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than
temporary. Based on events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of tax of $3,623,000, for the
impairment of various investments in non-publicly traded securities. The
charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the
Company’s investment in Protocare, Inc, a non-publicly traded company.
During the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a write-down of its
investment in WebMD from $15.00 to $5.79. Accordingly, the Company recognized
a charge to earnings of $81,419,000, net of $46,197,000 in tax.

Gain on Software License Settlement —

On June 18, 2001, the Company reached an
agreement with WebMD Corporation regarding certain performance metrics related
to specified levels of physician usage arising out of the original license
transaction between the Company and WebMD. Under the agreement, the Company
received 2,000,000 shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11,580,000, in exchange
for $432,000 in cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to the
Company by WebMD. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized a gain
of $4,836,000, net of $2,744,000 in tax.

Income Taxes

- The Company’s effective tax rate was an expense of 39% in 2002
and a benefit of 33% in 2001. The benefit is a result of the loss on the WebMD
shares and other permanent differences.

Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are
no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there
is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit,
where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company
completed its transitional review of the Company’s goodwill values in the
second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined
that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was
impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper
and Associates was a supply chain re-engineering consulting practice. The
impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of
tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow
analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units.

Year Ended December 29, 2001, Compared to Year Ended December 30, 2000

The Company’s revenues increased 35% to $542,423,000 in 2001 from $400,824,000
in 2000. The Company had a net loss of $42,366,000 in 2001 compared to net
earnings of $105,265,000 in 2000. Net earnings, before special charges and
credits were $34,217,000 in 2001 compared to $20,366,000 in 2000. Operating
Results for 2001, as described below, included a gain on software license
settlement and investment losses. Operating results for 2000, as described
below, included a realized investment gain and loss, write-offs of acquired
in-process research and development and a write-down of intangible assets.

Revenues

- In 2001, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales and
support of installed systems. System sales increased 37% to $244,979,000 in
2001 from $179,173,000 in 2000. Included in system sale are revenues from the
sale of software, hardware, sublicensed software and professional services.
The increase in system sales is due to an increase in new contract bookings in
2001 compared to 2000.

Support and maintenance and service revenues increased 34% in 2001 compared to
2000. Support and maintenance revenues were $140,666,000 and $114,896,000 in
2001 and 2000, respectively. Service revenues were $156,778,000 and
$106,755,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in support, maintenance
and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, and
professional services, excluding installation. This increase was due primarily
to the increase in professional services, resulting from an increase in
services related to and services provided into the Company’s installed and
converted client base.



At December 29, 2001, the Company had $566,280,000 in contract backlog and
$221,393,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $439,943,000 in
contract backlog and $184,360,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end
of 2000.

Cost of Revenues

- The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party
consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from
computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes
the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted
to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 21% of total revenues in 2001,
and 22% of total revenues in 2000. Such costs, as a percent of revenues,
typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and
support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to
period. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues
resulted principally from a decrease in the percent of revenue from computer
hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue
percentage.

Sales and Client Service

- Sales and client service expenses include salaries
of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel
expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses,
tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total
revenues were 42% in both 2001 and 2000. The increase in total sales and client
service expenses is attributable to the cost of a larger field sales and
services organization and marketing of new software solutions.

Software Development

- Software development expenses include salaries,
documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and
amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software
development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2001
and 2000 were $113,872,000 and $90,694,000, respectively. These amounts
exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $37,828,000 and
$30,982,000 for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

General and Administrative

- General and administrative expenses include
salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities,
communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of
total revenues were 7% in both 2001 and 2000.

Write-off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

– Write-off of
acquired in-process research and development includes expenses resulting from
the acquisitions of CITATION Computer Systems, Inc. and ADAC Healthcare
Information Systems, Inc. in 2000.

Write-down of Intangible Assets

– Write-down of intangible results from the
decision to discontinue a portion of the Health Network Ventures, Inc. business
as more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Expense, Net

-

Interest income was $2,896,000 in 2001 compared to
$3,645,000 in 2000. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in invested
cash. Interest expense was $7,321,000 in 2001 compared to $7,316,000 in 2000.

Other Income, Net —

Other revenues decreased to $182,000 in 2001 from
$3,669,000 in 2000. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space
leased to third parties and other investment revenues. This decrease was due
to a decrease in other investment revenue.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment –

On December 12, 2000, the Company sold
4,273,509 shares of WebMD for $25,641,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded
an investment loss of $24,539,000, net of $13,923,000 of tax, as a result of
the sale.

Impairment of Investment —

The Company’s policy is to review declines in fair
value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than
temporary. As a result of that policy, during the second quarter of 2001, the
Company recorded a write-down of its investment in WebMD from $15.00 to $5.79.
Accordingly, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of $81,419,000, net of
$46,197,000 in tax.



Gain on Software License Settlement —

On June 18, 2001, the Company reached an
agreement with WebMD Corporation regarding certain performance metrics related
to specified levels of physician usage arising out of the original license
transaction between the Company and WebMD. Under the agreement, the Company
received 2,000,000 shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11,580,000, in exchange
for $432,000 in cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to the Company
by WebMD. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized a gain of
$4,836,000, net of $2,744,000 of tax.

Realized Gain on Exchange of Stock –

On February 13, 2000, CareInsite entered
into an agreement to merge with WebMD. The merger of CareInsite and WebMD
(“Merger”) closed on September 12, 2000. Prior to the Merger, the carrying
value of the CareInsite stock was $6.22 per share, the market price of WebMD on
September 12, 2000 was $15.00 per share. Upon the exchange of CareInsite stock
for WebMD stock, the Company recorded an investment gain of $120,362,000, net
of $68,292,000 of tax, as a result of the exchange.

Income Taxes

- The Company’s effective tax rate was a benefit of 33% in 2001
and an expense of 39% in 2000. The benefit is a result of the loss on the
WebMD shares and other permanent differences.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had total cash and cash equivalents of $142,543,000 at the end of
2002 and working capital of $282,135,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents
of $107,536,000 at the end of 2001 and working capital of $189,488,000.

The Company generated cash of $36,850,000, $64,838,000 and $53,313,000 from
operations in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash flow from operations
decreased in 2002 due primarily to a $31,200,000 tax payment related to the
sale of shares of WebMD. Cash flow from operations increased in 2001 and
2000, due primarily to the increase in net earnings before noncash charges,
increased collection of receivables, improved payment terms and record level of
conversions.

Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capitalized software
development costs of $49,984,000 and $37,828,000 and purchases of capital
equipment, land and buildings of $59,699,000 and $25,722,000 in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company also completed acquisitions of businesses for
$26,016,000 and $4,045,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company had
proceeds of $95,134,000 from the sale of shares of WebMD in 2002.

Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring
cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 22% in 2002, 2001 and
2000, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of
installed systems grows.

On December 20, 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of
debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated December 15, 2002. The Series A Senior
Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in three equal
annual installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes,
with a $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual
installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the bank loan agreement and will be used for general
corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed
charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s
ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was
in compliance with all covenants at December 28, 2002.

The Company’s liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and
timing of the Company’s revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the
amounts the Company invests in software development, acquisitions and capital
expenditures. The Company has a loan agreement with a bank that provides for a
current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes. In June 2002,
the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured
revolving credit agreement with a group of banks led by U.S. Bank. The new
credit facility increased the amount the Company may borrow from $45,000,000 to
$90,000,000. The fee rate on the new facility is approximately the same as the
prior facility. The revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly
payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a
rate based on prime (4.25% at December 28, 2002) or LIBOR



(1.42% at December
28, 2002) plus 2%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1% if certain net
worth ratios are maintained. At December 28, 2002, the Company had no
outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for
working capital purposes. The agreement contains certain net worth, current
ratio and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on
 the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A
commitment fee of 1/2% or 3/10% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the
revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31,
2005. The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash
generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash
requirements during 2003.

On April 15, 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of
debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated April 1, 1999. The Series A Senior
Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in five equal
annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a
$40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual
installments beginning April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the
Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds will be used
for capital improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge
coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability
to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 28, 2002.

At December 28, 2002, the Company was committed to spending approximately
$63,000,000 under construction contracts for two new buildings at its North
Kansas City headquarters complex. At December 28, 2002, the Company had spent
$26,464,000. The construction will be financed by the Company’s cash position,
cash generated from operations and if necessary the line of credit.

The following table represents a summary of the Company’s contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of December 28, 2002, except those
arising in the ordinary course.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued SFAS
No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”). The
Company is required to adopt SFAS 143 effective December 28, 2002. In July
2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 143
or 146 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these accounting
standards.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are
critical to understanding the Company’s historical and future performance, as
these policies affect the reported amount of revenue



and other significant
areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. These significant
accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, other
than temporary declines in the market value of investments, allowance for
doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These policies and
the Company’s procedures related to these policies are described in detail
below and under specific areas within the Discussion and Analysis of the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, Note 1 to the accompanying
financial statements further expands upon the Company’s accounting
policies.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical financial and
administrative information systems and solutions. The components of the system
sales revenues are the licensing of computer software, installation,
subscription content and the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed
software. The components of support, maintenance and service revenues are
software support and hardware maintenance, remote hosting and outsourcing,
training, consulting and implementation services.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement
of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP
No. 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” SOP No 97-2, as amended,
generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving
multiple-elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair
values of those elements. Revenue from multiple-element software arrangements
is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, revenue is
recognized in a multiple-element arrangement when Company-specific objective
evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the
arrangement (i.e. professional services, software support, hardware
maintenance, hardware and sublicensed software), but does not exist for one or
more of the delivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. software solutions).
The Company allocates revenue to each element in a multiple-element arrangement
based on the element’s respective fair value, with the fair value determined by
the price charged when that element is sold separately. Specifically, the
Company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement
based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to clients, professional
services portion of the arrangement, other than installation services, based on
hourly rates which the Company charges for these services when sold apart from
a software license, and the hardware and sublicensed software based on the
prices for these elements when they are sold separately from the software. If
evidence of the fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements
of a license agreement, the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is
deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be
established.

Inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management
estimates and judgments, which influence the timing and the amount of revenue
recognition. The Company provides several models for the procurement of its
clinical, financial and administrative information systems. The predominant
method is a perpetual software license agreement, project-related installation
services, implementation and consulting services, computer hardware and
sublicensed software and software support. For those arrangements involving
the use of services, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of
accounting, following the guidance in the AICPA Statement of Position No. 81-1
(SOP 81-1),

Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts.

The Company provides installation services, which include project-scoping
services, conducting pre-installation audits and creating initial environments.
Because installation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality
of the software, software license and installation services fees are recognized
over the software installation period using output measures which reflect
direct labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at
completion of installation, typically a three-to-six month process.

The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include
consulting activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard
installation services. These services vary depending on the scope and
complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may include
additional database consulting, system configuration, project management,
testing assistance, network consulting and post conversion review services.
Implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed



to be essential
to the functionality of the software, and thus do not impact the timing of the
software license recognition, unless software license fees are tied to
implementation milestones. In those instances, the portion of the software
license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred until the
related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and
non-forfeitable. Implementation fees are recognized over the service period,
which may extend from six months to three years.

Remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long-term
arrangements generally over periods of five to 10 years. Revenues from these
arrangements are recognized as the services are performed.

Software maintenance fees are marketed under annual and multi-year arrangements
and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contracted maintenance term.
Hardware maintenance revenues are billed and recognized monthly over the
contracted maintenance term.

Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and
multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms.

Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized upon delivery
to the client.

The Company also offers its solutions on an application service provider
(“ASP”) or a term license basis, making available Company software
functionality on a remote processing basis from the Company’s data centers.
The data centers provide system and administrative support as well as
processing services. Revenue on software and services provided on an ASP or
term license basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the
contract. The Company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of
third-party costs and direct software installation and implementation costs.
These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.

In limited cases where the Company has contractually agreed to develop new or
customized software code for a client, the Company utilizes percentage of
completion accounting in accordance with SOP 81-1.

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, maintenance and
other services for which payment has been received and for which the service
has not yet been performed. Long-term deferred revenue, at December 29, 2001,
represents amounts received from license fees, maintenance and other services
to be earned or provided beginning in periods on or after December 29, 2002.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed
until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a
detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are
capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net
realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and
expected future revenue for each software solutions with minimum annual
amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated
economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized
costs over five years.

The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large
information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators,
internet-based start-up companies and others specializing in the health care
industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the
health care information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new
product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and
requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less
valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

Investments

The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities, which have
readily determinable fair values as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income.



For realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
investments, the Company utilizes the specific identification method as the
basis to determine cost. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates
over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the
equity method.

The Company has certain other minority equity investments in non-publicly
traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the
Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over these companies. The balance of these
investments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $876,000 and
$18,212,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the
market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage
at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be
significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of
these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and
makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such
declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the
individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the
amount of the write-down is included in earnings

Concentrations

Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments, are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority
of the Company’s cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency
Securities, short-term marketable securities and overnight repurchase
agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance
provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon
demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.

Substantially all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks,
hospitals and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse
macro-economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially
adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access to certain software and
hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The
inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could
affect future results.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally
does not require collateral from its clients. The Company maintains an
allowance for potential losses on a specific identification basis and based on
historical experience and management’s judgments.

Goodwill

Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are
no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there
is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit,
where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company
completed its review of the Company’s goodwill values in the second quarter of
2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising
from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to
declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was
a supply chain re-engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to
reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning
of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the
fair value of the reporting units. The Company completed three acquisitions
subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately, $36.7 million of
goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. For the years
ended 2001 and 2000, earnings included $1,758,000 and $1,015,000 of
amortization of goodwill, net of tax, respectively. Goodwill amounted to
$45,938,000 and $23,879,000 at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,
respectively.



Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business

Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders in which this
report is made a part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, communications to shareholders, press
releases and oral statements made by representatives of the Company that are
not historical in nature, or that state the Company’s or management’s
intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may
constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, such as “could,” “should,” “will,” “will be,”
“will lead,” “will assist,” “intended,” “continue,” “believe,” “may,” “expect,”
“hope,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “forecast,” “plan,” or “estimate” or variations
thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual
results, financial condition or business, could differ materially from those
expressed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed
below as well as those discussed elsewhere in reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Other unforeseen factors not identified herein could
also have such an effect. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or
revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the
occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results,
financial condition or business over time.

Quarterly Operating Results May Vary

—  The Company’s quarterly operating
results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods.
Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including
accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities (including, but not
limited to, any accounting policy change concerning the expensing of options),
demand for the Company’s software solutions and services, the Company’s long
sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycle for these
larger, more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this
section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of health care industry
trends and the market for the Company’s

Cerner Millennium

solutions, a large
percentage of the Company’s revenues are generated by the sale and installation
of larger, more complex and costlier systems. The sales process for these
systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and
commitment of capital and other resources by the client. The sale may be
subject to delays due to clients’ internal budgets and procedures for approving
large capital expenditures and by competing needs for other capital
expenditures and deploying new technologies or personnel resources. Delays in
the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a
significant impact on the Company’s anticipated quarterly revenues and
consequently its earnings, since a significant percentage of the Company’s
expenses are relatively fixed.

These larger, more complex and costlier systems are installed and implemented
over time periods ranging from approximately one month to three years and may
involve significant efforts both by the Company and the client. The Company
recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the
amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the Company’s and the
client’s ability to meet these project milestones. Delays in meeting these
milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of
these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter
to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations
for a particular quarter. In addition, support payments by clients for the
Company’s solutions generally do not commence until the solution is in use.

The Company’s revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the
first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year,
primarily as a result of the clients’ year-end efforts to make all final
capital expenditures for the current year.

Stock Price May Be Volatile

—  The trading price of the Company’s common stock
may be volatile. The market for the Company’s common stock may experience
significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors
including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results,
rumors about the Company’s performance or software solutions, changes in
expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of
securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, health care reform
measures, client relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities



markets in general and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s
control. As a matter of policy, the Company does not generally comment on
rumors.

Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, health
care and high technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme
volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of
particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may
adversely affect the trading price of the Company’s common stock, regardless of
actual operating performance.

Market Risk of Investments

— The Company accounts for its investments in equity
securities, which have readily determinable fair values as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates
over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the
equity method. Investments in other equity securities are reported at cost.
The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such
declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the
individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the
amount of the write-down is included in earnings.

The Company also has certain other minority equity investments in non-publicly
traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the
Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over these companies. The carrying value of
these investments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $876,000 and
$18,212,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the
market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage
at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be
significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of
these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and
makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

At December 28, 2002, marketable securities (which consist of money market and
commercial paper) of the Company were recorded at cost, which approximates fair
value of approximately $143 million, with an overall average return of
approximately 2.3% and an overall weighted maturity of less than 90 days. The
marketable securities held by the Company are not subject to significant price
risk as a result of the short-term nature of the investments.

The Company has limited exposure to material future earnings or cash flow
exposures from changes in interest rates on long-term debt since substantially
all of its long-term debt is at a fixed rate. The Company also had no
borrowings outstanding under its working capital line of credit, which has a
variable interest rate based on prime (4.25% at December 28, 2002) or LIBOR
(1.42% at December 28, 2002) plus 2%. To date, the Company has not entered
into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

The Company conducts business in several foreign jurisdictions. However, the
business transacted is in the local functional currency and the Company does
not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains
or losses. All other business transactions are in U.S. dollars. To date, the
Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage
foreign currency risk.

Changes in the Health Care Industry

— The health care industry is highly
regulated and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory
influences. For example, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-32)
contains significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid and began to have its
initial impact in 1998 due to limitations on reimbursement, resulting cost
containment initiatives, and effects on pricing and demand for capital
intensive systems. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) will have a direct impact on the health care
industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets and
necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of
patient health information. These factors affect the purchasing practices and
operation of health care organizations. Federal and state legislatures have
periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. health care system
at both the federal and state level and to change health care financing and
reimbursement systems. These programs may contain proposals to increase
governmental involvement in health care, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise
change the environment in which health care industry participants operate.
Health care industry participants may



respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions,
including investments in the Company’s software solutions and services.

Many health care providers are consolidating to create integrated health care
delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use
their market power to negotiate price reductions for the Company’s software
solutions and services. As the health care industry consolidates, the
Company’s client base could be eroded, competition for clients could become
more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater.

Significant Competition

— The market for health care information systems is
intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological
change. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in this
market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution
offerings, the stability of the information systems provider, the features and
capabilities of the information systems, the ongoing support for the system and
the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions.

Certain of the Company’s competitors have greater financial, technical, product
development, marketing and other resources than the Company and some of its
competitors offer software solutions that it does not offer. The Company’s
principal existing competitors include GE Medical Systems, Siemens Medical
Solutions Health Services Corporation, IDX Systems Corporation, McKesson
Corporation, Eclipsys Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc.
(“Meditech”) and Epic Systems Corporation, each of which offers a suite of
software solutions that compete with many of the Company’s software solutions
and services. There are other competitors that offer a more limited number of
competing software solutions.

In addition, the Company expects that major software information systems
companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system
integrators, internet-based start-up companies and others specializing in the
health care industry may offer competitive software/solutions or services. The
pace of change in the health care information systems market is rapid and there
are frequent new software solution introductions, software solution
enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result,
the Company’s success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with
technological change and to introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis,
new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client
requirements and achieve market acceptance.

Proprietary Technology May Be Subjected to Infringement Claims or May Be
Infringed Upon — The Company relies upon a combination of license agreements,
confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure agreements and technical
measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of its proprietary
information. The Company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to
protect its intellectual property. The Company has initiated a patent program
but currently has a very limited patent portfolio. As a result, the Company
may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual
property.

In addition, the Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement
claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software
solutions and services overlaps with competitive offerings. These claims, even
if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If the Company becomes
liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, it
could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop
noninfringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the software
solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property.

Government Regulation

— The United States Food and Drug Administration (the
“FDA”) has declared that software products intended for the maintenance of data
used in making decisions regarding the suitability of blood donors and the
release of blood or blood components for transfusion are medical devices under
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“Act”) and amendments to the Act. As
a consequence, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with
regard to its blood bank software. If other of the Company’s software
solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, the
Company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and
post-marketing requirements including pre-market notification clearance prior
to marketing. Complying with these FDA regulations



would be time consuming and expensive. It is possible that the FDA may become
more active in regulating computer software that is used in health care.

Following an inspection by the FDA in March of 1998, the Company received a
Form FDA 483 (Notice of Inspectional Observations) alleging non-compliance with
certain aspects of FDA’s Quality System Regulation with respect to the
Company’s PathNet HNAC Blood Bank Transfusion and Donor products (the “Blood
Bank Products”). The Company subsequently received a Warning Letter, dated
April 29, 1998, as a result of the same inspection. The Company responded
promptly to the FDA and undertook a number of actions in response to the Form
483 and Warning Letter including an audit by a third party of the Company’s
Blood Bank Products and improvements to Cerner’s Quality System. A copy of the
third party audit was submitted to the FDA in October of 1998 and, at the
request of the FDA, additional information and clarification were submitted to
the FDA in January of 1999.

There can be no assurance, however, that the Company’s actions taken in
response to the Form 483 and Warning Letter will be deemed adequate by the FDA
or that additional actions on behalf of the Company will not be required. In
addition, the Company remains subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can
be no assurances that the Company will not be required to undertake additional
actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory
requirements. Any failure by the Company to comply with the Act and any other
applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its software
solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures,
injunctions, civil fines and/or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Product Related Liabilities

— Many of the Company’s software solutions provide
data for use by health care providers in providing care to patients. Although
no such claims have been brought against the Company to date regarding injuries
related to the use of its software solutions, such claims may be made in the
future. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage in
an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business, there can be no
assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought
in the future, prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to
remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim brought
against the Company, which is uninsured, or under-insured could materially harm
its business, results of operations or financial condition.

System Errors and Warranties

— The Company’s systems, particularly the

Cerner
Millennium

versions, are very complex. As with complex systems offered by
others, the Company’s systems may contain errors, especially when first
introduced. Although the Company conducts extensive testing, it has discovered
software errors in its software solutions after their introduction. The
Company’s systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical
information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users
of the Company software solutions have a greater sensitivity to system errors
than the market for software products generally. The Company’s agreements with
its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other
matters. Failure of a client’s system to meet these criteria could constitute
a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the
contract and obtain a refund and/or damages, or could require the Company to
incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria. The
Company’s contracts with its clients generally limit the Company’s liability
arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain
jurisdictions or circumstances.

Anti-Takeover Defenses

— The Company’s charter, bylaws, shareholders’ rights
plan and certain provisions of Delaware law contain certain provisions that may
have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company. Such
provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the
Company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the Board of Directors in
connection with any such transaction. These provisions include (a) a Board of
Directors that is staggered into three classes to serve staggered three-year
terms, (b) blank check preferred stock, (c) supermajority voting provisions,
(d) inability of shareholders to act by written consent or call a special
meeting, (e) limitations on the ability of shareholders to nominate directors
or make proposals at shareholder meetings and (f) triggering the exercisability
of stock purchase rights on a discriminatory basis, which may invoke extensive
economic and voting dilution of a potential acquirer if its beneficial
ownership of the Company’s



common stock exceeds a specified threshold. Certain
of these provisions may discourage a future
acquisition of the Company not approved by the Board of Directors in which
shareholders might receive a premium value for their shares.

Risks Associated with the Company’s Global Operations

– The Company markets,
sells and services its software solutions globally. The Company has
established offices around the world, including in North America, Europe and in
the Asia Pacific region. The Company will continue to expand its global
operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require
significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful
direct and indirect global sales and support channels. In some countries, the
Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with
local partners. There is a risk that the Company may sometimes choose the
wrong partner. For these reasons, the Company may not be able to maintain or
increase global market demand for its software solutions.

Global operations are subject to inherent risks, and the Company’s future
results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing
factors. These include:

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cerner
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2002.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cerner Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 28, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” on December 30, 2001.

Management’s Report

The management of Cerner Corporation is responsible for the consolidated
financial statements and all other information presented in this report. The
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America appropriate to
the circumstances, and, therefore, included in the financial statements are
certain amounts based on management’s informed estimates and judgments. Other
financial information in this report is consistent with that in the
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have
been audited by Cerner Corporation’s independent certified public accountants
and have been reviewed by the audit committee of the Board of Directors.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Cerner Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries
(the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Nature of Operations

- The Company designs, develops, markets, installs,
hosts and supports software information technology and content solutions for
healthcare organizations and consumers. The Company also implements these
solutions as individual, combined or enterprise-wide systems.

(c)

Revenue Recognition

- Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of
clinical, financial and administrative information systems and solutions. The
components of these revenues are the licensing of computer software, software
support and hardware maintenance, remote hosting and outsourcing, training,
installation, consulting and implementation services, subscription content, and
the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed software.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement
of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP
No. 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”. SOP No 97-2, as amended,
generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple
elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of
those elements. Revenue from multiple-element software arrangements is
recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, revenue is
recognized in a multiple element arrangement when Company-specific objective
evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the
arrangement (i.e. professional services, software support, hardware maintenance
and sublicensed software), but does not exist for one or more of the delivered
elements in the arrangement (i.e. software solutions). The Company allocates
revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its
respective fair value, with the fair value determined by the price charged when
that element is sold separately. Specifically, the Company determines the fair
value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price
of the maintenance charged to clients, professional services portion of the
arrangement, other than installation services, based on hourly rates which the
Company charges for these services when sold apart from a software license, and
the hardware and sublicense software based on the prices for these elements
when they are sold separate from the software. If evidence of the fair value
cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement, the
entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until these elements
have been delivered or objective evidence can be established.

Inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management
estimates and judgments, which influence the timing and the amount of revenue
recognition. The Company provides several models for the procurement of its
clinical and financial information systems. The predominant method is a
perpetual software license agreement, project related installation services,
implementation and consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed
software, and software support. For those arrangements involving the use of
services, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting,
following the guidance in the AICPA Statement of Position No. 81-1 (SOP 81-1),

Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts.

The Company provides installation services, which include project scoping
services, conducting pre-installation audit, and creating initial environments.
Because installation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality
of the software, software license and installation services fees are recognized
over the software installation period using output measures which reflect
direct labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at
completion of installation, typically a three to six month process.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include
consulting activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard
installation services. These services vary depending on the scope and
complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may include
additional database consulting, system configuration, project management,
testing assistance, network consulting and post conversion review services.
Implementation and consulting services are generally not deemed to be essential
to the functionality of the software, and, thus, do not impact the timing of
the software license recognition, unless software license fees are tied to
implementation milestones. In those instances, the portion of the software
license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred until the related
milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non-forfeitable.
Implementation fees are recognized over the service period, which may extend
from six months to three years.

Remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long-term
arrangements generally over periods of 5 to 10 years. Revenues from these
arrangements are recognized as the services are performed.

Software maintenance fees are marketed under annual and multi-year arrangements
and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contracted maintenance term.
Hardware maintenance revenues are billed and recognized monthly over the
contracted maintenance term.

Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and
multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms.

Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized upon delivery
to the client.

The Company also offers its software solutions on an application service
provider (“ASP”) or term license basis, making available Company software
functionality on a remote processing basis from the Company’s data centers.
The data centers provide system and administrative support as well as
processing services. Revenue on software and services provided on an ASP or
term license basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the
contract. The Company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of third
party costs and direct software installation and implementation costs. These
costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.

In limited cases where the Company contractually agrees to develop new or
customized software code for a client, the Company will utilize percentage of
completion accounting in accordance with SOP 81-1.

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, maintenance and
other services for which payment has been received and for which the service
has not yet been performed. Long-term deferred revenue, at December 29, 2001,
represents amounts received from license fees, maintenance and other services
to be earned or provided beginning in periods on or after December 29, 2002.

The Company incurs out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its client service
activities, which are reimbursed by its clients. The amounts of
“out-of-pocket” expenses and equal amounts of related reimbursements were
$28,410,000, $18,379,000 and $13,821,000 for the years ended December 28,
2002, December 29, 2001, and December 30, 2000, respectively. These amounts
have been reclassified from sales and client service expense to revenue and
cost of revenues. The Company then reclassified these amounts from revenue and
cost of revenues to other income and expense.

(d)

Fiscal Year

- The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
December 31. Fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted of 52 weeks each. All
references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements
represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(e)

Software Development Costs

- Costs incurred internally in creating
computer software products are expensed until technological feasibility has
been established upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all
software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the
lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are
amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each product with
minimum annual amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the
estimated economic life of the product. The Company is amortizing capitalized
costs over five years. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company capitalized
$49,984,000, $37,828,000 and $30,982,000, respectively, of total software
development costs of $149,985,000, $113,872,000, and $90,694,000, respectively.
Amortization expense of capitalized software development costs in 2002, 2001,
and 2000 was $29,619,000, $24,142,000, and $18,713,000, respectively, and
accumulated amortization was $130,172,000, $100,553,000, and $76,411,000,
respectively.

The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large
information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators,
internet-based start-up companies and others specializing in the healthcare
industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the
healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new
product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and
requirements. As a result, the capitalized software may become less valuable
or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

(f)

Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of short-term marketable
securities with original maturities less than ninety days.

(g)

Investments

– The Company accounts for its investments in equity
securities, which have readily determinable fair values as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. For realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
investments, the Company utilizes the specific identification method as the
basis to determine cost. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates
over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the
equity method.

The Company also has certain other minority equity investments in non-publicly
traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the
Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over these companies. The carrying value of
these investments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $876,000 and
$18,212,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the
market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage
at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be
significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of
these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and
makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such
declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the
individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the
amount of the write-down is included in earnings.

(h)

Inventory

- Inventory consists primarily of computer hardware and
sub-licensed software held for resale and is recorded at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

(i)

Property and Equipment

- Property, equipment and leasehold improvements
are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using
the straight-line method over periods of 5 to 39 years. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is computed using a straight-line method over the lease
terms, which range from periods of two to twelve years.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(j)

Earnings per Common Share

– Basic earnings per share (EPS) excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or
other contracts to issue stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of
the Company. A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
basic and diluted per-share computations is as follows:

(In thousands, except per share data)

Options to purchase 2,390,000, 299,000, and 521,000 shares of common stock at
per share prices ranging from $43.13 to $574.82, $48.19 to $574.82, and $35.88
to $84.07, were outstanding at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because
the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
common shares. Additionally, all options were excluded from the 2001 diluted
earnings per share computations as the effect of their inclusion would have
been anti-dilutive on the loss per share calculation.

(k)

Foreign Currency

- Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are
translated into dollars at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the year. The net
exchange differences resulting from these translations are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of
earnings. The net gain (loss) resulting from foreign currency transactions was
($1,955,000), $23,813, and ($518,000) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(l)

Income Taxes

- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(m)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets —

On December 30, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (“SFAS 144”), which supersedes certain provisions of APB Opinion No. 30
“Reporting the Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions” and supercedes SFAS No. 121 “Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.”
There was not a cumulative transition adjustment upon adoption. In accordance
with SFAS 144, the Company evaluates long-lived assets, including intangible
assets other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that
asset. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the
carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.

(n)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets –

Effective December 30, 2001, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are
evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator.
All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an
impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its review of the
Company’s goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this
review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of
Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in
this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re-engineering
consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair
value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a
discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting
units. The Company’s intangible assets, other than goodwill or intangible
assets with indefinite lives, are all subject to amortization and are
summarized as follows:

(In thousands, except per share data)

(o)

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

(p)

Segment Reporting

- In June of 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS No.
131), “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
SFAS No. 131 establishes annual and interim reporting standards for operating
segments of a company. It also requires entity-wide disclosures about the
products and services an entity provides, the material countries in which it
holds assets and reports revenues, and its major customers. The Company is not
organized by multiple operating segments for the purpose of making operating
decisions or assessing performance. Accordingly, the Company operates in one
operating segment and reports only certain enterprise-wide disclosures.

(q)

Concentrations

– Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, are held at three major U.S. financial
institutions. The majority of the Company’s cash equivalents consist of U.S.
Government Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable securities, and
overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the
amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be
redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Substantially all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks,
hospitals, and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse
macro-economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially
adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access to certain software and
hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The
inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could
affect future results.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally
does not require collateral from its clients. The Company maintains an
allowance for potential losses on a specific identification basis and based on
historical experience and management’s judgments. The Company’s allowance for
doubtful accounts as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $8,746,000

Accounting for Stock Options —

The Company applies the
intrinsic-value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, as interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25,” issued in March 2000, to account for its fixed–plan stock
options. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of
grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
exercise price. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” established accounting and
disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No. 123, the
Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 123. The following is a reconciliation of reported net earnings
(loss) to adjusted net earnings (loss) had the Company recorded compensation
expense based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under
SFAS 123 for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000.

(In thousands, except per share data)

Pro forma net earnings reflect only options granted since January 1, 1995.
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation expense for stock
options under FAS 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net earnings amounts
presented above, because compensation cost is reflected over the options’
vesting period of ten years for these options. Compensation expense for
options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not considered.

Recent Accounting Pronoucements

- In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 143 “Accounting for Assets Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS 143”). SFAS 143
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirements costs. SFAS 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or normal use of the assets. SFAS 143 requires that the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the
period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made. The fair value fo the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is expensed over the life
of the asset. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 143 effective December 28,
2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 to have a material
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 addresses the recognition, measurement and
reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities (i.e.,
restructuring activities), including costs related to terminating a contract
that is not a capital lease and termination benefits due to employees who are
involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one-time benefit arrangement.

SFAS 146 supersedes EITF 94-3 and EITF 88-10 and therefore prohibits
recognition of a liability based solely on an entity’s commitment to a plan to
exit an activity. SFAS 146 requires that: (i) liabilities associated with exit
and disposal activities be measured at fair value and changes in the fair value
of the liability at each reporting period be measured using an interest
allocation approach; (ii) one-time termination benefits be expensed at the date
the entity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future
service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future
service period; (iii) liabilities to terminate a contract be recorded at fair
value when the contract is terminated; (iv) liabilities related to an existing
operating lease/contract, unless terminated, be recorded at fair value, less
estimated sublease income, and measured when the contract does not have any
future economic benefit to the entity (i.e. the entity ceases to utilize the
rights conveyed by the contract); and, (v) all other costs related to an exit
or disposal activity be expensed as incurred.

SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December
31, 2002. Retroactive application of SFAS 146 is prohibited and, accordingly,
liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of SFAS 146 must
continue to be accounted for in accordance with EITF 94-3; EITF 88-10 or other
applicable preexisting guidance. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS 146 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flow.

2 Business Acquisitions

During the three years ended December 28, 2002, the Company completed eight
acquisitions, which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for any of the
acquisitions because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to the
Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The results of
operations of each acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated
statement of operations from the date of each acquisition.

The amounts allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPRD)
were determined through established valuation techniques in the software
industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility
had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. Research and
development costs to bring the products from the acquired companies to
technological feasibility, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

to have a material impact on the Company’s future results of operations or cash
flows. Amounts allocated to intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis
over five to seven years. Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for
impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill
is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test
based on fair value. Amounts allocated to software are amortized based on
current and expected future revenues for each product with minimum annual
amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated
economic life of the product. The IPRD amounts in the table below are
reflected as one-time charges to earnings at the date of acquisition.

A summary of the Company’s significant purchase acquisitions for the three
years ended December 28, 2002, is included in the following table (in millions,
except share amounts):

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(a)  The acquired in-process research and development is related to the PACS
(Picture Archiving and Communications Systems) product. The PACS product, when
integrated with the Company’s radiology information system, provides a
comprehensive radiology solution, from automating and streamlining the
information workflow to complete image management. PACS was approximately 86%
complete at the time of the acquisition. When ADAC HCIS was acquired,
management projected that PACS would be completed in 3 months at an estimated
cost of $150,000. The risks associated with PACS are like any other software
development project and include changes in technology and competition. The
PACS project was valued using the income approach with the following
assumptions: material net cash inflows were expected to commence in 2001; no
material changes from historical pricing, margins, or expense levels were
anticipated; and, a 20% risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the
estimated net cash flows. PACS was complete at the end of 2001.

(b)  The acquired in-process research and development is related to CITATION’s
enhanced versions of the C-LAB and C-COM products. C-LAB addresses the
complex information needs of the laboratory’s general lab, microbiology,
anatomical pathology and blood bank departments with a Windows NT client server
solution. C-LAB was approximately 68% complete at the time of the acquisition.
When CITATION was acquired, management projected that C-LAB would be completed
in 6-9 months at an estimated cost of $700,000. The risks associated with
C-LAB are like any other software development project and include changes in
technology and competition. The C-LAB project was valued using the income
approach with the following assumptions: material net cash inflows were
expected to commence in 2001; no material changes from historical pricing,
margins, or expense levels were anticipated; and, a 20% risk adjusted discount
rate was applied to the estimated net cash flows. C-LAB was complete at the
end of 2002. C-COM is also designed for a Windows NT client server user and
works with other information systems in healthcare facilities by providing a
central data repository for clinical orders and results. It then allows for
routing of the patient information to all care-providing centers throughout the
healthcare enterprise. C-COM was approximately 75% complete at the time of the
acquisition. When CITATION was acquired, management projected that C-COM would
be completed in 3-6 months at an estimated cost of $500,000. The risks
associated with C-COM are like any other software development project and
include changes in technology and competition. The C-COM project was valued
using the income approach with the following assumptions: material net cash
inflows were expected to commence in 2001; no material changes from historical
pricing, margins, or expense levels are anticipated; and, a 20% risk adjusted
discount rate was applied to the estimated net cash flows. C-COM was complete
at the end of 2001.

(c)  Subsequent to the acquisition of Health Network Ventures, Inc., the
Company determined that it would discontinue the portion of the business
focused on individual physician practice connectivity and transaction
processing. As a result of this decision, the Company recorded a charge in the
second quarter of 2000 in the amount of $6,687,000 related to a write-down of
intangible assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand
and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain
re-engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this
goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax and is reflected as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of
2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair
value of the reporting units.

(f)  The following goodwill amounts are deductible for tax purposes:

APACHE Medical Systems

5,000,000

ADAC Healthcare Information Systems, Inc.

(g)  The Company will not recognize revenues related to the utilization of the
$8.5 million in software credits as the Company considered the exchange of
software credits for Zynx content as an exchange of similar productive assets,
which will be accounted for at carrying value. In the event the software
credits are not utilized over the next five years, the Company will make
additional cash payments of up to $7.5 million depending on the level of the
credits used. These additional payments, if made, will result in additional
goodwill.

3 Receivables

Receivables consist of accounts receivable and contracts receivable. Accounts
receivable represent recorded revenues that have been billed. Contracts
receivable represent recorded revenues that are billable by the Company at
future dates under the terms of a contract with a client. Billings and other
consideration received on contracts in excess of related revenues recognized
under the percentage-of-completion method are recorded as deferred revenue. A
summary of receivables is as follows:

Substantially all receivables are derived from sales and related support and
maintenance of the Company’s clinical and financial information systems to
healthcare providers located throughout the United States and in certain
foreign countries. Included in receivables at the end of 2002 and 2001 are
amounts due from healthcare providers located in foreign countries of
$23,589,000, and $19,611,000, respectively. Consolidated revenues include
foreign sales of $29,412,000, $22,350,000, and $25,815,000, during 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Consolidated long-lived assets at the end of 2002, and
2001, include foreign long-lived assets of $1,120,000, and $776,000,
respectively. Revenues and long-lived assets from any one foreign country are
not material.

The Company provides an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts based
upon historical experience and management’s judgment. At the end of 2002, and
2001 the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts was $8,746,000, and
$6,880,000, respectively.

On February 13, 2000 CareInsite entered into an agreement to merge with WebMD.
The merger of CareInsite and WebMD (“Merger”) closed on September 12, 2000.
Prior to the merger, the carrying value of the CareInsite stock was $6.22 per
share, and the market price of WebMD on September 12, 2000 was $15.00 per
share. Upon the exchange of CareInsite stock for WebMD stock, the Company
recorded an investment gain of $120,362,000, net of $68,292,000 of tax, as a
result of the exchange.

On December 12, 2000, the Company sold 4,273,509 shares of WebMD for
$25,641,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment loss of
$24,539,000, net of $13,923,000 of tax, as a result of the sale.

On June 18, 2001 the Company reached an agreement with WebMD regarding certain
performance metrics related to specified levels of physician usage arising out
of the original license transaction between the Company and CareInsite, which
has been merged into WebMD. Under the agreement, the Company received
2,000,000 shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11,580,000, in exchange for
$432,000 in cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to the Company
by WebMD. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized a gain of
$4,836,000, net of $2,744,000 in tax, in gain on software license settlement in
the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company’s policy is
to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for
declines that may be other than temporary. As a result of this policy, during
the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a write-down of its investment
in WebMD from $15.00 per share to $5.79 per share. Accordingly, the Company
recognized a charge to earnings of $81,419,000, net of $46,197,000 in tax.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold its remaining 14,820,527 shares
of WebMD for $90,119,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain
of $2,736,000, net of



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

$1,572,000 in tax, as a result of the sale. Since the shares sold had a lower
income tax basis, the sale resulted in the transfer of approximately
$29,638,000 of deferred tax liabilities to income taxes payable in the second
quarter of 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company made a cash payment
of tax in the amount of $31,200,000 related to the investment gain.

In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an
exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The
warrants were scheduled to expire on January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the
Company sold 1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000. Accordingly, the
Company recorded an investment gain of $527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a
result of the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the shares.

The Company has certain other minority equity investments in non-publicly
traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the
Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability
to exercise significant influence over these companies. The balance of these
investments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $876,000 and
$18,212,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the
market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage
at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be
significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of
these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and
makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary. Based on
events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge
of $6,281,000, net of tax of $3,623,000, for the impairment of various
investments of non-publicly traded securities. The charge is primarily related
to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Company’s investment in
Protocare, Inc, a non-publicly traded company.

6 Indebtedness

On December 20, 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of
debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated December 15, 2002. The Series A Senior
Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in three equal
installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a
$39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in 4 equal annual
installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the credit facility and for general corporate
purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge
coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability
to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 28, 2002.

In June 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an
unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This new
agreement provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital
purposes. The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires
monthly payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Company’s option
at a rate based on prime (4.25% at December 28, 2002) or LIBOR (1.42% at
December 28, 2002) plus 2%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1% if
certain net worth ratios are maintained. At December 28, 2002, the Company no
outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for
working capital purposes. The agreement contains certain net worth, current
ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on
the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends.
A commitment fee of 1/2% or 3/10% is payable quarterly based on the usage of
the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31,
2005.

On April 15, 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of
debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated April 1, 1999. The Series A Senior
Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in five equal
annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a
$40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual
installments beginning April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the
Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds will be used
for capital improvements and



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The note agreement contains certain
net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides
certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell
assets, and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at
December 28, 2002.

The Company also has capital lease obligations and other notes payable
amounting to $838,000, payable over the next two years.

The aggregate maturities for the Company’s long-term debt is as follows (in

8 Stock Options, Warrants and Equity

At the end of 2002 and 2001, the Company had 1,000,000 shares of authorized but
unissued preferred stock, $.01 par value.

At December 28, 2002, the Company had five fixed stock option plans. Under
Stock Option Plan B, the Company could grant to associates options to purchase
up to 5,600,000 shares of common stock through November 30, 1993. The options
are exercisable at the fair market value on the date of grant for a period
determined by the Board of Directors (not more than ten years from the date
granted). The options contain restrictions as to transferability and
exercisability after termination of employment.

Under Stock Option Plan C, the Company is authorized to grant to associates
options to purchase up to 645,000 shares of common stock through May 18, 2003.
The options are exercisable at the fair market value on the date of grant for a
period determined by the Board of Directors (not more than ten years from the
date granted). The options contain restrictions as to transferability and
exercisability after termination of employment. The Company has committed not
to issue any more stock options under Stock Option Plan C.

Initially, under Stock Option Plan D, the Company was authorized to grant to
associates, directors, consultants or advisors to the Company options to
purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock through January 1, 2005.
Additional shares which were approved by the Company’s shareholders on May 17,
1994, May 16, 1995 and May 22, 1998, increasing the total



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

authorized to grant to 4,600,000 shares. The options are exercisable at a
price (not less than fair market value on the date of grant) and during a
period determined by the Stock Option Committee. Options under this plan
currently vest over periods of up to ten years and are exercisable for periods
of up to 25 years.

Initially, under Stock Option Plan E, the Company was authorized to grant to
associates (other than officers subject to the provisions of Section 16(a) of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934), consultants, or advisors to the
Company options to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock through
January 1, 2005. Additional shares of 1,100,000 and 1,000,000 were approved by
the Company’s Board of Directors on December 8, 2000 and March 9, 2001,
respectively, increasing the total authorized to grant to 4,100,000 shares. The
options are exercisable at a price (not less than fair market value on the date
of grant) and during a period determined by the Stock Option Committee.
Options under this plan currently vest over periods of up to ten years and are
exercisable for periods of up to 25 years.

Under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan F, the Company is authorized to grant
to associates, directors and consultants 2,000,000 shares of common stock
awards. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted stock
and performance shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock and performance unit awards which may be payable in the
form of common stock or cash. However, not more than 500,000 of such shares
will be available to granting any types of grants other than options or stock
appreciation rights.

The Company has also granted 504,507 other non-qualified stock options under
separate agreements to employees and certain third parties. These options are
exercisable at a price equal to or greater than the fair market value on the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

11 Income Taxes

Income tax expense (benefit) before extraordinary item for the years ended
2002, 2001 and 2000, consists of the following:

Income tax benefit attributable to the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle for goodwill was $486,000 in 2002. Income tax expense
(benefit) allocated to stockholders’ equity for unrealized holding gains
(losses) on available-for-sale equity securities was ($6,824,000) and
$39,846,000 for the years ended 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax
basis of assets and liabilities that give rise to significant portions of
deferred income taxes at the end of 2002 and 2001 relate to the following:

Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future
taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible,
as well as the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, management
believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefit of
these deductible differences. At December 28, 2002, the Company has net
operating loss carryforwards subject to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code for Federal income tax purposes of $37.2 million which are available to
offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2014.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The effective income tax rates for 2002, 2001, and 2000 were 39%, 33%, and 39%,
respectively. These effective rates differ from the federal statutory rate of
35% as follows:

plans. The 2002, 2001, and 2000 benefits of $1,561,000, $2,328,000, and
$3,525,000, respectively, are treated as increases to additional paid-in
capital.

12 Related Party Transactions

The Company loaned $165,000 in 2001, to the Company’s senior management under
the terms of the Executive Stock Purchase Program (“Program”). The purpose of
the Program is to advance the interests of the Company, the Company’s senior
management, and the Company’s shareholders by offering the Company’s senior
management an incentive to purchase shares of the Company’s stock on the open
market. Pursuant to the Program, the Company provided Program loans to
executives to help finance up to 50% of the total purchase price of the stock
purchased. All Program loans have a term of five (5) years, at an interest
rate of 5.5%. Principal and interest is not due until the end of the five-year
loan term, unless the executive terminates employment. Executives may also
elect to pay interest annually. If interest is not paid annually, it will
compound annually. All Program loans are secured by the purchased shares and
any pledged shares. The balance of these loans, including accrued interest, at
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $2,293,000 and $2,543,000,
respectively.
