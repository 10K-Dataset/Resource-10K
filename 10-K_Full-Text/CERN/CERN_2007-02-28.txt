PART I

Item 1. Business

Overview

Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the “Company”) is a Delaware business incorporated in 1980. The
Company’s corporate headquarters are located at 2800 Rockcreek
Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri 64117. Its telephone number is (816) 221-1024. The Company’s Web site address is www.cerner.com.
The Company makes available free of charge, on or through its Web site, its annual report on Form
10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those
reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cerner is a supplier of healthcare information technology (HIT), healthcare devices and related
services. Organizations ranging from single-doctor practices, to hospitals, to corporations, to
local, regional and national government agencies use

Cerner

®

solutions. Cerner’s solutions and
services are designed to help our clients make healthcare safer, more efficient, and of higher
quality.

The Company’s solutions have been designed and developed on the unified

Cerner
Millennium

®

architecture. The person-centric solution framework combines clinical,
financial and management information systems. It provides secure access to an individual’s
electronic medical record at the point of care and organizes and proactively delivers information
to meet the specific needs of the physician, nurse, laboratory technician, pharmacist or other care
provider, front- and back-office professionals and even consumers. In addition, Cerner’s

CareAware

™

device architecture is designed to bridge the gap between
medical devices and patient information by connecting information
from various devices to the
clinician workflow and electronic medical record. Cerner also offers a broad range of services
including implementation and training, remote hosting, support and
maintenance, healthcare data analysis and clinical
process optimization.

The Healthcare and Healthcare IT Industry

Around the world, healthcare costs continue to rise as healthcare professionals work to uphold
quality standards. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has reported that, in the
United States, healthcare represents 16 percent of the gross national product, which they project
will reach 20 percent by 2015. In this climate, HIT is broadly seen as a way to curb these growing
costs while improving the quality of care.

Policy Reforms

The federal government is currently using its position as the nation’s leading purchaser of
healthcare products and services to promote HIT use. For example, CMS and the Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) are allowing acute care organizations to help provide referring physicians
with hardware, software, training and support necessary to implement e-prescribing or interoperable
electronic medical record systems.

To increase the availability of healthcare pricing information, CMS posts information on what
Medicare will pay for 30 common elective procedures and other hospital admissions. We believe this
focus on transparency could incent healthcare organizations to use technology to improve safety and
efficiency.

Private Sector Approaches

Healthcare costs are a significant issue for employers as well. According to the Journal of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine, productivity losses related to personal and family health
problems cost U.S. employers $1,685 per employee per year or about $226 billion annually. The cost
of health insurance rose 7.7 percent in 2006, much higher than the overall rate of inflation (3.5
percent) or the increase in workers’ earnings (3.8 percent).

Faced with these costs, some large employers have become advocates of HIT. For example, Applied
Materials, Inc., BP America, Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Intel
Corporation, Pitney Bowes, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. founded an initiative in 2006 focused on creating personal health records for their employees. We
believe this type of employer activism is a positive for the HIT industry as it supports
wider-spread adoption of electronic medical records.



Cerner Vision

Cerner’s vision has evolved from a fundamental thought: Healthcare should revolve around the
individual, not the encounter. This concept led to Cerner’s vision of a Community Health Model and
the creation of the unified

Cerner Millennium

architecture, the Company’s person-centric,
enterprise-wide architecture. The Community Health Model encompasses four steps:

Automate the Care Process

Cerner offers a longitudinal, person-centric electronic medical record, giving clinicians
electronic access to the right information at the right time and place to achieve the optimal
health outcome.

Connect the Person

Cerner is dedicated to building a personal health system. Medical information and care regimens
accessible from home empower consumers to effectively manage their conditions and adhere to
treatment plans, creating a new medium between physicians and individuals.

Structure the Knowledge

Cerner is dedicated to building systems that help bring the best science to every medical decision
by structuring, storing and studying the content surrounding each care episode to achieve optimal
clinical and financial outcomes.

Close the Loop

Incorporating
a medical discovery into daily practice can take as long as ten years. Cerner is
dedicated to building systems that implement evidence-based medicine, reducing the average time
from the discovery of an improved method to the change in the standard of care.

Solution and Service Highlights

Foremost among the Company’s major accomplishments in 2006 was the release of

Cerner Millennium

. With the

Millennium 2007

solutions, the Company delivered the largest set of new functions it
has ever included in a single release. The

Millennium 2007

solutions included a major change in
design philosophy around role-venue-condition workflow that resulted in a new physician-user
interface and workflow. We also redefined our approach to quality by implementing new
testing and performance standards.

We are
also improving the value of our solutions through

CernerWorks

, our six-year-old, remote-hosting business. Our
system availability is now approaching 99.99 percent, or “four nines”, scheduled availability.

In 2006,
we also introduced the Lights On

™

Network, surveillance system and service. The network
monitors client-hosted and Cerner-hosted systems in near real-time, predicting and helping to
prevent future system issues.

Cerner
made significant changes in our physician practice business,

PowerWorks

®

,

in
2006. We went to market with a single price point for automating a
physician practice's front
office, clinical workflow and back office. We also redesigned our implementation approach,
using a tele-service model and Web-based training, which significantly reduces, and in some cases
eliminates, the need for on-site implementation consultants.

The Company is also enhancing its professional implementation and consulting services. Through our

MethodM

methodology, we give our clients a predictable approach to implementation that translates
into a faster return on their investment. And we expanded the productivity gains we have made with
our centralized implementation and upgrade centers and our

Bedrock

solution (our system of
automated tools that guide clients through the design, build and maintenance of a

Cerner Millennium

system). With these initiatives and continued efficiencies in

CernerWorks

managed services, Cerner
is striving to reduce the effort of implementing and operating the Company’s systems.

An area of focus for 2007 is

Millennium Lighthouse

™

, a consulting practice that works with
clients to determine previously unidentified and unconnected relationships among healthcare
processes and outcomes. Clients use the solutions to compare these relationships to similar
organizations and implement measurable process changes.

Positioning for Continued Long-Term Growth

Cerner believes the market remains healthy for selling and delivering HIT solutions for acute care
and physician organizations in the U.S. In addition, we are continuing to expand our boundaries.
Four specific areas of focus include:

1.

Continued expansion of our global reach

2.

Healthcare data, using our extensive clinical databases to help pharmaceutical companies
solve several issues such as getting drugs approved faster and safety monitoring

3.

Creating connected healthcare devices

4.

Reducing friction in healthcare through more efficient payment for services, community
connectivity, a national record bank and a global record bank

Global Expansion

The Company continues to grow in global markets. Cerner provides software for England’s national
Choose and Book scheduling system, which exceeded two million referrals during 2006. We also won
a new contract to provide an imaging diagnostic solution in the southwest and northwest of England.
Cerner also has contracts to provide HIT for approximately 40 percent of the country’s population,
namely the Southern England and London clusters of the country’s Connecting for Health initiative.

Cerner is expanding its presence in Australia, with contracts to provide HIT in the two largest
states, Victoria and New South Wales. We are also increasing our focus in other world markets,
including France, the Middle East, Malaysia and Canada.



Healthcare Data

Cerner’s Life Sciences business, which provides analysis services to pharmaceutical companies,
continues to grow. In 2006, Cerner acquired Galt Associates, Inc. (now Cerner Galt, Inc.), a
company that helps drug companies better understand the performance of their compounds through
surveillance of adverse drug events. An important component of Cerner Life Sciences is the

Health
Facts

®

solution, a data warehouse that captures and stores the data generated by

Cerner

solutions, aggregates it and develops reports that enable healthcare organizations to identify
areas for intervention and improvement, and benchmark progress against regional and national data.

Connected Healthcare Devices

In 2006, Cerner extended

Cerner Millennium

with our

CareAware

healthcare device
architecture and

MDBus

™

technology, a “USB for healthcare.” This innovation extends the reach of

Cerner Millennium

solutions, opening new opportunities for
growth. The

CareAware

architecture allows
for connection of healthcare devices to

Cerner Millennium

and non-

Millennium

systems. The Company
also continued development of our new

RxStation

™

automated medication dispensing devices.

Reducing Friction

Healthe

™

, our family of solutions and services for employers and governments, is another area of
focus for the Company.

As an employer, Cerner has begun using the Health

e

Exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, as the third party administrator of our health plans. Cerner intends to begin offering the
Health

e

Exchange third party administrator services to other employers. Also included in

Healthe

services is our on-site Health

e

Clinic.

Software Development

We commit significant resources to developing new health information system solutions. As of
December 30, 2006, approximately 2,300 associates were engaged full-time in software solution
development activities. Total expenditures for the development and enhancement of our software
solutions were approximately $262,163,000, $225,606,000 and $188,264,000 during the 2006, 2005 and
2004 fiscal years, respectively. These figures include both capitalized and non-capitalized
portions and exclude amounts amortized for financial reporting purposes.

The Company expects to continue investment and development efforts for its current and future
solution offerings. As new clinical and management information needs emerge, Cerner intends to
enhance its current software solution lines with new versions released to clients on a periodic
basis. In addition, Cerner plans to: expand its current software solution lines by developing
additional information systems for clinical, financial, operational and/or consumer use; continue
to support simultaneous use of

Cerner

solutions across multiple facilities; and, continue to
expand in the global marketplace.

The Company is committed to maintaining open attributes in its system architecture to achieve
operability in a diverse set of technical and application environments. The Company strives to
design its systems to co-exist with disparate applications developed and supported by other
suppliers. This effort is exemplified by Cerner’s

Open Engine Application Gateway™

,

Open Port
Interface™

and

MillenniumObjects

®

offerings.

Sales and Marketing

The markets for Cerner’s HIT solutions, healthcare devices and services include integrated delivery
networks, physician groups and networks, managed care organizations, hospitals, medical centers,
free-standing reference laboratories, home health agencies, blood banks, imaging centers,
pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, employer coalitions and public health organizations. To
date, a substantial portion of system sales have been in clinical solutions in hospital-based
provider organizations. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is highly scalable, with solutions
being used in organizations ranging from several-doctor physician
practices, to community hospitals,
to complex integrated delivery networks, to local, regional and
national government agencies. All

Cerner Millennium

solutions are
designed to operate on HP or IBM platforms, thereby allowing Cerner to be price competitive across
the full size and organizational structure range of healthcare
providers. The sale of a Cerner software health
information system usually takes approximately nine to 18 months, from the time of initial contact
to the signing of a contract.



The Company’s executive marketing management is located in its North Kansas City, Missouri,
headquarters, while its client representatives are deployed across the United States and globally.
In addition to the U.S., the Company, through subsidiaries and joint
ventures, has sales associates
and/or offices in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
Malaysia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. Cerner’s consolidated revenues
include foreign sales of $207,367,000, $113,317,000 and $62,426,000 for the 2006, 2005 and 2004
fiscal years, respectively.

The Company supports its sales force with technical personnel who perform demonstrations of

Cerner

solutions and services and assist clients in determining the proper hardware and software
configurations. The Company’s primary direct marketing strategy is to generate sales contacts from
its existing client base and through presentations at industry seminars and tradeshows. Cerner
utilizes telemarketing primarily for sales to physician practices.
Cerner markets the

PowerWorks

solution, offered on a subscription basis, directly to the physician practice market.
Cerner attends a number of major tradeshows each year and sponsors executive user conferences,
which feature industry experts who address the HIT needs of large healthcare organizations.

Client Services

Substantially all of Cerner’s clients enter into software maintenance agreements with the Company
for support of their

Cerner

systems. In addition to immediate software support in the event of
problems, these agreements allow clients the use of new releases of the

Cerner

solutions covered by
maintenance agreements. Each client has 24-hour access to the client support team located at
Cerner’s world headquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri and the Company’s global support
organization in the United Kingdom. Most of Cerner’s clients also enter into hardware maintenance
agreements with Cerner. These arrangements normally provide for a fixed monthly fee for specified
services. In the majority of cases, Cerner subcontracts hardware maintenance to the hardware
manufacturer. Cerner also offers a set of managed services that include remote hosting,
application management services and disaster recovery.

Backlog

At December 30, 2006, Cerner had a contract backlog of approximately $2,194,460,000 as compared to
approximately $1,724,583,000 at December 31, 2005. Such backlog represents system sales and
services from signed contracts, which have not yet been recognized as revenue. At December 30, 2006, the Company had approximately $132,748,000 of contracts
receivable, which represents revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method but not
yet billable under the terms of the contract. At December 30, 2006, Cerner had a software support
and maintenance backlog of approximately $469,473,000 as compared to approximately $415,681,000 at
December 31, 2005. Such backlog represents contracted software support and hardware maintenance
services for a period of 12 months. The Company estimates that approximately 42 percent of the
aggregate backlog at December 30, 2006 of $2,663,933,000 will be recognized as revenue during 2007.

Competition

The market for HIT solutions, devices and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and
subject to rapid technological change. Our principal existing competitors in the healthcare
solutions and services market include: Eclipsys Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare
Technologies, iSoft Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc.
(“Meditech”), Misys Healthcare Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation,
each of which offers a suite of software solutions that compete with many of our software solutions
and services. Other competitors focus on only a portion of the market that Cerner addresses. For
example, competitors such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Emdeon Corporation and Quality
Systems, Inc. offer solutions to the physician practice market but do not currently have a
significant presence in the health systems and independent hospital market. We view our principal
competitors in the healthcare device market to include: Omnicell, Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc. and
McKesson Corporation; and we view our principal competitors in the healthcare transactions market
to include: ProxyMed, Inc., Emdeon Corporation, McKesson Corporation and The TriZetto Group, Inc.,
with almost all of these competitors being substantially larger or having more experience and
market share than us in their respective market. In addition, we expect that major software
information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers, system
integrators, managed care companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer
competitive software solutions, devices or services. The pace of change in the HIT market is rapid
and there are frequent new software solution, device or service introductions, enhancements and
evolving industry standards and requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in
this market



include the breadth and quality of solution and service offerings, the stability of the solution
provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems and devices, the ongoing support
for the systems and devices and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software
solutions and devices.

Number of Employees (“Associates”)

As of December 30, 2006, the Company employed 7,419 associates worldwide.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risks Related to Cerner Corporation

We may be subject to product-related liabilities.

Many of our software solutions, healthcare
devices or services (including life sciences/research services) provide data for use by healthcare
providers in providing care to patients. No claims have been brought against us to date regarding
injuries related to the use of our software solutions, healthcare devices or services (including
life sciences/research services), but such claims may be made in the future. Although we maintain
liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business, there can
be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future,
prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms,
if at all. A successful material claim brought against us, if uninsured or under-insured, could
materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties.

Our software solutions and
healthcare devices, particularly the

Cerner Millennium

versions, are very complex. As with complex
software solutions and devices offered by others, our software solutions and healthcare devices may
contain coding or other errors, especially when first introduced. Although we conduct extensive
testing, we have discovered errors in our software solutions and healthcare devices after their
introduction. Our software solutions and healthcare devices are intended for use in collecting and
displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users
of our software solutions and healthcare devices have a greater sensitivity to errors than the
market for software products and devices generally. Our client agreements typically provide
warranties concerning material errors and other matters. Failure of a client’s

Cerner

software
solutions and/or healthcare devices to meet these warranties could constitute a material breach
under the client agreement, allowing the client to terminate the agreement and possibly obtain a
refund and/or damages, or might require us to incur additional expense in order to make the
software solution or healthcare device meet these criteria. Our client agreements generally limit
our liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain
jurisdictions or circumstances. A successful material claim brought against us, if uninsured or
under-insured, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may experience interruption at our data centers or client support facilities.

We perform data
center and/or hosting services for certain clients, including the storage of critical patient and
administrative data. In addition, we provide support services to our clients through various
client support facilities. We have redundancies, such as multiple backup generators and redundant
telecommunications lines, as well as technical and physical security safeguards, built into our
operations to reduce the likelihood of disruptions. However, complete failure of all generators,
impairment of all telecommunications lines, severe damage (environmental, accidental, intentional
or pandemic) to the buildings, the equipment inside the buildings housing our data centers, the
client data contained therein and/or the personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a
disruption in operations and negatively impact clients who depend on us for data center and system
support services. Any interruption in operations at our data centers and/or client support
facilities could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients, hurt our ability to
obtain new clients, result in revenue loss, cause potential liability to our clients and us and
increase insurance and other operating costs.

Our proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims or may be infringed upon.

We
rely upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure
agreements, confidentiality agreements with third parties and technical measures to maintain the
confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information. We also rely on trademark and
copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We have initiated a patent program but
currently have a



limited patent portfolio. Despite our protective measures, we may not be able to adequately
protect against copying, reverse-engineering, infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual
property.

In addition, we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of
competitors and patents in the healthcare information technology market increases, the
functionality of our software solutions and services expands, and we
enter new markets such
as healthcare device innovation, healthcare transactions and life sciences. These claims, even if
not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If we become liable to third parties for infringing
their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop
noninfringing technology, obtain a license and/or cease selling the solutions, devices and services
that contain or rely upon the infringing intellectual property.

We are subject to risks associated with our global operations.

We market, sell and service our
solutions, devices and services globally. We have established offices around the world, including
in: the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. We will continue to expand
our global operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales
and support channels. Our business is generally transacted in the local functional currency. In
some countries, our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local
partners. There is a risk that we may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, we
may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for our solutions, devices and
services.

Global operations are subject to inherent risks, and our future results could be adversely affected
by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include, but are not limited to:

Our failure to effectively hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could
unfavorably affect our performance.

We have recently begun to utilize derivative instruments to
hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Some of these instruments
and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in
the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about risk on financial
instruments, see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operation — Market Risk.” Further, our financial results from global operations may decrease if
we fail to execute or improperly hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations.

Our success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel.

To remain competitive in
our industries, we must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing,
consulting and technical personnel, including executives, consultants, programmers and systems
architects skilled in the healthcare information technology, healthcare devices, healthcare
transactions and life sciences industries and the technical environments in which our solutions,
devices and services operate. Competition for such personnel in our industries is intense. Our
failure to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
prospects for long-term growth. Our



success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management,
sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel. We have succession plans in place; however,
the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact to our business and
results of operations, and could potentially inhibit development and delivery of our solutions,
devices and services and market share advances.

We significantly rely on third party suppliers.

We license or purchase intellectual property and
technology (such as software, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors,
and incorporate it into or sell it in conjunction with our solutions, devices and services, some of
which are critical to the operation and delivery of our solutions, devices and services. If any of
the third party suppliers were to change product offerings, increase prices or terminate our
licenses or supply contracts, we might need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional
internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our solutions, devices
and services. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms, or may not be as widely
accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by our existing
suppliers. If the cost of licensing, purchasing or maintaining the third party intellectual
property or technology significantly increases, our gross margin levels could significantly
decrease. In addition, interruption in functionality of our solutions, devices and services could
adversely affect future sales of solutions, devices and services.

We intend to continue strategic business acquisitions which are subject to inherent risks.

In
order to expand our solutions, device offerings and services and grow our market and client base,
we may continue to seek and complete strategic business acquisitions that we believe are
complementary to our business. Acquisitions have inherent risks which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including, but not
limited to: 1) failure to successfully integrate the business and financial operations, services,
intellectual property, solutions or personnel of the acquired business; 2) diversion of
management’s attention from other business concerns; 3) entry into markets in which we have little
or no direct prior experience; 4) failure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets;
5) loss of clients or key personnel of the acquired business; 6) incurrence of debt and/or
assumption of known and unknown liabilities; 7) write-off of software development costs and
amortization of expenses related to intangible assets; and, 8) dilutive issuances of equity
securities. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our
business strategies with respect to these acquisitions, we may not be able to achieve projected
results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses.

Risks Related to the Healthcare Information Technology, Healthcare Device and Healthcare
Transaction Industry

The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and
regulatory influences.

For example, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-32) contained
significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid and had an impact for several years on healthcare
providers’ ability to invest in capital intensive systems. In addition, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is having a direct impact on the healthcare
industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets and necessary security
and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of protected health information. These
regulatory factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations.
Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S.
healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and
reimbursement systems. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement
in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare
industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their
investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our software solutions and
services.

Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with
greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price
reductions for our software solutions and services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, our
client base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance
of acquiring each client becomes greater.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local, state and federal level.

We are subject
to a significant and wide-ranging number of regulations both within the United States and
elsewhere, such as



regulations in the areas of: healthcare fraud, e-prescribing, claims processing
and transmission, medical devices and the security and privacy of patient data.

Healthcare Fraud.

Federal and state governments continue to strengthen their positions and scrutiny
over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are
reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Healthcare providers who
are our clients are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things,
prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or
arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these
federal or state healthcare programs. Federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding,
powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. The effect of this government
regulation on our clients is difficult to predict. While we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with any applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may
be applicable to us, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may
be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that
could broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations
or the way in which they deal with us. If such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable
to us and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to
sanctions or liability, including exclusion from government health programs, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

E-Prescribing.

The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing, electronic
routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law. States
have differing prescription format requirements, which we have programmed into our software. In
addition, in November 2005, the Department of Health and Human
Services announced regulations by CMS related to “E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program” (“E-Prescribing
Regulations”). These E-Prescribing Regulations were mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The E-Prescribing Regulations set forth standards for
the transmission of electronic prescriptions. The final regulations adopted two standards
effective January 2006. A second and final set of required standards are to be published no later
than April 1, 2008 and implemented no later than April 1, 2009. These standards are detailed and
significant, and cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions
but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage
information. Our efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these
regulations could be time-consuming and expensive.

Claims Transmissions.

Certain of our solutions assist our clients in submitting claims to payers,
which claims are governed by federal and state laws. Our solutions are capable of electronically
transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients’ payers for
approval and reimbursement. Federal law provides civil liability to any person that knowingly
submits a claim to a payer, including, for example, Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans,
seeking payment for any services or items that have not been provided to the patient. Federal law
may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. We have
policies and procedures in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete transmission
of claims, provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete.
The HIPAA security, privacy and transaction standards, as discussed below, also have a potentially
significant effect on our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and
provided in a way that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations.

Regulation of Medical Devices.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has
declared that certain of our solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“Act”) and amendments to the Act. As a consequence, we are
subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to those solutions that are actively
regulated. Other countries have similar regulations in place related to medical devices, that now
or may in the future apply to certain of our solutions. If other of our solutions are deemed to be
actively regulated medical devices by the FDA or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we
do business, we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing
requirements including pre-market notification clearance. Complying with these medical device
regulations on a global perspective is time consuming
and expensive. Further, it is possible that these regulatory agencies may become more active in
regulating software that is used in healthcare.



There have been eight FDA inspections since 1998 at various Cerner sites. Inspections conducted at
our world headquarters in 1999 and our prior Houston facility in 2002 each resulted in the issuance
of an FDA Form 483 that we responded to promptly. The FDA has taken no further action with respect
to either of the Form 483s that were issued in 1999 and 2002. The remaining six FDA inspections,
including inspections at our world headquarters in 2006, resulted in no issuance of a Form 483. We
remain subject to periodic FDA inspections and we could be required to undertake additional actions
to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply
with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our solutions. The FDA has many
enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and/or criminal
prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Security and Privacy of Patient Information.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality
of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released. These
regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information
and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures. Regulations
currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often
unclear and difficult to apply.

HIPAA requires national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and
the data elements used in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually
identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include healthcare
organizations such as our clients, were required to comply with the privacy standards by April
2003, the transaction regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As a
business associate of the covered entities, we, in most instances, must also ensure compliance with
the HIPAA regulations as it pertains to our clients.

The effect of HIPAA on our business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurances that we
will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation, or that we will
be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities. Furthermore, we are unable to
predict what changes to HIPAA, or the regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA, might be made in the
future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance with HIPAA.
Evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our clients to obtain, use
or disseminate patient information. This could adversely affect demand for our solutions if they
are not re-designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations
that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our clients to execute new
or modified healthcare transactions. We may need to expend additional capital, research and
development and other resources to modify our solutions and devices to address these evolving data
security and privacy issues.

We operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries, and our ability to successfully compete
and continue to grow our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to market changes and
changing technologies and to bring competitive new solutions, devices, features and services to
market in a timely fashion.

The market for healthcare information systems, healthcare devices,
healthcare transactions and life sciences consulting services are intensely competitive,
dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological and innovative changes. Development of new
proprietary technology or services is complex, entails significant time and expense and may not be
successful. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to introduce new solutions, devices or
services on schedule, or at all, nor can we guarantee that, despite extensive testing, errors will
not be found in our new solution releases, devices or services before or after commercial release,
which could result in solution, device or service delivery redevelopment costs and loss of, or
delay in, market acceptance.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the healthcare information market include the
ease of implementation, the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings, the
stability of the information system provider, the ongoing support for the system and the potential
for enhancements and future compatible software solutions. Certain of our competitors have greater
financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than us and some of our
competitors offer software solutions that we do not offer. Our principal existing competitors in
the healthcare solutions and services
market include: Eclipsys Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare Technologies, iSoft
Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. (“Meditech”), Misys
Healthcare Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, each of which offers
a suite of



software solutions that compete with many of our software solutions and services. There
are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions and
services, including, without limitation: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Emdeon Corporation
and Quality Systems, Inc.
We view our principal competitors in the healthcare device market to include: Omnicell, Inc.,
Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation; and we view our principal competitors in the
healthcare transactions market to include: ProxyMed, Inc., Emdeon Corporation, McKesson Corporation
and The TriZetto Group, Inc., with almost all of these competitors being substantially larger or
having more experience and market share than us in their respective market.

In addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, large information
technology consulting service providers and system integrators, Internet-based start-up companies
and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions,
devices or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and
there are frequent new software solution introductions, software solution enhancements, device
introductions, device enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result,
our success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce,
on a timely and cost-effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions, devices and services
that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance.

Risks Related to the Company’s Stock

Our quarterly operating results may vary which could adversely affect our stock price.

Our
quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods,
including, variations from guidance, expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly
operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes, any
material weaknesses identified in our internal controls, demand for our solutions, devices and
services, the financial condition of our clients and potential clients, our long sales cycle,
potentially long installation and implementation cycles for larger, more complex and higher-priced
systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of
healthcare industry trends and the market for our

Cerner Millennium

solutions, a large percentage
of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and
higher-priced systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant
technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. Sales may be
subject to delays due to changes in clients’ internal budgets, procedures for approving large
capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, availability of personnel
resources and by actions taken by competitors. Delays in the expected sale, installation or
implementation of these large systems may have a significant impact on our anticipated quarterly
revenues and consequently our earnings, since a significant percentage of our expenses are
relatively fixed.

We recognize software revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount
of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon our and our
clients’ abilities to meet project
milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract could
result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material
adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter.

Our revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and
greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of clients’ year-end efforts to
make all final capital expenditures for the then-current year.

Our sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter.

We use a “pipeline”
system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales
associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities, such as the date when they estimate that
a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale. These
estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. We compare this pipeline at
various points in time to evaluate trends in our business. This analysis provides guidance in
business planning and forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative.
Our pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable
predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, partially because
of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very
difficult to estimate. A negative variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the
pipeline into contracts, or in the pipeline itself, could cause our plan or forecast to be
inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business



results. For example, a slowdown in information
technology spending, adverse economic conditions or a variety of other factors can cause purchasing
decisions to be delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled, which would reduce the overall pipeline
conversion rate in a particular period of time. Because a substantial portion of our contracts are
completed in the latter part of a quarter, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly
enough in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in our pipeline conversion rate
in any given fiscal

quarter(s).

The trading price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market for our common stock may
experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including
actual or anticipated variations in operating results, rumors about our performance or
solutions, devices and services, changes in expectations of future financial performance or
estimates of securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures,
client relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a matter of policy, we do not generally comment
on our stock price or rumors.

Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the markets for software, healthcare and information
technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been
unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual
operating performance.

Our Directors have authority to issue preferred stock and our corporate governance documents
contain anti-takeover provisions.

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of
those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be
issued in the future.

In addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more
difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This
includes, but is not limited to, provisions that: provide for a classified board of directors,
prohibit shareholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of
shareholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that
prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested shareholder for a period
of three years from the date the person became an interested shareholder, unless certain conditions
are met, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.

Item 2. Properties

World Headquarters

Our world headquarters offices are located in a Company-owned office park in North Kansas City,
Missouri, containing approximately 1,006,467 gross square feet of useable space (the “Campus”),
inclusive of the new data center and clinic buildings described below. As of December 30, 2006, we
were



using approximately 867,619 square feet of such useable space for our U.S. corporate
headquarter operations and 3,687 square feet of the remaining space was leased to Executive Travel,
a third party company.

In February 2006, we completed construction on the Campus of a 13,136 square foot addition to the
2901 Rockcreek Parkway building to house Health

e

Clinic, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, which provides
primary care services for our associates and their family members.

In 2006,
the Company began construction of the world headquarters Technology Center, a 135,161
square foot data center facility on the Campus. Construction is expected to be complete June 2007.

In 2004, we purchased approximately 12 acres of unimproved real estate adjacent to the Campus for
campus expansion. This land was purchased to provide a secondary entry into the Campus and to
provide for future building development as needed. The first phase of development was the roadway
extension and second entry point into the Campus. The second phase of development is the data center
facility described above. Future development of this land is undetermined at this time.

Other Properties

In February 2007, we entered into a long-term lease for 480,700 gross square feet of property
located in Kansas City, Missouri. The office space, known as the Innovation Campus, will house
associates from our intellectual property organizations.

In June 2005, we purchased 263,512 gross square feet of property located in Kansas City, Missouri.
The office space, known as the Cerner Oaks Campus, houses associates from the

CernerWorks

and
TechnologyWorks groups and associates of Cerner’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health

e

Exchange.

We also own property located along the north riverbank of the Missouri River, approximately two
miles from the Campus. This property consists of a 96,318 gross square foot building and a
1,300-car parking garage. The building has been renovated for use as a corporate training, meeting
and event center for the Company and third parties. We have also made use of the parking garage to
meet overflow-parking demands on the Campus.

In 2006, we acquired leases on two additional offices in Sterling, Virginia and Blue Bell,
Pennsylvania, as part of the Galt Associates, Inc. acquisition.

As of the end of February 2007, the Company leased office space in: Birmingham, Alabama; Beverly
Hills and Garden Grove, California; Denver, Colorado; Overland Park, Kansas; Waltham,
Massachusetts; Bel Air, Maryland; Minneapolis and Rochester, Minnesota; Kansas City,
Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Beaverton, Oregon; Blue Bell, Pennsylvania; and Sterling and

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the “Company”) is headquartered in North Kansas City, Missouri.
The Company primarily derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions,
hardware, healthcare devices and services that give healthcare providers secure access to clinical,
administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the quality, safety and
efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. We implement the healthcare solutions as stand-alone,
combined or enterprise-wide systems.

Cerner Millennium

software solutions can be managed by the
Company’s clients or in the Company’s data center via a managed services model.

Results Overview

The Company delivered strong results in 2006. Total revenues for 2006 were $1,378,038,000, an
increase of 19% over 2005 revenues of $1,160,785,000. Net Earnings for 2006 were $109,891,000, an
increase of 27% over 2005 net earnings of $86,251,000. Total new business bookings, which reflect
the value of executed contracts for software, hardware, content subscriptions, services and managed
services (hosting of clients’ software in the Company’s data center), was a Company record at
$1,469,300,000 in 2006, an increase of 8% compared to $1,355,000,000 in 2005.

In 2006, the Company generated $232,718,000 of cash flow from operations, with record cash
collections of approximately $1,457,600,000 and days sales outstanding (DSO) decreasing from 89
days at the end of 2005 to 87 days at the end of 2006.

Healthcare Information Technology Market

2006 continued a trend of positive developments in the healthcare information technology (HIT)
marketplace and for the Company. Around the world, healthcare costs continue to rise as healthcare professionals work to uphold
quality standards. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has reported that, in the
United States, healthcare represents 16 percent of the gross national product, which they project
will reach 20 percent by 2015. In this climate, HIT is broadly seen as a way to curb these growing
costs while improving the quality of care.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 30, 2006, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

The Company’s net earnings increased 27% to $109,891,000 in 2006 compared to $86,251,000 in 2005.
Net earnings for 2006 include adjustments for approximately
$1,994,000 of tax benefit for items relating to prior periods. 2006 net earnings also
reflect the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” which requires the expensing of stock options. Adoption of SFAS 123R
reduced 2006 net earnings by $11,746,000 (net of taxes). Net earnings for 2005 included an
adjustment in the third quarter of 2005 related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry
back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated (Zynx) of $4,794,000 and
the write-off of acquired in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2005 of
$3,941,000, net of a $2,441,000 tax benefit. Adjusting for these items, 2006 net earnings
increased 40% to $119,643,000 compared to 2005 net earnings of $85,398,000.

- The Company’s revenues increased 19% to $1,378,038,000 in 2006 from $1,160,785,000 in
2005. The revenue composition for 2006 was $505,743,000 in system sales, $340,416,000 in support
and maintenance, $492,828,000 in services and $39,051,000 in reimbursed travel.

System sales increased 12% to $505,743,000 in 2006 from $449,734,000 in 2005. Included in system
sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software, installation fees,
transaction processing and subscriptions. System sales growth in 2006 was driven by strong growth
of software, hardware and subscriptions.



Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 23% to $833,244,000 in 2006 from $677,664,000
in 2005. Support and maintenance revenues were $340,416,000 and $296,716,000 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Services revenues were $492,828,000 and $380,948,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and
hardware, professional services, excluding installation and remote hosting services. These
increases were driven by strong performance in delivering

Cerner Millennium

solutions to clients
and the continued success of the

CernerWorks

remote hosting services.

Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as
revenue, increased 27% in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase is due to a strong increase in new
business bookings in 2006 compared to 2005. At December 30, 2006, the Company had $2,194,460,000
in contract backlog and $469,473,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $1,724,583,000
in contract backlog and $415,681,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2005.

Cost of Revenues

- The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party
consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased
from hardware and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of
hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost
of revenues was 21% of total revenues in 2006 and 22% of total revenues in 2005. Such costs, as a
percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and
support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in
the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from strong levels of
software sales and strong growth in services that do not have a high level of associated third
party costs.

Sales and Client Service

- Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service
personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and
marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a
percent of total revenues were 42% and 40% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in total
sales and client service expenses to $578,050,000 in 2006 from $466,206,000 in 2005 was primarily
due to an increase in personnel expenses associated with the strong growth in our professional
services and managed services businesses and an increased presence in the global market. In
addition, 2006 sales and client service expense includes $11,412,000 of expense related to the
adoption of SFAS 123R.

Software Development

- Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other
direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs.
Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized
portions, for 2006 and 2005 were $262,163,000 and $225,606,000, respectively. Capitalized software
costs were $60,943,000 and $62,039,000 for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization of
capitalized software costs was $45,750,000 and $47,888,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, leading
to total recognized software development expense of $246,970,000 and $211,455,000 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The increase in aggregate expenditures in software development in 2006 was due to
continued development of

Cerner Millennium

solutions. In addition, 2006 software development
expense includes $4,269,000 of expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R.

General and Administrative

- General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate,
financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses, professional fees and the
transaction gains or losses on foreign currency. These expenses as a percent of total revenues
were 7% in both 2006 and 2005. Total general and administrative expenses were $95,881,000 and
$81,620,000 for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company had net transaction gains on foreign
currency of $3,764,000 for 2006 compared to $2,700,000 for 2005. 2006 general and administrative
expense includes $3,340,000 of expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R.

Interest Expense, Net

–

Net interest expense was $697,000 in 2006 compared to $5,858,000 in
2005. Interest income increased to $11,877,000 in 2006 from $3,871,000 in 2005, due primarily to
higher interest rates and a higher cash balance. Interest expense increased to $12,574,000 in 2006
from $9,729,000 in 2005, due primarily to a higher level of debt during 2006.

Other Income, Net

- Other income was $2,074,000 in 2006 compared to $666,000 in 2005. Included in
other income is income from office space leased to third parties. 2006 other income also includes
a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2006 related to the renegotiation of a supplier contract
that eliminated a



liability related to unfavorable future commitments due to that supplier. The
Company was able to renegotiate the contract to eliminate certain minimum volume requirements and
reduce pricing to market rates leading to the elimination of the previously recorded liability. The
increase in other income in 2006 was driven by this gain and by higher lease income.

Income Taxes

- The Company’s effective tax rate was 34% and 36% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Tax expense for 2006 includes benefits of approximately $1,994,000
for adjustments relating to prior periods. Tax expense for 2005 includes an adjustment that reduced
tax expense related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss
generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,749,000. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rates
were 36% and 40% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Operations by Segment

The
Company has two operating segments, Domestic and Global. Beginning in
2006 we began allocating certain expenses related to our managed
services that were previously classified as Other to the geographic segment to
which they relate. As a
result, the prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the change in reportable
segments.

Operating earnings in the Domestic segment increased $89,393,000 for the year ended December
30, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Domestic segment revenues increased
$122,858,000 in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period driven by strong bookings growth.
Costs of revenues were basically unchanged at 22% and 23% of total Domestic segment revenues for
the year ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. Domestic segment operating
expenses in 2006 increased $19,987,000 compared to 2005, primarily driven by spending to support
growth in professional services and managed services.

Operating earnings in the Global segment increased $12,542,000 for the year ended December 30, 2006
compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Total revenues increased $94,050,000 in the 2006
period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 revenues included approximately $69 million from the
Company’s major contracts in London and Southern England. The revenues from these contracts did not
change operating earnings as the Company is accounting for them using a zero-margin approach of
applying percentage-of-completion accounting until the software customization and development
services are completed. Once software customization and development services are completed, which
is expected
in 2008, the remaining unrecognized portion of the fee will be recognized ratably over the
remaining term of the arrangement, which expires in 2014. Costs of revenues were 19% and 15% of
total Global segment revenues for the year ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
costs of revenues as a



percent of total revenues was driven by a much higher level of global
hardware sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating expenses in the 2006 period increased
$59,473,000 compared to the 2005 period primarily due to hiring personnel for the projects in
England and supporting growth in other global regions.

Operating
losses in Other increased $76,204,000 for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Other are revenues and expenses not tracked by
geographic segment. Operating expenses increased $75,778,000 in 2006 compared to 2005. This
increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in expenses such as software development,
marketing, general and administrative, share-based compensation expense and depreciation.
Operating expenses in the 2005 period includes the write-off of acquired in-process research and
development of $6,382,000.

Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared to Year Ended January 1, 2005

The Company’s net earnings increased 33% to $86,251,000 in 2005 compared to $64,648,000 in 2004.
Net earnings for 2005 included an adjustment in the third quarter of 2005 related to a prior period
for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,749,000
and the write-off of acquired in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2005 of
$3,941,000, net of a $2,441,000 tax benefit. Included in 2004 net earnings are an adjustment in
the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay accrual that reduced net earnings
by $2,076,000, net of $1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale of Zynx, in the first quarter of
2004 that increased net earnings by $3,023,000. Excluding these four items, 2005 net earnings
would have increased 34% to $85,443,000 compared to 2004 net earnings of $63,701,000.

Revenues

- The Company’s revenues increased 25% to $1,160,785,000 in 2005 from $926,356,000 in
2004. Revenues for 2005 included revenues from the acquired medical business division of
VitalWorks, Inc. (VitalWorks), which closed on January 3, 2005 . Excluding the revenue
from the medical business division of VitalWorks, 2005 revenues increased 18% over 2004. The
revenue composition for 2005 was $449,734,000 in system sales, $296,716,000 in support and
maintenance, $380,948,000 in services and $33,387,000 in reimbursed travel.

System sales increased 28% to $449,734,000 in 2005 from $351,861,000 in 2004. Included in system
sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software, installation fees,
transaction processing and subscriptions, with each component growing at least 12% in 2005. This
increase is due primarily to an increase in new business bookings and the inclusion of revenue from
the medical business division of VitalWorks in 2005. Excluding revenue from the medical business
division of VitalWorks, system sales would have increased 17%.

Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 25% to $677,664,000 in 2005 from $542,414,000
in 2004. Support and maintenance revenues were $296,716,000 and $241,439,000 in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Services revenues were $380,948,000 and $300,975,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and
hardware, professional services excluding installation, and managed services. These increases were
driven by strong performance in delivering

Cerner Millennium

solutions to clients and the inclusion
of revenue from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks. Excluding revenue from the
medical business division of VitalWorks, support, maintenance and service sales would have
increased 19%.

Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as
revenue, increased 45% in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is due to an increase in new
business bookings in 2005 compared to 2004. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $1,724,583,000
in contract backlog and $415,681,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $1,191,170,000
in contract backlog and $347,662,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2004.

Cost of Revenues

- The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party
consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased
from hardware and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of
hardware
maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of
revenues was 22% of total revenues in 2005 and 21% of total revenues in 2004. Such costs, as a
percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and
support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The increase in
the



cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from higher levels of
hardware sales at lower than historical levels of margin for hardware.

Sales and Client Service

- Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service
personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and
marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a
percent of total revenues were 40% and 41% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in total
sales and client service expenses to $466,206,000 in 2005 from
$383,628,000 in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in personnel, personnel related expenses and increased presence in the global
market. The decrease in this spending as a percent of total revenue reflects the Company’s ability
to get better utilization of its resources and leverage this spending over a larger revenue stream.

Software Development

- Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other
direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs.
Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized
portions, for 2005 and 2004 were $225,606,000 and $188,264,000, respectively. These amounts
exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $62,039,000 and $58,912,000 for 2005 and
2004, respectively. The increase in aggregate expenditures in
software development in 2005 was due
to continued development of

Cerner Millennium

solutions.

General and Administrative

- General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate,
financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses, professional fees and the
transaction gains or losses on foreign currency. These expenses as a percent of total revenues
were 7% in both 2005 and 2004. Total general and administrative expenses were $81,620,000 and
$63,327,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and administrative expenses for 2004 include
an adjustment to increase the vacation pay accrual of $3,346,000, related to prior periods.
Excluding the adjustment to increase the vacation pay accrual, general and administrative expenses
as a percent of revenues were 6% in 2004. The Company had net transaction gains on foreign
currency of $2,700,000 for 2005 compared to net transaction losses on foreign currency of $479,000
for 2004.

The write-off of in-process research and development in 2005 is an expense resulting from the
acquired medical business division of VitalWorks.

Interest Expense, Net

-

Interest income was $3,871,000 in 2005 compared to $3,022,000 in 2004.
This increase is due primarily to higher interest rates, and a higher cash balance fed by cash
collections. Interest expense was $9,729,000 in 2005 compared to $9,174,000 in 2004.

Other Income, Net

- Other income was $666,000 in 2005 compared to $2,608,000 in 2004. Other income
in 2004 included a gain on the sale of Zynx. Also included in other income are revenues from
office space leased to third parties.

Income Taxes

- The Company’s effective tax rate was 36% and 40% in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Tax expense for 2005 includes an adjustment that reduced tax expense related to a prior period for
a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,749,000.
Excluding this adjustment, the Company’s effective tax rate was 40% for 2005.

Operating earnings in the Domestic segment increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the year ended January 1, 2005. Total Domestic segment revenues increased 21% in the
2005 period compared to the 2004 period driven by strong bookings growth. Cost of revenues were
basically unchanged at 23% and 22% of total Domestic segment revenues for the year ended 2005 and
2004, respectively. Domestic segment revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for 2005
included revenues from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks, which closed on
January 3, 2005. Domestic segment operating expenses in 2005 increased 43%
compared to the 2004 period as a result of hiring additional personnel and the inclusion of
expenses from the medical business division of VitalWorks.

Operating earnings in the Global segment increased 130% for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the year ended January 1, 2005. Total revenues increased 82% in the 2005 period
compared to the 2004 period. The Company’s replacement of a competitor in the Southern region of
England was a large contributor to the global success in 2005, with this contract contributing more
than $14 million of revenue. The revenues from this contract did
not change operating earnings as the Company is accounting for it
using a zero-margin approach of applying percentage-of-completion
accounting until the Software Customization and development services
are completed. Once software customization and development services
are completed, which is expected in 2008, the remaining unrecognized
portion of the fee will be recognized ratably over the remaining term
of the arrangement, which expires in 2014. Other regions in our global business also had an outstanding year.
On strength in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, France and Canada, Global segment revenue grew more
than 50% excluding revenue from the Company’s United Kingdom contract. Cost of revenues were 15%
and 12% of total Global segment revenues for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Operating expenses in the 2005 period increased 42% compared to the 2004 period due to hiring
personnel for the higher level of activity outside the United States.

Operating
losses in Other increased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year
ended January 1, 2005. Included in Other are revenues and expenses not tracked by geographic
segment. Operating expenses increased 12% in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. This
increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in expenses such as software development,
marketing, general and administrative and depreciation in the 2005 period compared to the 2004
period. Operating expenses in the 2005 period included the write-off of acquired in-process
research and development of $6,382,000.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the
Company’s revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in
software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is its cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government
Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements.
At December 30, 2006 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $162,545,000, short-term
investments of $146,239,000 and working capital of $444,656,000 compared to cash and cash
equivalents of $113,057,000, short-term investments of $161,230,000 and working capital of $391,541,000 at December 31, 2005.

The Company generated cash of $232,718,000, $228,865,000 and $168,304,000 from operations in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2006 due primarily to a
stronger performance in net earnings and increased collections of receivables. The Company has
periodically provided long-term financing options to creditworthy clients through third party
financing institutions and has directly provided extended payment terms to clients from contract
date. These extended payment term arrangements typically provide for date based payments over
periods ranging from 12 months to five years. Pursuant to SOP 97-2, because a significant portion
of the fee is due beyond one year, we have analyzed our history with these types of arrangements
and have concluded that we do have a standard business practice of using extended payment term
arrangements and have a long history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms
for arrangements with similar clients, product offerings, and economics without granting
concessions. Accordingly, we consider the fee to be fixed and determinable in these extended
payment term arrangements and, thus, the timing of revenue is not impacted by the existence of
extended payments. Some of these payment streams have been assigned on a non-recourse basis to
third party financing institutions. The Company has provided its usual and customary performance
guarantees to the third party financing institutions in connection with its on-going obligations
under the client contract. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company received total client cash
collections of $1,457,600,000, $1,200,595,000 and $937,600,000, respectively, of which
approximately 8%, 7% and 6% were received from third party client financing arrangements and
non-recourse payment assignments. Days sales outstanding decreased from 89 days at the end of 2005
to 87 days at the end of 2006. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements
represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 15% in 2006 and 23% in
2005, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems
grows.

Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of short-term investments of
$161,230,000 in 2005, the acquisition of businesses of $13,731,000 in 2006 and $119,683,000 in
2005, capitalized software development costs of $61,223,000 and
$62,523,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively and purchases
of capital equipment, land and buildings of $131,478,000 and $100,583,000 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. In 2006, a source of cash in investing activities consisted of net proceeds from the
sale of investment of $29,112,000.

The Company’s financing activities for 2006 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of
options of $21,704,000 and repayment of long-term debt of $30,783,000. In 2005 the Company’s
financing activities consisted primarily of the repayment of proceeds from the issuance of
long-term debt of $111,827,000 and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $51,744,000,
and repayment of a revolving line of credit and long-term debt of $91,848,000 and proceeds from a
revolving line of credit of $70,000,000.

In November 2005, the Company completed a £65,000,000 ($127,322,000 at December 30, 2006) private
placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven
equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006.

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in
three equal installments that commenced in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a



$39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning
December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Company’s credit
facility and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and
fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to
borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at December 30, 2006.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on
November 30, 2006 and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes.
The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only.
Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (8.25% at December 30, 2006)
or LIBOR (5.32% at December 30, 2006) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15%
if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, current
ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s
ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 2/10% is
payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit
matures on May 31, 2010. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its revolving
line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of VitalWorks.
(See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) This amount was paid in full as of December
31, 2005. At December 30, 2006, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and
had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at December 30, 2006.

In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, were paid in
full in 2006. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable
in six equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire
the Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital
improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain
net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on
the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006.

The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations
and, if necessary, its lines of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements
during 2007.

The following table represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial
commitments, excluding interest, as of December 30, 2006, except short-term purchase order
commitments arising in the ordinary course of business.

The Company is currently constructing a new data center on its campus in North Kansas City,
Missouri at an approximate cost of $60,000,000 of which approximately $34,000,000 has been spent as
of December 30, 2006. This commitment is not included in the above table. The construction is
expected to be completed in 2007.

The effects of inflation on the Company’s business during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not significant.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”), which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the
effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a
materiality assessment. SAB 108 allows registrants to record a one time cumulative effect
adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption to correct errors existing in
prior years deemed to be material in the current year that previously had been considered
immaterial. SAB 108 is effective for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2006. The Company
assessed the impact of adoption of SAB 108 on its consolidated
financial statements and determined there were no uncorrected
misstatements deemed to be material under the new interpretive
guidance provided in SAB108.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
(FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which defines the threshold for recognizing
the benefits of tax-return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be
sustained by the taxing authority. FIN 48 also prescribes a method for computing the tax benefit
of such tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. In addition, FIN 48 provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of FIN 48 on
its results of operations and its financial position and was required to adopt FIN 48 as of the
first day of the 2007 fiscal year.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding
the Company’s historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of
revenue and other significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. These
significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development,
concentrations, allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These
policies and the Company’s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and
under specific areas within this “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.” In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon
discussion of the Company’s accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software-related
services, using the residual method under SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
SOP No. 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) 101 “Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements” and SAB No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21
“Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). Key factors in
the Company’s revenue recognition model are management’s assessments that installation services are
essential to the functionality of the Company’s software whereas
implementation services are not; and the length of time it takes for
the Company to achieve its delivery and installation milestones for
its licensed software.
If the Company’s business model were to change such that
implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the Company’s software, the period of time over which the Company’s
licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally recognizes
combined revenue from the sale of its licensed software and related
installation services over two key milestones, delivery and installation,
based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation.
Additionally, if the time to achieve the Company’s delivery and installation milestones for its
licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated, its milestones would be adjusted and the
timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those
solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design, which is when the Company
determines that technological feasibility has been established. Thereafter, all software
development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are
available for general release, and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of
amortized cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross
future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing
and disposing of that product. Because the development of projected net future revenues related to
our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates, a
significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the realizability of our capitalized
software development costs. We historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in
computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference



between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years. We
expect that trend to continue in the future. If we missed our estimates of net future revenues by
up to 10%, the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired.
Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software
solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the
estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over
five years. The five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized
is an estimate based upon the Company’s forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized
costs. Historically, use of the Company’s software programs by its clients has exceeded five years
and is capable of being used a decade or more.

The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology
consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare
industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the healthcare
information technology market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product
enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized
software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

Concentrations

Substantially
all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks, physicians, hospitals
and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to
impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access
to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers.
The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future
results.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

If the creditworthiness of the Company’s clients were to weaken or the Company’s collections
results relative to historical experience were to decline, it could have a material adverse impact
on operations and cash flows.

Goodwill

The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually
or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where
it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company again assessed its goodwill
for impairment in the second quarters of 2006 and 2005 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired.
The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting
units for all periods. The Company completed nine acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to
June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately $106 million of goodwill that was not amortized in
accordance with SFAS 142. Goodwill amounted to $128,819,000 and $116,142,000 at December 30, 2006
and December 31, 2005, respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Company’s
reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected the Company’s goodwill
could be impaired, which would result in significant write-offs.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

At December 30, 2006, the Company had a £65,000,000 note payable outstanding through a private
placement with an interest rate of 5.54%. The note is payable in seven equal installments
beginning in November 2009. Because the borrowing is denominated in pounds, the Company is exposed
to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Great Britain
pound. Changes in the portion of the foreign-denominated debt that
was not designated as a hedging instrument were included in foreign
currency transaction gains and losses and were immaterial in 2006.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The Financial Statements and Notes required by this Item are submitted as a separate part of this
report.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.



Item 9.A. Controls and Procedures

a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report (the
“Evaluation Date”). They have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within
those entities and would be disclosed on a timely basis. The CEO and CFO have concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are effective, to
give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in
reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. They have
also concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

b)

There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
during the three months ended December 30, 2006 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.

c)

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and are effective at that reasonable assurance level. However, the Company’s
management can provide no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal control over financial reporting can prevent all errors and all fraud under all
circumstances. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
the Company have been or will be detected. The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended). The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006. In making this assessment, the Company’s
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company’s management has
concluded that, as of December 30, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on these criteria. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
that audited the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report has issued an
audit report on the Company’s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting, which is
included herein under
“Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.

Item 9.B. Other Information

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

,

appearing in Item 9.A. Controls and Procedures, that
Cerner Corporation (the Corporation) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Cerner Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion,
Cerner Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 30,
2006, and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Corporation) as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 30, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 30,
2006 and December 31, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” effective January 1, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Cerner Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cerner Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Nature of Operations

- The Company designs, develops, markets, installs, hosts and supports
software information technology, healthcare devices and content solutions for healthcare
organizations and consumers. The Company also provides a wide range of value-added services,
including implementing solutions as individual, combined or enterprise-wide systems; hosting
solutions in its data center; and clinical process optimization services.

(c)

Revenue Recognition

- Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and
administrative information systems and solutions. The components of the system sales revenues are
the licensing of computer software, installation, content subscriptions, transaction processing and
the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed software. The components of support, maintenance and
service revenues are software support and hardware maintenance, remote hosting and managed
services, training, consulting and implementation services. The Company provides several models
for the procurement of its clinical, financial and administrative information systems. The
predominant method is a perpetual software license agreement, project-related installation
services, implementation and consulting services, software support and either remote hosting
services or computer hardware and sublicensed software.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP)
97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff
Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) 101 “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” and SAB No. 104
“Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21 “Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). SOP 97-2, as amended, generally requires
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple-elements to be allocated to each element
based on the relative fair values of those elements if fair values exist for all elements of the
arrangement. Pursuant to SOP 98-9, the Company recognizes revenue from multiple-element software
arrangements using the residual method. Under the residual method, revenue is recognized in a
multiple-element arrangement when Company-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all
of the undelivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. professional services, software support,
hardware maintenance, hardware and sublicensed software), but does not exist for one or more of the
delivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. software solutions including project-related
installation services). The Company allocates revenue to each undelivered element in a
multiple-element arrangement based on the element’s respective fair value, with the fair value
determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately. Specifically, the Company
determines the fair value of the software support and maintenance,
hardware and sublicensed software support, remote hosting and
subscriptions portions of the arrangement based
on the renewal price for these services charged to clients; professional
services (including training and consulting) portion of the arrangement, other than installation services, based on hourly rates which
the Company charges for these services when sold apart from a software license; and, the hardware
and sublicensed software, based on the prices for these elements when they are sold separately from
the software. The residual amount of the fee after allocating revenue to the fair value of the
undelivered elements is attributed to the software solution, including project-related installation
services. If evidence of the fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a
license agreement, the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until these
elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be established.

The Company provides project-related installation services, which include project-scoping services,
conducting pre-installation audits and creating initial environments. Because installation
services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software, the Company recognizes
the software license and installation services fees over the software installation period using the
percentage of completion method pursuant to Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1),

Accounting



for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts,

as prescribed by
SOP 97-2. The Company measures the percentage of completion based on output measures which reflect
direct labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at completion of
installation. The installation services process length is dependent upon client specific factors
and can occur in a short period of time or range up to one year in length.

The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include consulting
activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services. These services
vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may
include additional database consulting, system configuration, project management, testing
assistance, network consulting, post conversion review and application management services.
Implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed to be essential to the
functionality of the software, and thus do not impact the timing of the software license
recognition, unless software license fees are tied to implementation milestones. In those
instances, the portion of the software license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred
until the related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non-forfeitable.
Implementation fees are recognized over the service period, which may extend from nine months to
three years for multi-phased projects.

Remote
hosting and managed services are marketed under long-term
arrangements generally over periods of five to ten
years. These services are typically provided to clients that have acquired a perpetual license for
licensed software and have contracted with the Company to host the software in its data center.
Under these arrangements, the client has the contractual right to take possession of the licensed
software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for
the client to either run the software on its own equipment or contract with another party unrelated
to the Company to host the software. Additionally, these services are not deemed to be essential
to the functionality of the licensed software or other elements of the arrangement and as such, the
Company accounts for these arrangements under SOP 97-2, as prescribed by EITF Issue No. 00-3,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use
Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware. The hosting and managed
services are recognized as the services are performed.

The Company also offers its solutions on an application service provider (“ASP”) or a term license
basis, making available Company software functionality on a remote processing basis from the
Company’s data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative support as well as
processing services. Revenue on software and services provided on an ASP or term license basis is
combined and recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract. The Company capitalizes related
direct costs consisting of third-party costs and direct software installation and implementation
costs associated with the initial set up of the client on the ASP
service. These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.

Software support fees are marketed under annual and multi-year arrangements and are recognized as
revenue ratably over the contracted support term. Hardware and
sublicensed software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contracted maintenance term.

Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the contracted terms.

Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized when title passes to the client.

Where the Company has contractually agreed to develop new or customized software code for a client
as a single element arrangement, the Company utilizes percentage of completion accounting in
accordance with SOP 81-1.



When revenue is
deferred all direct and incremental costs associated with the arrangement are capitalized and
amortized over the contractual term once revenue recognition commences.

In the United Kingdom the Company has contracted with a third party to customize software and
provide implementation and support services under a long term arrangement (nine years). Because
the arrangement requires customization and development of software, and fair value for the support
services does not exist in this arrangement, the entire arrangement is being accounted for as a
single unit of accounting under SOP 81-1. Also, because the Company believes it is reasonably
assured that no loss will be incurred under this arrangement, it is using the zero margin approach
of applying percentage-of-completion accounting until the software customization and development
services are completed. Once software customization and development services are completed, the
remaining unrecognized portion of the fee will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the
arrangement. As of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, approximately $69,000,000 and
$14,181,000, respectively of revenue and expense has been recognized in the accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, support, maintenance and other
services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed
and revenue has not been recognized. Long-term deferred revenue at December 30, 2006, represents
amounts received from license fees, maintenance and other services to be earned or provided
beginning in periods on or after December 29, 2007.

The Company incurs out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its client service activities,
primarily travel, which are reimbursed by its clients. The amounts of ”out-of-pocket” expenses and
equal amounts of related reimbursements were $39,051,000, $33,387,000 and $32,081,000 for the years
ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively.

The Company’s arrangements with clients typically include a deposit due upon contract signing and
date-based licensed software payment terms and payments based upon delivery for services, hardware
and sublicensed software. The Company has periodically provided long-term financing options to
creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has directly provided
extended payment terms to clients from contract date. These extended payment term arrangements
typically provide for date based payments over periods ranging from 12 months up to five years.
Pursuant to SOP 97-2, because a significant portion of the fee is due beyond one year, the Company
has analyzed its history with these types of arrangements and has concluded that it does have a
standard business practice of using extended payment term arrangements and have a long history of
successfully collecting under the original payment terms for arrangements with similar clients,
product offerings, and economics without granting concessions. Accordingly, the Company considers
the fee to be fixed and determinable in these extended payment term arrangements and, thus, the
timing of revenue is not impacted by the existence of extended payments. Some of these payment
streams have been assigned on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The
Company accounts for the assignment of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB
Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities. Provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company recognizes
revenue for these arrangements under its normal revenue recognition criteria, net of any payment
discounts from financing transactions.

The terms of the Company’s software license agreements with its clients generally provide for a
limited indemnification of such intellectual property against losses, expenses and liabilities
arising from third-party claims based on alleged infringement by the Company’s solutions of an
intellectual property right of such third party. The terms of such indemnification often limit the
scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace
or modify an infringing solution. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its



clients
for any losses related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to third-party intellectual
property infringement claims. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification
claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of
the corresponding agreements with its clients, the Company cannot determine
the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification
provisions.

(d)

Fiscal Year

- The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. All
references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years
unless otherwise noted.

(e)

Software Development Costs

- Costs incurred internally in creating computer software products
are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed
program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently
reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized
based on current and expected future revenue for each product with minimum annual amortization
equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the product. The
Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company
capitalized $60,943,000, $62,039,000 and $62,523,000, respectively, of total software development
costs of $262,163,000, $225,606,000 and $188,264,000, respectively. Amortization expense of
capitalized software development costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $45,750,000, $47,888,000 and
$47,740,000, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $303,010,000, $255,122,000 and
$207,382,000, respectively.

(f)

Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of short-term marketable securities with
original maturities less than 90 days.

(g)

Short-term Investments –

The Company’s short-term investments are primarily invested in
auction rate securities which are debt and preferred stock instruments having longer-dated (in most
cases, many years) legal maturities, but with interest rates that are generally reset every 28-49
days under an auction system. Because auction rate securities are frequently re-priced, they trade
in the market on par-in, par-out basis. Because the Company regularly liquidates its investments
in these securities for reasons including, among others, changes in market interest rates and
changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments, the Company has classified
these securities as available-for-sale securities. As available-for-sale securities, these
investments are carried at fair value, which approximates cost. Despite the liquid nature of these
investments, the Company categorizes them as short-term investments instead of cash and cash
equivalents due to the underlying legal maturities of such securities. However, they have been
classified as current assets as they are generally available to support the Company’s current
operations. There have been no realized gains or losses on these investments.

(h)

Inventory

- Inventory consists primarily of computer hardware and sub-licensed software held
for resale and is recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

(i)

Property and Equipment

- Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over periods of
two to 50 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using a straight-line method
over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives, which range from periods of two to 15
years.

(j)

Earnings per Common Share

– Basic earnings per share (EPS) excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of



the Company. A
reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share
computations is as follows:

the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because they were antidilutive.

(k)

Foreign Currency

- Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is
the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The
net exchange differences resulting from these translations are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain (loss) resulting from foreign currency
transactions is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations and amounted to $3,764,000, $2,700,000 and ($479,000) in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

(l)

Income Taxes

- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

(m)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets –

The Company accounts for goodwill under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator.
All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on
fair value. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of its fiscal
year. There was no impairment of goodwill in 2006 and 2005. The Company used a discounted cash
flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods tested. The
Company’s intangible assets, other than goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives, are
all subject to amortization and are summarized as follows:

At December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, goodwill of $112,312,000 and $101,262,000 has been
allocated to the Domestic segment respectively. The 2006 and 2005 amounts of goodwill allocated to
the Global segment was $16,507,000 and $14,880,000, respectively.

The Company recorded $1,362,000 of additional goodwill in the first quarter of 2006 to adjust for
the impact of accounting for deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets in
connection with previous stock acquisitions of businesses. At the date of acquisitions prior to
2006, the Company had not recognized deferred tax liabilities related to the difference between the
book and tax basis of certain intangible assets. The impact on net earnings related to this
oversight was insignificant.

(n)

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(o)

Concentrations

– Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments, are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Company’s
cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short-term marketable
securities, and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and,
therefore, bear minimal risk.



Substantially
all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks,
physicians, hospitals and other
healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to impact
these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access to
certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The
inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future
results.

(p)

Accounting for Share-based payments —

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No.
123(R), “Share-Based Payments,” using the modified prospective method of adoption. SFAS 123R
replaces SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS No. 123R addresses
the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and other third parties and
requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the
consolidated statement of earnings.

The impact of adopting SFAS 123R had the following cumulative effects:

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company applied the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 to account for its fixed-plan stock options. Under
this method, compensation expense was recorded on the date of grant only if the current market
price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. As previously allowed under SFAS 123,
the Company only adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123, which established a
fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. The following
is a reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings had the Company recorded
compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS 123
for the years ended 2005 and 2004.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —

The Company follows Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative Investments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended, to account for its derivatives and hedging activities.

The Company has issued foreign-denominated debt to manage its foreign currency exposure related to
its net investment in its subsidiary in the United Kingdom (UK). Beginning in 2006, at the
beginning of each quarterly period, the Company designated a portion (between £60 million and £63
million during the year) of its debt (£65 million), that is denominated in Great Britain Pounds, to
hedge its net investment in the UK. At December 30, 2006 approximately $9 million, net of
approximately $6 million of tax, of increases in the debt related to changes in the foreign
currency exchange rate were included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in the
portion of the foreign-denominated debt that was not designated as a hedging instrument were
included in foreign currency transaction gains and losses and were immaterial in 2006.

(s)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements —

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”),
which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
assessment. SAB 108 allows registrants to record a one time cumulative effect adjustment to
beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption to correct errors existing in prior years
deemed to be material in the current year that previously had been considered immaterial. SAB 108
is effective for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2006. The Company assessed the impact of
adoption of SAB 108 on its consolidated financial statements and determined there were no
uncorrected misstatements deemed to be material under the new interpretive guidance provided in SAB
108.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
(FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which defines the threshold for recognizing
the benefits of tax-return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be
sustained by the taxing authority. FIN 48 also prescribes a method for computing the tax benefit
of such tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. In addition, FIN 48 provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of FIN 48 on
its results of operations and its financial position and was required to adopt FIN 48 as of the
first day of the 2007 fiscal year.

2 Business Acquisitions and Divestiture

During the three years ended December 30, 2006, the Company completed six acquisitions, which were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The results of
each acquisition are included in the Company’s Consolidated
statements of operations from the date of each acquisition.

On July 5, 2006, the Company completed the purchase of Galt Associates, Inc. (“Galt”) for
$13,766,000, net of cash acquired. Galt is a provider of safety and risk management solutions for
pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. The acquisition of Galt will enhance
the Company’s LifeSciences portfolio by adding solutions and services that use medical event data
to monitor and manage the safety and effectiveness of various therapies. The allocation of the
purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identified tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, resulted in goodwill of $9,298,000 and $4,266,000 in intangible
assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods
between two and five years. Pro-forma results of operations have not
been presented because the effect of this acquisition was not
material to the Company.

On January 3, 2005, the Company completed the purchase of assets of the medical business division
of VitalWorks, Inc. for approximately $100,000,000, which was funded with existing cash of
approximately $65,000,000 and borrowings on the revolving line of credit of approximately
$35,000,000. The medical business consists of delivering and supporting physician practice
management, electronic medical record, electronic data interchange and emergency department
information solutions and related products and services to physician practices, hospital emergency
departments, management service organizations and other related entities. The acquisition of
VitalWorks’ medical division expanded the Company’s presence in the physician practice market.
$6,382,000 of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development that had not
reached technological feasibility and is reflected as a charge to earnings in 2005. The
allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identified tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulted in goodwill of $55,166,000 and
$43,450,000 in intangible assets that will be amortized over five years.



On March 15, 2004 the Company sold the referential content portion of Zynx Health Incorporated
(Zynx) for $12,000,000. The Company retained the life sciences portion of the business, which is
engaged in selling life sciences data to pharmaceutical companies for use in research, and the
Company retained the rights to use the Zynx content in its solutions going forward. The sale of
Zynx resulted in a gain of $3,023,000, and has been included in Other Income, net in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In connection with filing the Company’s 2004 income tax return, management determined that the sale
of Zynx in the first quarter of 2004 resulted in a tax capital loss. This tax capital loss was
carried back against capital gains previously realized resulting in tax benefits of $4,794,000.
The tax benefit was not recorded in the 2004 consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit, if properly recorded in 2004, would have increased 2004 net earnings by
$4,794,000. As the impact to prior year’s annual consolidated financial statements was not
material, the Company recorded this tax benefit of $4,794,000 in the third quarter of 2005 (an
increase to 2005 net earnings of $0.06 per share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31,
2005).

3 Receivables

Receivables consist of accounts receivable and contracts receivable. Accounts receivable represent
recorded revenues that have been billed. Contracts receivable represent recorded revenues that are
billable by the Company at future dates under the terms of a contract with a client. Billings and
other consideration received on contracts in excess of related revenues recognized are recorded as
deferred revenue. A summary of receivables is as follows:

Substantially all receivables are derived from sales and related support and maintenance of
the Company’s clinical, administrative and financial information systems and solutions to
healthcare providers located throughout the United States and in certain foreign countries.
Included in receivables at the end of 2006 and 2005 are amounts due from healthcare providers
located in foreign countries of $76,805,000 and $32,533,000, respectively. Consolidated revenues
include foreign sales of $207,367,000, $113,314,000 and $62,426,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Consolidated long-lived assets at the end of 2006 and 2005 include foreign
long-lived assets of $15,055,000 and $9,723,000, respectively. Revenues and long-lived assets from
any one foreign country are not material.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally does not require
collateral from its clients. The Company provides an allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts based on specific identification, historical experience and management’s judgment. At the
end of 2006 and 2005 the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts was $14,628,000 and
$18,855,000, respectively. The decline in the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts from
2005 to 2006 was primarily driven by the improved aging of receivables, as reflected in a lower
level of past due accounts as well write-off of accounts for which specific reserves had been
established.

During 2006 and 2005, the Company received total client cash collections of $1,457,600,000 and
$1,200,600,000, respectively, of which $108,814,000 and $82,355,000 were received from third party
arrangements with non-recourse payment assignments.

5 Indebtedness

In November 2005, the Company completed a £65,000,000 ($127,322,000 at December 30, 2006) private
placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven
equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006.

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in
three equal installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000
principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009.
The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for
general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge
coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur
liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December
30, 2006.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on
November 30, 2006 and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes.
The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only.
Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (8.25% at December 30, 2006)
or LIBOR (5.32% at December 30, 2006) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15%
if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, current
ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s
ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 2/10% is
payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit
matures on May 31, 2010. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its
revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of
VitalWorks. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) This amount was paid in full
as of December 31, 2005. At December 30, 2006, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under
this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006.



In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000
principal amount of 7.14% were paid in full in 2006. The Series B
Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual
installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Company’s
existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to
strengthen the Company’s cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current
ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s
ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with
all covenants at December 30, 2006.

In March 2004, the Company issued a $7,500,000 promissory note to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of
which $2,500,000 was repaid in October 2004. The balance of the note will be payable on April 30,
2007.

The
Company also has capital lease obligations amounting to $2,311,000, payable over the next three

During 2006, the Company had two long-term incentive plans from which it could issue grants.

Under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan F, the Company is authorized to grant to associates,
directors and consultants 4,000,000 shares of common stock awards taking into account the
stock-split effective January 10, 2006. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options,
restricted stock and performance shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock and performance unit awards which may be payable in the form of common stock or cash.
However, not more than 1,000,000 of such shares will be available for granting any types of grants
other than options or stock appreciation rights. Options under Plan F are exercisable at a price
not less than fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the Stock Option Committee.
Options under this plan typically vest over a period of five years as determined by the Stock
Option Committee and are exercisable for periods of up to 25 years.

Long-Term Incentive Plan G was approved by the Company’s shareholders on May 28, 2004. Under the
2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan G, the Company is authorized to grant to associates and directors
4,000,000 shares of common stock awards taking into account the stock-split effective January 10,
2006. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted stock and performance
shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and performance
unit awards which may be payable in the form of common stock or cash. Options under Plan G are
exercisable at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the
Stock Option Committee. Options under this plan typically vest over a period of five years as
determined by the Stock Option Committee and are exercisable for periods of up to 12 years.

In addition to the stock option plans, the Company has also granted 1,708,170 other non-qualified
stock options over time through December 30, 2006, under separate agreements to employees and
certain third parties. These options are exercisable at a price equal to or greater than the fair
market value on the date of grant. These options vest over periods of up to six years and are
exercisable for periods of up to ten years.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice
option-pricing model for 2006 and using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for 2005 and 2004
based on the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities under the lattice
model are based on an equal weighting of implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s
shares and historical volatility. Expected volatilities under the Black-Scholes model were based
entirely on historical volatility. The Company uses historical data to estimate stock option
exercise and associate departure behavior used in the lattice model; groups of associates
(executives and non-executives) that have similar historical behavior are considered separately for
valuation purposes. The expected term of stock options granted is derived from the output of the
lattice option-pricing model and represents the period of time that stock options granted are
expected to be outstanding; the range given below results from certain groups of associates
exhibiting different post-vesting behaviors. The expected term under the Black-Scholes model was
determined using the simplified method of estimating the term as described in Staff



Accounting
Bulletin 107. The risk-free rate used in 2006, 2005 and 2004 is based on the zero-coupon U.S.
Treasury bond with a term equal to the expected term of the awards.

The Company established an Associate Stock Purchase Plan (ASPP) in 2001, which qualifies under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Each individual employed by the Company and associates
of the Company’s United States based subsidiaries, except as provided below, shall be eligible to
participate in the Plan (“Participants”). The following individuals shall be excluded from
participation: (a) persons who, as of the beginning of a purchase period under the Plan, have been
continuously employed by the Company or its domestic subsidiaries for less than two weeks; (b)
persons who, as of the beginning of a purchase period, own directly or indirectly, or



hold options
or rights to acquire under any agreement or Company plan, an aggregate of 5% or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all outstanding shares of all classes of Company Common Stock;
and, (c) persons who are customarily employed by the Company for less than 20 hours per week or for
less than five months in any calendar year. Participants may elect to make contributions from 1%
to 20% of compensation to the ASPP, subject to annual
limitations determined by the Internal Revenue Service. Participants may purchase Company Common
Stock at a 15% discount on the last day of the purchase period. The purchase of the Company’s
common stock is made through the ASPP on the open market and subsequently reissued to the
associates. Under FAS123R, the difference of the open market purchase and the participant’s
purchase price is being recognized as compensation expense.

The Company granted 15,000 shares of restricted stock from Plan F to members of the Board of
Directors on July 6, 2004 valued at $21.16 and vesting on May 26, 2005. The Company made
additional grants of restricted stock from Plan F to members of the Board of Directors during 2005.
5,000 shares of restricted stock were granted on April 4, 2005 valued at $26.19, vesting as
follows: 1,666 on February 2, 2006; 1,666 on February 2, 2007; and 1,668 on February 2, 2008.
25,000 shares of restricted stock were granted on June 3, 2005 valued at $31.41, vesting on May 25,
2006. The Company granted 5,000 shares of restricted stock from Plan G to a member of the Board of
Directors on June 3, 2005 valued at $31.41, vesting as follows: 1,666 on May 25, 2006; 1,666 on May
24, 2007; and 1,668 on May 22, 2008. The Company granted 5,000 shares of restricted stock from

of the Board of Directors on July 25, 2006 valued at $38.75 and vesting on May 24, 2007. All
grants were valued at the fair market value on the date of grant and vest provided the recipient
has continuously served on the Board of Directors through such vesting date or in the case of an
employee provided that performance measures are attained. The expense associated with these grants
is being recognized over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date. The Company
recognized expenses related to the restricted stock of $853,000 and
$780,000 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

8 Foundations Retirement Plan

The Cerner Corporation Foundations Retirement Plan (the Plan) is established under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code. All associates over age 18 and not a member of an excluded class are
eligible to participate. Participants may elect to make pretax contributions from 1% to 80% of
eligible compensation to the Plan, subject to annual limitations determined by the Internal Revenue
Service. Participants may direct contributions into mutual funds, a money



market fund, or a
Company stock fund. The Company makes matching contributions to the Plan, on behalf of
participants, in an amount equal to 33% of the first 6% of the participant’s salary contribution.
The Company’s expense for the plan amounted to $7,791,000, $7,130,000 and $5,994,000 for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

The Company added a discretionary match to the Plan in 2000. Contributions are based on attainment
of established earnings per share goals for the year or the established financial metric
for the plan. Only participants in the Plan are eligible to receive the discretionary match
contribution. For the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 the Company expensed $6,638,000, $5,783,000
and $5,186,000 for discretionary distributions, respectively.

Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income
over the periods which the deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible, as well as the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, management believes it is more likely than not the
Company will realize the benefit of these deductible differences. At December 30, 2006, the
Company has net operating loss carryforwards subject to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code
for Federal income tax purposes of $21.3 million which are available to offset future Federal
taxable income, if any, through 2020.



The effective income tax rates for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 34%, 36%, and 40%, respectively. These

The 2006
tax expense includes the recognition of approximately $1,994,000 of
tax benefits for items related to prior periods. The adjustments were
recorded primarily to recognize tax credits taken on prior income tax
returns and to correct an error in prior years’ effective
foreign tax rate. These differences have accumulated over several
years, and the impact to any one of these prior years is
insignificant.

Income taxes payable are reduced by the tax benefit resulting from disqualifying dispositions
of stock acquired under the Company’s stock option plans. The 2006, 2005 and 2004 benefits of
$9,372,000, $30,289,000 and $9,191,000, respectively, are treated as increases to additional
paid-in capital.

10 Related Party Transactions

The Company leases an airplane from a company owned by Mr. Neal L. Patterson and Mr. Clifford W.
Illig. the Company’s Chairman/CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board,
respectively. The airplane is leased on a per mile basis with no minimum usage guarantee. The lease rate
is believed to approximate fair market value for this type of aircraft. During 2006 and 2005,
respectively, the Company paid an aggregate of $670,000 and $812,000 for the rental of the
airplane. The airplane is used principally by Mr. Paul Black,
Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Trace Devanny, President, to make client
visits.

11 Commitments

The Company leases space to unrelated parties in its North Kansas City headquarters complex and in
other business locations under noncancelable operating leases. Included in other revenues is
rental income of $305,000, $583,000 and $63,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company is committed under operating leases for office space and computer equipment through
December 2023. Rent expense for office and warehouse space for the Company’s regional and global
offices for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $11,391,000, $9,056,000 and
$6,470,000, respectively.

12 Segment Reporting

The
Company has two operating segments, Domestic and Global. Beginning in
2006, we began allocating certain expenses related to our managed
services that were previously classified as Other to the geographic
segment to which they relate. As a
result, the prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the change in reportable
segments. Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and administrative
information systems and solutions. The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party
consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and
software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware



maintenance
and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred
by the geographic business segments consist of sales and client service expenses including salaries
of sales and client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses.
Performance of the segments is assessed at the operating earnings level and, therefore, the segment
operations have been presented as such. “Other” includes revenues not generated by the operating
segments and expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative and
depreciation that have not been allocated to the operating segments. The Company does not track
assets by geographical business segment.

Accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those used on a
consolidated basis. The following table presents a summary of the operating information for the
years ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005.

13 Accrued Vacation Pay Adjustment

In conjunction with a review of the process for calculating the liability for accrued vacation pay
at the end of the third quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the liability on the balance
sheet relating to periods prior to 2004 was understated by $3,346,000. While the Company was fully
accrued for all vested vacation that would be subject to payout upon termination, the Company
understated the liability for accumulated vacation that could be used in subsequent periods by
associates in excess of the vested amount payable upon termination.

The expense, if properly recorded in 2000 through 2003, would have increased 2003 net earnings by
$0.1 million and would have decreased net earnings by $0.4 million in 2002, $0.6 million in 2001,
and $1.2 million in 2000. The cumulative impact on net earnings is a decrease of $2.1 million for
this four-year period. The impact on 2004 net earnings is a positive $8 thousand. As the impact
to prior year’s annual financial statements was not material, Cerner recorded additional expense of
$3,346,000, $2,076,000 million after-tax, in the 2004 third quarter to appropriately reflect the
liability as of October 2, 2004. The Company has revised its process for calculating the liability
for accumulated vacation to accurately report this information in the future.

14 Stock Split

On December 14, 2005 the Company’s Board of Directors announced a two-for-one stock split, payable
on January 9, 2006 in the form of a one hundred percent (100%)
stock dividend to shareholders of
record on December 30, 2005. In connection with the stock split, a portion of the distribution of
the stock dividend came from 1,502,999 treasury shares previously reflected in the consolidated
balance sheets. All share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted for all periods
presented to reflect the stock split including the use of treasury shares, as if the stock split
had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The number of common shares issued
and outstanding at December 31, 2005 previously presented in the Company’s 2005 Annual Report on
Form 10-K was overstated by 1,502,999 shares. This has been corrected in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet and statement of changes in equity noting the correct number of common shares issued and outstanding at
December 31, 2005, January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004
was 77,011,464, 73,273,938 and 71,108,730, respectively.
