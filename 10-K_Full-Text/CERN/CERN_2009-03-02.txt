Item 1. Business

Overview

Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the “Company”) is a Delaware business corporation formed in 1980.
The Company’s corporate headquarters are located at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City,
Missouri 64117. Its telephone number is 816.221.1024. The Company’s Web site address, which is used
by the Company to communicate important business information concerning the Company, can be
accessed at: www.cerner.com. The Company makes available free of charge, on or through its Web
site, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K
and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is
electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cerner is a supplier of healthcare information technology (HIT) solutions, healthcare devices and
related services. Organizations ranging from single-doctor practices, to hospitals, corporations,
and local, regional and national governments use

Cerner

®

solutions and services to make
healthcare safer, more efficient and of higher quality.

The Company’s software solutions have been designed and developed on the unified

Cerner
Millennium

®

architecture. This person-centric solution framework combines clinical,
financial and management information systems. It provides secure access to an individual’s
electronic medical record at the point of care and organizes and proactively delivers information
to meet the specific needs of the physician, nurse, laboratory technician, pharmacist or other care
provider, front- and back-office professionals and even consumers.

The Company’s

CareAware

™

architecture extends these links by connecting information from
various devices to the clinician workflow and electronic medical record.

Cerner also offers a broad range of services, including implementation and training, remote
hosting, operational management services, support and maintenance, healthcare data analysis,
clinical process optimization, transaction processing, employer clinics and employer health plan
third party administrator (TPA) services.

The Healthcare and Healthcare IT Industry

The turbulence in the worldwide economy has impacted almost all industries. While healthcare is
not immune to economic cycles, we believe it is more resilient than most segments of the economy.
The impact of the current economic conditions on our existing and prospective clients has been
mixed. We continue to see organizations that are doing fairly well operationally, but many are
dealing with a reduction in their foundation investment portfolios caused by the general market
decline. In addition, organizations with a large dependency on Medicaid populations are being
impacted by the challenging financial condition of many state governments.

The result of these challenges is that healthcare organizations are becoming more selective
regarding where they invest capital, resulting in a focus on strategic spending that generates a
return on their investment. In the current environment, many HIT solutions are viewed as being
more strategic to healthcare organizations than other possible purchases because the solutions
offer quick return on investment. HIT solutions also play an important role in healthcare by
improving safety, efficiency and reducing cost. And most healthcare providers also recognize that
they must invest in HIT to meet current and future regulatory, compliance and government
reimbursement models.

Overall, while the economy has certainly impacted and could continue to impact our business, we
believe there are several macro trends that are good for the HIT industry. One example is the
continued need to curb the growth of U.S. healthcare spending, which is estimated at more than $2
trillion or 17 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. In the U.S., politicians and policy makers
agree that the current rate of growth of our healthcare system is unsustainable. And leaders of
both parties say the intelligent use of information systems will improve health outcomes and,
correspondingly, drive down costs. They cite a 2005 study by RAND Corp., which found that the
widespread adoption of HIT in the U.S. could cut healthcare costs by $162 billion. Although policy



experts have different opinions on the rates of HIT adoption and how quickly benefits can be
realized, there is consensus that HIT has the potential to contribute to significant cost savings.

Another positive for the U.S. healthcare and HIT industries is the fact that the Obama
administration appears likely to follow through on campaign commitments to pursue broad healthcare
reform aimed at improving healthcare’s systemic issues. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,
which became law on February 17, 2009, includes more than $19 billion to help healthcare
organizations modernize operations through the acquisition and wide-spread use of HIT. While Cerner
does not expect an immediate boost from these HIT provisions, the longer-term potential could be
significant. Our large footprint in hospitals and physician practices, together with our proven
ability to deliver value, positions us well to benefit from these incentives. Additionally, the Act
is expected to provide states with badly needed Medicaid dollars, which should help improve the
financial health of hospitals and potentially free them to make HIT investments.

It is also important to note that most other countries are also grappling with increasing
healthcare spending, safety concerns and inefficient care, a fact that creates a favorable
international market for HIT solutions and related services.

In summary, while the current economic environment has impacted our business, we believe the
fundamental value proposition of HIT remains intact. And the HIT industry will likely benefit from
the increased recognition by healthcare providers and governments that HIT contributes to safer and
more efficient healthcare.

Cerner Vision

Cerner’s vision has evolved from a fundamental thought: Healthcare should revolve around the
individual, not the encounter. This concept led to Cerner’s vision of a Community Health Model and
the creation of the unified

Cerner Millennium

architecture, the Company’s person-centric,
enterprise-wide solution framework. The Community Health Model encompasses four steps:

Automate the Care Process

Cerner offers a longitudinal, person-centric electronic medical record, giving clinicians
electronic access to the right information at the right time and place to achieve the optimal
health outcome.

Connect the Person

Cerner is dedicated to building a personal health system. Medical information and care regimens
accessible from home empower consumers to effectively manage their conditions and adhere to
treatment plans, creating a new medium between physicians and individuals.

Structure the Knowledge

Cerner is dedicated to building systems that help bring the best science to every medical decision
by structuring, storing and studying the content surrounding each care episode to achieve optimal
clinical and financial outcomes.

Close the Loop

Incorporating a medical discovery into daily practice can take as long as 10 years. Cerner is
dedicated to building systems that implement evidence-based medicine, reducing the average time
from the discovery of an improved method to the change in the standard of care.

As our vision evolves, Cerner expects medicine will become increasingly personalized and technology
more accessible. As such, we are creating new solutions for large user communities, including
strategies to:

•

Connect all stakeholders in the healthcare system, including payers (employers and
governments), providers and consumers

•

Remove clinical, financial and administrative friction

•

Create a secure, transparent and open network for data sharing to improve disease
management and facilitate personalized medicine



Achieving this vision will require continued leverage of the

Cerner Millennium

architecture and
ongoing expansion of our solutions and services, as discussed below.

Cerner Strategy and Execution

The Company’s business strategies are anchored by our industry-leading solution and device
architectures

,

the breadth and depth of our solutions and services, and, most importantly, the
success of our clients.

Leveraging these strengths, Cerner is working to increase market penetration in both the domestic
and global markets by: developing and cross-selling innovative solutions, devices and services to
existing and new clients; offering physician practices high-value solutions with low up-front and
recurring costs; using clinical databases to help pharmaceutical companies monitor safety and speed
drug approval; reducing healthcare friction for employers and
connecting healthcare and medical devices.

Examples of these strategies include:

As we work to improve these solutions, devices and services, we remain focused on making
implementations more efficient and predictable. Our goal is to reduce the total cost of ownership
for our clients. By automating the implementation and management of the

Cerner Millennium

platform
through

Bedrock

®

,  together with our best-practice implementation approach,

MethodM

®

, we
can reduce the total hours of effort needed to implement a system while also making the outcome
more predictable. We also can reduce the upfront hardware costs and ongoing technology risks
through our remote-hosted, managed services offering,

CernerWorks

.

™

Additionally, we offer a surveillance system called the

Lights On Network

™

that
identifies system performance issues in real time and has the ability to predict issues that could
create system vulnerability. With more than 300 participating clients,

Lights On

has become an
evidence-based network that enhances system performance and allows our clients to maximize the
value they gain from our systems.

Through these strategies above and our ongoing focus on improving our clients’ experience, we aim
to deliver the optimal client experience, nurturing important relationships with existing clients
and creating opportunities to establish new ones.

Software Development

Cerner continues to build upon the success of the

Cerner Millennium

2007 software release that
became generally available in late 2006. Our client base has been rapidly adopting the release, and
based on feedback from clients, Cerner decided to leverage the

Cerner Millennium

2007 platform for
all future innovations and enhancements through the end of the decade. Understanding the effort
involved with major release upgrades and the impact on our clients, this strategy will allow
clients already using

Cerner Millennium

2007 to take advantage of new enhancements and
functionality without requiring a major code upgrade.



We commit significant resources to developing new health information system solutions. As of
January 3, 2009, approximately 2,300 associates were engaged in research and development
activities. Total expenditures for the development and enhancement of our software solutions and

RxStation

medication dispensing devices were approximately $291,368,000, $283,086,000, and
$262,163,000 during the 2008, 2007, and 2006 fiscal years, respectively. These figures include both
capitalized and non-capitalized portions and exclude amounts amortized for financial reporting
purposes.

As discussed above, continued investment in research and development remains a core element of
Cerner’s strategy. This will include ongoing enhancement of our core solutions and development of
new solutions and services.

The Company is committed to maintaining open attributes in its system architecture to achieve
operability in a diverse set of technical and application environments. The Company strives to
design its systems to co-exist with disparate applications developed and supported by other
suppliers.

Sales and Marketing

The markets for

Cerner

HIT solutions, healthcare devices and services include integrated delivery
networks, physician groups and networks, managed care organizations, hospitals, medical centers,
free-standing reference laboratories, home health agencies, blood banks, imaging centers,
pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, employers and public health organizations. To date, a
substantial portion of system sales have been in clinical solutions in hospital-based provider
organizations. The

Cerner Millennium

architecture is highly scalable. Organizations ranging from
several-doctor physician practices, to community hospitals, to complex integrated delivery
networks, to local, regional and national government agencies use our

Cerner Millennium

solutions.

We design all

Cerner Millennium

solutions to operate on HP or IBM platforms, allowing Cerner to be
price competitive across the full size and organizational structure range of healthcare providers.
The sale of a

Cerner

software health information system usually takes approximately nine to 18
months, from the time of initial contact to the signing of a contract.

Our executive marketing management is located in our North Kansas City, Missouri headquarters,
while our client representatives are deployed across the United States and globally. In addition to
the U.S., the Company, through subsidiaries and joint ventures, has sales associates and/or offices
in Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, China (Hong Kong), India, Ireland, Malaysia, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. Cerner’s consolidated revenues include
non-U.S. sales of $368,518,000, $290,677,000, and $207,367,000 for the 2008, 2007, and 2006 fiscal
years, respectively.

The Company supports its sales force with technical personnel who perform demonstrations of

Cerner

solutions and services and assist clients in determining the proper hardware and software
configurations. The Company’s primary direct marketing strategy is to generate sales contacts from
its existing client base and through presentations at industry seminars and tradeshows. Cerner
markets the

PowerWorks

solutions, offered on a subscription basis, directly to the physician
practice market using telemarketing and through existing acute care clients that are looking to
extend

Cerner

solutions to affiliated physicians. Cerner attends a number of major tradeshows each
year and sponsors executive user conferences, which feature industry experts who address the HIT
needs of large healthcare organizations.

Client Services

Substantially all of

Cerner’s

HIT software solutions clients enter into software maintenance
agreements with us for support of their

Cerner

systems. In addition to immediate software support
in the event of problems, these agreements allow clients the use of new releases of the

Cerner

solutions covered by maintenance agreements. Each client has 24-hour access to the client support
team located at Cerner’s world headquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri and the Company’s global
support organization in England.

Most Cerner clients who buy hardware through Cerner also enter into hardware maintenance agreements
with Cerner. These arrangements normally provide for a fixed monthly fee for specified services. In
the majority of cases, Cerner subcontracts hardware maintenance to the hardware manufacturer.
Cerner also offers a set of managed services that include remote hosting, operational management
services and disaster recovery.



Backlog

At January 3, 2009, Cerner had a contract backlog of approximately $2,907,762,000 as compared to
approximately $2,712,195,000 at December 29, 2007. Such backlog represents system sales and
services from signed contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. At January 3, 2009,
the Company had approximately $141,014,000 of contracts receivable compared to $129,604,000 at the
end of 2007, which represents revenues recognized but not yet billable under the terms of the
contract. At January 3, 2009, Cerner had a software support and maintenance backlog of
approximately $580,915,000 as compared to approximately $541,095,000 at December 29, 2007. Such
backlog represents contracted software support and hardware maintenance services for a period of 12
months. The Company estimates that approximately 38 percent of the aggregate backlog at January 3,
2009 of $3,488,677,000 will be recognized as revenue during 2009.

Competition

The market for HIT solutions, devices and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and
subject to rapid technological change. Our principal existing competitors in the healthcare
solutions and services market include: Computer Programs and Systems, Inc., Eclipsys Corporation,
Epic Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare Technologies, iSoft Corporation (an IBA Health Group
Company), McKesson Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. (“Meditech”), Misys Healthcare
Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, each of which offers a suite of
software solutions that compete with many of our software solutions and services. Other
competitors focus on only a portion of the market that Cerner addresses. For example, competitors
such as Capgemini, Computer Sciences Corp., Deloitte LLP, IBM Corporation and Perot Systems offer
HIT services that compete directly with our consulting services. Allscripts-Misys Healthcare
Solutions, Inc., athenahealth, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Inc., Emdeon Corporation and Quality Systems,
Inc. offer solutions to the physician practice market but do not currently have a significant
presence in the health systems and independent hospital market. We view our principal competitors
in the healthcare device market to include: Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation, Omnicell,
Inc. and Royal Philips Electronics; and we view our principal competitors in the healthcare
transactions market to include: Accenture, Emdeon Corporation, McKesson Corporation, ProxyMed, Inc.
(d/b/a MedAvant Healthcare Solutions) and The TriZetto Group, Inc., with almost all of these
competitors being substantially larger or having more experience and market share than us in their
respective market. In addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, large
information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, start-up companies,
managed care companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive
software solutions, devices or services. The pace of change in the HIT market is rapid and there
are frequent new software solutions, devices or service introductions, enhancements and evolving
industry standards and requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this
market include the breadth and quality of solution and service offerings, the stability of the
solution provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems and devices, the
ongoing support for the systems and devices and the potential for enhancements and future
compatible software solutions and devices.

Number of Employees (“Associates”)

As of January 3, 2009, the Company employed approximately 7,500 associates worldwide.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risks Related to Cerner Corporation



We may be subject to product-related liabilities.

Many of our software solutions, healthcare
devices or services (including life sciences/research services) provide data for use by healthcare
providers in providing care to patients. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage in an
amount that we believe is sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that such coverage
will cover any particular claim that has been brought or that may be brought in the future, prove
to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at
all. A successful material claim brought against us, if uninsured or under-insured, could
materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Product-related
claims could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients, limit our ability to obtain
new clients, result in revenues loss, create potential liabilities for our clients and us and
increase insurance and other operational costs.

We may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties.

Our software solutions and healthcare
devices, particularly the

Cerner Millennium

versions, are very complex. Our software solutions and
healthcare devices may contain coding or other errors, especially when first introduced. We have
discovered errors in our software solutions and healthcare devices after their introduction. Our software solutions and healthcare devices are intended for use in
collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.
Therefore, users of our software solutions and healthcare devices have a greater sensitivity to
errors than the market for software products and devices generally. Our client agreements
typically provide warranties concerning material errors and other matters. Failure of a client’s

Cerner

software solutions and/or healthcare devices to meet these warranties could constitute a
material breach under the client agreement, allowing the client to terminate the agreement and
possibly obtain a refund and/or damages, or might require us to incur additional expense in order
to make the software solution or healthcare device meet these criteria. Our client agreements
generally limit our liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in
certain jurisdictions or circumstances. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage in an
amount that we believe is sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that such coverage
will cover any particular claim that has been brought or that may be brought in the future, prove
to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at
all. A successful material claim or series of claims brought against us, if uninsured or
under-insured, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may experience interruption at our data centers or client support facilities.

We perform data
center and/or hosting services for certain clients, including the storage of critical patient and
administrative data. In addition, we provide support services to our clients through various
client support facilities. We have invested in reliability features such as multiple power feeds,
multiple backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines, as well as technical and
physical security safeguards, and structured our operations to reduce the likelihood of
disruptions. However, complete failure of all generators, impairment of all telecommunications
lines, damage (environmental, accidental, intentional or pandemic) to the buildings, the equipment
inside the buildings housing our data centers, the client data contained therein and/or the
personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively
impact clients who depend on us for data center and system support services. Any interruption in
operations at our data centers and/or client support facilities could damage our reputation, cause
us to lose existing clients, hurt our ability to obtain new clients, result in revenue loss, create
potential liabilities for our clients and us and increase insurance and other operating costs.

Our proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of
intellectual property rights of others, or may be infringed or misappropriated by others.

We rely
upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure
agreements, confidentiality agreements with third parties and technical measures to maintain the
confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information. We also rely on trademark and
copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. We
continue to develop our patent portfolio of U.S. and global patents, but currently have a limited
number of issued patents. Despite our protective measures and intellectual property rights, we may
not be able to adequately protect against copying, reverse-engineering, misappropriation,
infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property.

In addition, we are routinely involved in intellectual property infringement or misappropriation
claims and we expect this activity to continue or even increase as the number of competitors,
patents and patent enforcement organizations in the HIT market increases, the functionality of our
software solutions and services expands, and we



enter new markets such as healthcare device
innovation, healthcare transactions and life sciences. These claims, even if not meritorious, are
expensive to defend. If we become liable to third parties for infringing or misappropriating their
intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop
alternative technology, obtain a license and/or cease using, selling, licensing, implementing and
supporting the solutions, devices and services that violate the intellectual property rights.

We are subject to risks associated with our non-U.S. operations.

We market, sell and service our
solutions, devices and services globally. We have established offices around the world, including
in: the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region. We will continue to expand
our non-U.S. operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect non-U.S.
sales and support channels. Our business is generally transacted in the local functional currency.
In some countries, our success will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local
partners. There is a risk that we may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, we
may not be able to maintain or increase non-U.S. market demand for our solutions, devices and
services.

Non-U.S. operations are subject to inherent risks, and our future results could be adversely
affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include, but are not limited
to:

Our failure to effectively hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could
unfavorably affect our performance.

We utilize derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Some of these instruments and contracts may
involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. For additional information about risk on financial instruments, see Item 7
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation under Market
Risk. Further, our financial results from non-U.S. operations may be negatively affected if we
fail to execute or improperly hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations.

Our success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel.

To remain competitive in
our industries, we must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing,
consulting and technical personnel, including executives, consultants, programmers and systems
architects skilled in the HIT, healthcare devices, healthcare transactions and life sciences
industries and the technical environments in which



our solutions, devices and services are needed.
Competition for such personnel in our industries is intense in both the United States and abroad.
Our failure to attract additional qualified personnel to meet our non-U.S. personnel needs could
have a material adverse effect on our prospects for long-term growth. Our success is dependent to
a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management, sales, marketing, consulting
and technical personnel. The unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact
on our business and results of operations, and could potentially inhibit development and delivery
of our solutions, devices and services and market share advances.

We rely significantly on third party suppliers.

We license or purchase intellectual property and
technology (such as software, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors,
and incorporate software, hardware, and/or content into or sell it in conjunction with our
solutions, devices and services, some of which are critical to the operation and delivery of our
solutions, devices and services. For instance, we currently depend on Microsoft and IBM Websphere
technologies for portions of the operational abilities of our

Millennium

solutions. Our remote
hosting business also relies on a single or a limited number of suppliers for certain functions of
this business, such as Oracle database technologies, CITRIX technologies and CISCO network
technologies.

Most of the software licenses we have expire within one to five years, can be renewed only by
mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the
breach within a specified period of time. Most of these third party software licenses are
non-exclusive; therefore, our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered
by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us.

If any of the third party suppliers were to change product offerings, cease actively supporting the
technologies, fail to update and enhance the technologies to keep pace with changing industry
standards, encounter technical difficulties in the continuing development of these technologies,
significantly increase prices or terminate our licenses or supply contracts, we would need to seek
alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure
continued performance of our solutions, devices and services. Such alternatives may not be
available on attractive terms, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual
property or technology provided by our existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing, purchasing or
maintaining the third party intellectual property or technology significantly increases, our gross
margin levels could significantly decrease. In addition, interruption in functionality of our
solutions, devices and services as a result of changes in third party suppliers could adversely
affect future sales of solutions, devices and services.

We intend to continue strategic business acquisitions, which are subject to inherent risks.

In
order to expand our solutions, device offerings and services and grow our market and client base,
we may continue to seek and complete strategic business acquisitions that we believe are
complementary to our business. Acquisitions have inherent risks which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including, but not
limited to: 1) failure to successfully integrate the business and financial operations, services,
intellectual property, solutions or personnel of an acquired business and to maintain uniform
standard controls, policies and procedures; 2) diversion of management’s attention from other
business concerns; 3) entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience; 4)
failure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets; 5) loss of clients or key
personnel; 6) incurrence of debt and/or assumption of known and unknown liabilities; 7) write-off
of software development costs, goodwill, client lists and amortization of expenses related to
intangible assets; 8) dilutive issuances of equity securities; and, 9) accounting deficiencies that
could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of an acquired company,
including issues related to internal control over financial reporting and the time and cost
associated with remedying such deficiencies. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired
businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to these acquisitions, we may
not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such
acquired businesses.

Risks Related to the Healthcare Information Technology, Healthcare Device and Healthcare
Transaction Industry



The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences.

For
example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) continues to have
a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized
transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the
appropriate level of privacy of protected health information. These regulatory factors affect the
purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations. Federal and state legislatures
have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the
federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. These
programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower
reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants
operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing
investment decisions, including investments in our solutions and services.

Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with
greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price
reductions for our solutions and services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, our client
base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of
landing new client relationships becomes greater.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local, state and federal level.

We are subject
to a significant and wide-ranging number of regulations both within the U.S. and elsewhere, such
as, regulations in the areas of: healthcare fraud, e-prescribing, claims processing and
transmission, medical devices, the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability
standards.

Healthcare Fraud.

Federal and state governments continue to increase their scrutiny over practices
involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by
Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our healthcare provider clients are
subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, prohibit the direct
or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or arranging for or
recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state
healthcare programs. Federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and remedies
to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation on our
clients is difficult to predict. Many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be
applicable to us, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could
broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the
way in which they deal with us. If such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to us
and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to sanctions
or liability, including exclusion from government health programs, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

E-Prescribing.

The use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing, electronic
routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law. States
have differing prescription format requirements, which we have programmed into our software. In
addition, in November 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations by
CMS related to “E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program” (“E-Prescribing Regulations”).
These E-Prescribing Regulations were mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003. The E-Prescribing Regulations set forth standards for the transmission
of electronic prescriptions. The final regulations adopted two standards effective January 2006.
A second and final set of additional e-prescribing transaction standards was published on April 2,
2008 and become effective on April 1, 2009. These standards are detailed and significant, and
cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also
electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information.
Our efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these regulations could be
time-consuming and expensive.

Claims Transmissions.

Certain of our solutions assist our clients in submitting claims to payers,
which claims are governed by federal and state laws. Our solutions are capable of electronically
transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients’ payers for
approval and reimbursement. Federal law provides



civil liability to any person that knowingly
submits a claim to a payer, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans, seeking payment
for any services or items that have not been provided to the patient. Federal law may also impose
criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. We have policies and procedures
in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete transmission of claims, provided that
the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete. The HIPAA security,
privacy and transaction standards, as discussed below, also have a potentially significant effect
on our claims transmission services, since those services must be structured and provided in a way
that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations.

Regulation of Medical Devices.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has
declared that certain of our solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“Act”) and amendments to the Act. Other countries have
similar regulations in place related to medical devices, that now or may in the future apply to
certain of our solutions. If other of our solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical
devices by the FDA or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we do business, we could be
subject to extensive requirements governing pre- and post-marketing requirements including
pre-market notification clearance. Complying with these medical device regulations on a global
perspective is time consuming and expensive. Further, it is possible that these regulatory
agencies may become more active in regulating software that is used in healthcare.

There have been nine FDA inspections at various Cerner sites since 1998. Inspections conducted at
our world headquarters in 1999 and our prior Houston, Texas facility in 2002 each resulted in the
issuance of an FDA Form 483 that we responded to promptly. The FDA has taken no further action
with respect to either of the Form 483s that were issued in 1999 and 2002. The remaining seven FDA
inspections, including inspections at our world headquarters in 2006 and 2007, resulted in no
issuance of a Form 483. We remain subject to periodic FDA inspections and we could be required to
undertake additional actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory
requirements. Our failure to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our
solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil
fines and/or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Security and Privacy of Patient Information.

State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality
of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released. These
regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information
and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures. Regulations
currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often
unclear and difficult to apply.

HIPAA regulations require national standards for some types of electronic health information
transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, security standards to ensure the
integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of
individually identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include
healthcare organizations such as our clients, our employer clinic business model and our claims
transmission services, were required to comply with the privacy standards by April 2003, the
transaction regulations by October 2003 and the security regulations by April 2005. As a business
associate of our clients who are covered entities, we, in most instances, must also ensure
compliance with the HIPAA regulations as it pertains to our clients.

Evolving HIPAA-related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our clients to obtain, use
or disseminate patient information. This could adversely affect demand for our solutions if they
are not re-designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new interpretations
or regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our clients
to execute new or modified healthcare transactions. We may need to expend additional capital,
software development and other resources to modify our solutions and devices to address these
evolving data security and privacy issues.



Interoperability Standards

. Our clients are concerned with and often require that our software
solutions and healthcare devices be interoperable with other third party HIT suppliers. Market
forces or governmental/regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that
would apply to our solutions, and if our software solutions and/or healthcare devices are not
consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development
costs to conform. The Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) has
developed a comprehensive set of criteria for the functionality, interoperability and security of
various software modules in the HIT industry. CCHIT, however, continues to modify and refine those
standards. Achieving CCHIT certification is becoming a competitive requirement, resulting in
increased software development and administrative expense to conform to these requirements. If our
software solutions and healthcare devices are not consistent with these evolving standards, our
market position and sales could be impaired and we may have to invest significantly in changes to
our software solutions and healthcare devices.

We operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries, and our ability to successfully compete
and continue to grow our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to market changes and
changing technologies and to bring competitive new solutions, devices, features and services to
market in a timely fashion.

The market for healthcare information systems, healthcare devices,
healthcare transactions and life sciences consulting services are intensely competitive,
dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological and innovative changes. Development of new
proprietary technology or services is complex, entails significant time and expense and may not be
successful. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to introduce new solutions, devices or
services on schedule, or at all, nor can we guarantee that errors will not be found in our new
solution releases, devices or services before or after commercial
release, which could result in solution, device or service delivery redevelopment costs and loss
of, or delay in, market acceptance.

Certain of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and
other resources than us and some of our competitors offer software solutions that we do not offer.
Our principal existing competitors are set forth above under Part I, Item 1 Competition.

In addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, large information
technology consulting service providers and system integrators, start-up companies and others
specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions, devices or
services. We face strong competitors and often face downward price pressure. Additionally, the
pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new
software solution introductions, software solution enhancements, device introductions, device
enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. There are a limited number of
hospitals and other healthcare providers in the U.S. HIT market. As costs fall, technology
improves, and market factors continue to compel investment by healthcare organizations in solutions
and services like ours, market saturation in the U.S. may change the competitive landscape in favor
of larger, more diversified competitors with greater scale.

Risks Related to Our Stock

The ongoing adverse financial market environment and uncertainty in global economic conditions
could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our operating
results may be impacted by the health of the global economy. Adverse economic conditions may cause
a slowdown or decline in client spending which could adversely affect our business and financial
performance. Our business and financial performance, including new business bookings and
collection of our accounts receivable, may be adversely affected by current and future economic
conditions (including a reduction in the availability of credit, higher energy costs, rising
interest rates, financial market volatility and recession) that cause a slowdown or decline in
client spending. Further, the ongoing global financial crisis may also limit our ability to access
the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an
impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if the
global financial crisis and current economic downturn continue or worsen, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.



Our quarterly operating results may vary which could adversely affect our stock price.

Our
quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods,
including, variations from guidance, expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly
operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes, demand for
our solutions, devices and services, the financial condition of our clients and potential clients,
our long sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycles for larger, more
complex and higher-priced systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this
report. As a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for our

Cerner Millennium

solutions, a large percentage of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger,
more complex and higher-priced systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and
involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the
client. Sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients’ internal budgets, procedures for
approving large capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, availability
of personnel resources and by actions taken by competitors. Delays in the expected sale,
installation or implementation of these large systems may have a significant impact on our
anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently our earnings, since a significant percentage of our
expenses are relatively fixed.

Revenue recognized in any quarter may depend upon our and our clients’ abilities to meet project
milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the project plan could
result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material
adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter.

Our revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and
greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of clients’ year-end efforts to
make all final capital expenditures for the then-current year.

Our sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter.

We use a “pipeline”
system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales
associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities, such as the date when they estimate that
a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale. These
estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. We compare this pipeline at
various points in time to evaluate trends in our business. This analysis provides guidance in
business planning and forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative.
Our pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter
or over a longer period of time, partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion
rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate. A negative variation
in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts, or in the pipeline
itself, could cause our plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business
results. For example, a slowdown in information technology spending, adverse economic conditions
or a variety of other factors can cause purchasing decisions to be delayed, reduced in amount or
cancelled, which would reduce the overall pipeline conversion rate in a particular period of time.
Because a substantial portion of our contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter, we
may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough in response to a revenue shortfall
resulting from a decrease in our pipeline conversion rate in any given fiscal quarter(s).

The trading price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market for our common stock may
experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including
actual or anticipated variations in operating results, rumors about our performance or solutions,
devices and services, changes in expectations of future financial performance or estimates of
securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client
relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a matter of policy, we do not generally comment
on our stock price or rumors.

Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the markets for software, healthcare and information
technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been
unrelated to the operating



performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual
operating performance.

Our Directors have authority to issue preferred stock and our corporate governance documents
contain anti-takeover provisions.

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights and privileges of
those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be
issued in the future.

In addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more
difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These
include provisions that: provide for a classified board of directors, prohibit shareholders from
taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of shareholders to call special meetings.
We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business
combination with any interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the person
became an interested shareholder, unless certain conditions are met, which could have the effect of
delaying or preventing a change of control.

Factors that May Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business

Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders of which this report is made a
part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
communications to shareholders, press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the
Company that are not historical in nature, or that state the Company’s or management’s intentions,
hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may constitute “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, such as “could,” “should,” “will,” “intended,” “continue,” “believe,”
“may,” “expect,” “hope,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “forecast,” “plan,” “guidance” or “estimate” or the
negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are
not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual results, financial
condition or business, could differ materially
from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to
such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors and
elsewhere herein or in other reports filed with the SEC. Other unforeseen factors not identified
herein could also have such an effect. We undertake no obligation to update or revise
forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events
or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time.

Item 2. Properties

World Headquarters

Our world headquarters offices are located in a Company-owned office park in North Kansas City,
Missouri, containing approximately 992,877 gross square feet of useable space (the “Campus”),
inclusive of the new data center and clinic buildings described below. As of January 3, 2009, we
were using all of the useable space for our U.S. corporate headquarters operations.

In June 2007, the Company completed construction of the world headquarters Technology Center, a
135,161 square foot data center facility on the Campus. We deliver remote hosting, disaster
recovery and other services to our clients from this facility.

In February 2006, we completed construction on the Campus of a 13,136 square foot addition to the
2901 Rockcreek Parkway building to house Health

e

Clinic, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which provides
primary care medical services for our associates and their family members.

In 2004, we purchased approximately 12 acres of unimproved real estate adjacent to the Campus for
campus expansion. This land was purchased to provide a secondary entry into the Campus and to
provide for future building development as needed. The first phase of development was a roadway
extension and second entry point



into the Campus. The second phase of development is the data
center facility described above. Future development of this land is undetermined at this time.

Other Properties

In February 2007, we entered into a long-term lease for 480,700 gross square feet of property
located in Kansas City, Missouri. This office space, known as the Innovation Campus, houses
associates from our intellectual property organizations. In April and August 2007, additional
space was added to this lease so that the Innovation Campus now consists of 791,940 square feet,
including the daycare facility listed below.

In July 2007, we entered into a lease for 36,800 gross square feet of property located in Kansas
City, Missouri, near the Innovation Campus, which is the home for our Innovation Kids Learning
Center, providing on-site daycare for Cerner associate families.

In June 2005, we purchased 263,512 gross square feet of property located in Kansas City, Missouri.
The office space, known as the Cerner Oaks Campus, houses associates from the

CernerWorks

group and
associates of Cerner’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health

(1)

Includes share-based compensation expense recognized in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. The impact of including this expense is a
$9.5 million decrease, net of $5.6 million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease
to diluted earnings per share of $.11 in 2008, a $10.2 million decrease, net of $6.0
million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of
$.12 in 2007 and a $11.7 million decrease, net of $7.3 million tax benefit, in net
earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of $.14 in 2006.

(2)

Includes expense related to a settlement with a third party
provider of software related to the use of the third party’s
software in the Company’s remote hosting business. The settlement
included compensation for the use of the software for periods prior
to 2008 as well as compensation for licenses of the software for
future use for existing and additional clients through January 2009.
Of the total settlement amount, the Company determined that
$5.0 million should have been recorded in prior periods,
primarily 2005 through 2007. Based on this valuation, 2008 results
include an increase of $8.0 million sales and client service
expense, a decrease of $5.0 million to net earnings, and a
decrease of $.06 to diluted earnings per share that are attributable
to prior periods.

(3)

Includes a research and development write-off related to the

RxStation

medication
dispensing devices. In connection with production and delivery of the

RxStation

medication dispensing devices, the Company reviewed the accounting treatment for the

RxStation

line of devices and determined that $8.6 million of research and development
activities for the

RxStation

medication dispensing devices that should have been
expensed was incorrectly capitalized. The impact of this charge is a $5.4 million
decrease, net of $3.2 million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted
earnings per share of $.06 in the year ended December 29, 2007. $2.1 million of this
$5.4 million after tax amount recorded in 2007 related to periods prior to 2007.

(4)

Includes a $3.1 million tax benefit recorded in 2007 related to periods prior to
2007. The tax benefit relates to the over-expensing of state income taxes, which
resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per share of $.04 in the year ended December
29, 2007.

(5)

Includes an adjustment to correct the amounts previously reported for the second
quarter of 2007 for a previously disclosed out-of-period tax item relating to foreign
net operating losses. The effect of this adjustment increases tax expense for the year
ended December 29, 2007, by $4.2 million and increases January 1, 2005 retained earnings
(Shareholders’ Equity) by the same amount.

(6)

Includes a tax benefit of $2.0 million for adjustments relating to prior periods.
This results in an increase to diluted earnings per share of $.02.



(7)

Includes a tax benefit of $4.8 million relating to the carry-back of a capital
loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated (“Zynx”) in the first quarter of
2004. The impact of this refund claim is a $4.8 million increase in net earnings and
an increase in diluted earnings per share of $.06 for 2005.

(8)

Includes a charge for the write-off of acquired in process research and
development related to the acquisition of the medical business division of VitalWorks,
Inc. The impact of this charge is a $3.9 million decrease, net of $2.4 million tax
benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of $.05 for 2005.

(9)

Includes a gain on the sale of Zynx. The impact of this gain is a $3.0 million
increase in net earnings and increase to diluted earnings per share of $.04 for 2004.

(10)

Includes a charge for vacation accrual of $3.3 million included in general and
administrative. The impact of this charge is a $2.1 million decrease, net of $1.2
million tax benefit, in net earnings and a decrease to diluted earnings per share of
$.03 for 2004.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand
the results of operations and financial condition of Cerner Corporation (“Cerner” or the
“Company”). This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our
financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”).

Management Overview

Cerner primarily derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions,
clinical content, hardware, healthcare devices and services that give healthcare providers secure
access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the
quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. We implement the healthcare
solutions as stand-alone, combined or enterprise-wide systems.

Cerner Millennium

®

software
solutions can be managed by the Company’s clients or in the Company’s data center via a managed
services model.

Cerner’s fundamental strategy centers on creating organic growth by investing in research and
development (R&D) to create solutions and services for the healthcare industry. This strategy has
driven strong growth over the long-term, as reflected in five- and ten-year compound annual revenue
growth rates of 15% or more. This growth has also created a very strategic client base of more
than 6,000 hospital, health system, physician practice, clinic, laboratory and pharmacy clients
around the world. Selling additional solutions back into this client base is an important element
of Cerner’s future revenue growth. We are also focused on driving growth through market share
expansion by replacing competitors in healthcare settings that are looking to replace their current
HIT partners or those who have not yet strategically aligned with a supplier. We also expect to
drive growth through new initiatives that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate such as our

CareAware

healthcare device architecture and devices,

Healthe

employer services,
physician practice solutions and solutions and services for the pharmaceutical market. Finally, we
expect continued strong revenue contributions from the sale of our solutions and services outside
of the U.S. Many non-U.S. markets have a low penetration of HIT solutions and their governing
bodies are in many cases focused on HIT as part of their strategy to improve the quality and lower
the cost of healthcare.

Beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth, Cerner is also focused on earnings growth. Similar
to our history of growing revenue, our net earnings have increased at more than 20%
compound annual rates over five- and ten-year periods. We believe we can continue driving strong
levels of earnings growth by continuing to grow revenue while also leveraging key areas to create
operating margin expansion. The primary areas of opportunity for margin expansion include:



•

becoming more efficient at implementing our software by leveraging implementation tools
and methodologies we have developed that can reduce the amount of effort required to
implement our software;

•

leveraging our investments in R&D by addressing new markets (i.e., non-U.S.) that do not
require significant incremental R&D but can contribute significantly to revenue growth;
and,

•

leveraging our scalable business infrastructure to reduce the rate of increase in
general and administrative spending to below our revenue growth rate.

We are also focused on increasing cash flow by growing earnings, reducing the use of working
capital and controlling capital expenditures. While 2007 was a year of heavy capital investment
because of investments in a new data center to support our rapidly growing hosting business and
purchasing new buildings to accommodate growth in our associate base, capital spending decreased in
2008 and we expect capital spending in 2009 to remain at levels below our 2007 spending.

Results Overview

In a challenging economic environment, we continued to execute on our core strategies to drive
revenue growth, expand operating margins, grow earnings and generate good cash flow in 2008. The
2008 results included strong levels of earnings, and cash flow and solid new business bookings.
New business bookings revenue in 2008, which reflects the value of executed contracts for software,
hardware, professional services and managed services (hosting of software in the Company’s data
center) was $1.54 billion, which is an increase of 2% when compared to $1.51 billion in 2007. The
2007 bookings exclude bookings related to the Company’s participation in the National Health
Services (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in England in
the amount of $97.8 million. Revenues for 2008 increased 10% to $1.68 billion compared to $1.52
billion in 2007, driven primarily by an increase in support, maintenance and services revenues.
2008 revenues and margin include a cumulative catch-up adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter,
in the amount of $28,640,000, resulting from a significant change in an accounting estimate related
to the Company’s contract in London as part of the NHS initiative to automate clinical processes
and digitize medical records in England.

The 2008 net earnings increased 48% to $188.7 million compared to $127.1 million in 2007. Diluted
earnings per share increased 48% to $2.26 compared to $1.53 in 2007. The 2008 and 2007 net
earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of accounting pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” which requires the expensing
of stock options. The effect of accounting under SFAS 123R reduced the 2008 net earnings and
diluted earnings per share by $9.5 million and $0.11, and the 2007 earnings and diluted earnings
per share by $10.2 million and $0.12, respectively. 2008 net earnings also include the catch-up of
margin adjustment related to the Company’s contract in London. The after tax effect of this catch
up increased 2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $20,600,000 and $0.24,
respectively. In addition to the benefit from the catch-up adjustment, the growth in net earnings
and diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by continued progress with the Company’s margin
expansion initiatives, particularly expanding the profitability of support and maintenance revenue,
leveraging R&D investments, and controlling sales, general, and administrative expenses. Our 2008
operating margin was 17%, and would have been 15% without the catch-up adjustment, compared to 13%
in 2007, and we remain on target to achieve our long term goal of 20% operating margins.

We had cash collections of receivables of $1.73 billion in 2008 compared to $1.65 billion in 2007,
with the increase driven by increased billings. Days sales outstanding increased to 92 days for
the quarter ended January 3, 2009 compared to 90 days for the quarter ended December 29, 2007.
Operating cash flows for 2008 were $281.8 million compared to $274.6 million in 2007.

This year also included progress on our strategic initiatives that, while not yet material to our
current results, are an important part of our longer-term growth strategy. For example, we had
several sales and implementations of our

CareAware MDBus™

healthcare device connectivity solution
that allows medical devices to be connected to an electronic medical record through a USB-like
connection. We also made progress with our employer-focused



initiatives, with our first health
center client, Cisco Systems, opening their LifeConnections Health Center in November 2008. This
is a fully-automated employee-based health center based on Cerner’s own successful on-campus model
that has led to improvements in quality, efficiency, and access to care for Cerner’s associates and
their dependents.

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December
31. Fiscal year 2008 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2007 and
2006 consisted of 52 weeks each.

Results of Operations

Year Ended January 3, 2009, Compared to Year Ended December 29, 2007

Revenues increased 10% to $1,676,028,000 in 2008, compared with $1,519,877,000 in 2007. The
revenue composition for 2008 was $522,373,000 in system sales, $472,579,000 in support and
maintenance, $643,317,000 in services and $37,759,000 in reimbursed travel. The Company’s net
earnings increased 48% to $188,658,000 in 2008 from $127,125,000 in 2007. The effects of SFAS No.
123R, which requires the expensing of stock options, decreased net earnings in 2008 and 2007 by
$9,503,000, net of $5,641,000 tax benefit and $10,159,000, net of $6,030,000 tax benefit,
respectively.

As discussed in the results overview and more fully described in the Operations by Segment, 2008
revenues and margin included a cumulative catch-up adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter, in
the amount of $28,640,000, resulting from a significant change in accounting estimate related to
the Company’s contract in London. The majority of the catch-up adjustment revenue was included in
support, maintenance and services.

•

System sales revenues increased 4% to $522,373,000 in 2008 from $500,319,000 in 2007.
Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware, sublicensed
software, deployment period licensed software upgrade rights, installation fees,
transaction processing and subscriptions. The increase in system sales was driven by
growth in licensed software, sublicensed software, and subscriptions.

•

Support, maintenance and services revenues increased 14% to $1,115,896,000 in 2008 from
$982,780,000 in 2007. Included in support, maintenance and services revenues are support
and maintenance of software and hardware, professional services excluding installation, and
managed services. A summary of the Company’s support, maintenance and services revenues in
2008 and 2007 is as follows:

applications, implementing them at client sites, and initiating billing for support and
maintenance fees.

•

Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized
as revenue, increased 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase was driven by growth in
new business bookings during the past four quarters, including continued strong levels of
managed services bookings that typically have longer contract terms. In the second quarter
of 2008, contract backlog was reduced by



approximately $178,000,000 as a result of the
contract withdrawal by the prime contractor in the southern region of England. A summary
of the Company’s total backlog for 2008 and 2007 follows:

The cost of revenues was 18% of total revenues in both 2008 and 2007. The cost of revenues
includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, sales commissions, third party consulting services
and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from hardware and
software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance
and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Such costs, as a percent of
revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, maintenance, support,
services and reimbursed travel) carrying different margin rates changes from period to period.
Costs of revenues does not include the costs of our client service personnel who are responsible
for delivering our service offerings, such costs are included in sales and client service expense.

Total operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues, increased 6% to $1,101,080,000 in 2008 from
$1,035,684,000 in 2007. Accounting pursuant to SFAS 123(R), which results in the expensing of
share-based compensation, impacted expenses in 2008 and 2007 as indicated below:

and 2007. These expenses increased 9% to $715,512,000 in 2008, from $657,956,000 in 2007.
Sales and client service expenses include salaries of sales and client service personnel,
depreciation and other expenses associated with our

CernerWorks

managed service business,
communications expenses, unreimbursed travel expenses, expense for share-based payments,
sales and marketing salaries and trade show and advertising costs. The increase was
primarily attributable to growth in the managed services business, including $8,014,000 of
expense recorded in the second quarter of 2008 for a settlement with a third party provider
of software related to the use of the third party’s software in this business.

•

Total expense for software development in 2008 increased 1% to $272,519,000, from
$270,576,000 in 2007. Expenditures for software development in 2008 reflect continued
development and enhancement of the

Cerner Millennium

platform and software solutions and
investments in new initiatives, such as

RxStation

medication dispensing devices. Included
in 2007 software development expense is $8.6 million of research and development activities
for the

RxStation

medical dispensing device. $3.4 million of this amount recorded in 2007
is related to periods prior to 2007. A summary of the Company’s total software development

General and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in 2008 and
2007. These expenses increased 6% to $113,049,000 in 2008 from $107,152,000 in 2007. This
increase was due primarily to the growth of the Company’s core business and increased
presence in the global market. General and administrative expenses include salaries for
corporate, financial and administrative staff, utilities, communications expenses,
professional fees, the transaction gains or losses on foreign currency and expense for
share-based payments. The Company recorded a net transaction gain on foreign currency of
$9,858,000 and $3,691,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Net interest income was $3,056,000 in 2008, compared with net interest income of $1,269,000 in
2007. Interest income increased to $13,604,000 in 2008 from $13,206,000 in 2007, due primarily to
higher returns received from our investments in auction rate securities. Interest expense
decreased to $10,548,000 in 2008 from $11,937,000 in 2007, due primarily to a reduction in
long-term debt.

Other
expense was $510,000 in 2008, compared to other expense of $1,385,000 in 2007. As a result of the Company entering into a settlement agreement with an investment firm relating to
auction rate securities, Other expense in 2008 includes the recognition of a gain of $19,860,000
for a put-like feature. This gain was offset by the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment loss recorded on the Company’s auction rate securities due to a reclassification of
these securities from available-for-sale to trading.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 33% and 38% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. This decrease is
primarily due to a higher than normal rate in 2007. The increase in the effective rate in 2007 was
primarily due to recognition of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2007 on certain of
the Company’s foreign tax loss carryforwards. Such additional tax expense in 2007 was partially
offset by a tax benefit for adjustments relating to prior periods. The tax rate for 2008 was
slightly lower than normal due to strong income levels from global regions that have lower tax
rates.

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company determined that due to a change in circumstances in
the quarter, it is more likely than not that certain tax operating loss carry-forwards in a
non-U.S. jurisdiction would not be realized resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance
totaling approximately $7,982,000. The 2007 valuation allowance was used in 2008 to offset a
reduction in the operating loss carry-forward for the non-U.S. jurisdiction.

Tax expense for 2007 and 2008 include benefits of approximately $3,125,000 and $2,879,000,
respectively, for corrections relating to prior periods.

Domestic Segment

The Company’s Domestic segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures associated with
business activity in the United States.

Operating earnings increased 7% to $720,342,000 in 2008 from $675,156,000 in 2007.

•

Revenues increased 7% to $1,307,510,000 in 2008 from $1,227,434,000 in 2007. This
increase was primarily driven by growth in managed services and support and maintenance.

•

Cost of revenues was 17% and 18% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline was driven
primarily by a lower level of hardware sales.

•

Operating expenses increased 9% for 2008, compared to 2007, due primarily to growth in
managed services.

Global Segment

The Company’s Global segment in 2008 and 2007 includes revenue contributions and expenditures
linked to business activity in Aruba, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile,
China (Hong Kong), Egypt, England, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

Operating earnings increased 72% to $147,681,000 in 2008 from $85,955,000 in 2007.

Revenues increased 27% to $368,518,000 in 2008 from $290,677,000 in 2007. This increase was
primarily driven by an increase in sales in Europe and the Middle East. Global revenue
includes work related to the Company’s participation in the NHS initiative to automate
clinical processes and digitize medical records in England. Prior to 2008, the revenues
related to this effort were accounted for using a zero margin approach of applying
percentage of completion accounting resulting from the Company’s inability to



accurately
estimate the work effort required to complete the project as well as the determination of
fair value for the support services and other elements which would not be accounted for in
accordance with the percentage of completion accounting methodology. London is one of two
regions in England in which the Company is participating. As it relates to the London
arrangement, during 2008 the Company established fair value of the undelivered elements of
the arrangement that are not subject to percentage of completion accounting. Also, during
the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company realized a significant milestone in London which
significantly enhances the Company’s ability to make reliable estimates of the work effort
for the remainder of the contract. These events, combined with our experience since the
contract signed in 2006 and our experience in the Southern region of England, allowed the
Company to conclude that reasonably dependable estimates of work effort could be produced
and allow for margin recognition. As a result, the Company’s fourth quarter 2008 revenues
included a cumulative catch-up adjustment, resulting from the significant change in
accounting estimate, in the amount of $28,640,000 which represents the margin on the
contract which had been previously deferred as a result of the zero margin approach of
applying percentage of completion accounting. The remaining margin attributed to the
services subject to SOP 81-1 will be recognized over the remaining service period until the
services are complete and amounts allocated to the other support services subject to SOP
97-2 will be recognized over the relevant support periods. The contract expires in 2014.

The other region in England the Company is participating in is the Southern region. During
the second quarter of 2008, the contract with Fujitsu, the prime contractor in the Southern
region of England, was terminated which had the effect of automatically terminating the
Company’s subcontract for the project. A transition services agreement was signed during
the third quarter of 2008 that provides for ongoing services for the Trusts that already
have live systems for which margin was recognized. No formal timeline has been set for
addressing the implementations at the remaining Trusts, but the Company currently expects to
play an ongoing role in this region. Margin recognized in 2008 was not significant.

•

Cost of revenues was 19% and 18% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher cost of
revenues was driven by a higher mix of hardware revenues in 2008.

•

Operating expenses for the year ended January 3, 2009 decreased less than 1%, compared
to the year ended December 29, 2007.

Other Segment

The Company’s Other segment includes revenues and expenses which are not tracked by geographic
segment. Operating losses increased 6% to $589,138,000 in 2008 from $557,028,000 in 2007. This
increase was primarily due to increased research and development and general and administrative
spending and a settlement with a third party supplier in the second quarter of 2008 related to the
prior period usage of their software in the Company’s remote hosting business. The third party
supplier settlement increased Other segment expense by $8,014,000 in the second quarter of 2008.

Year Ended December 29, 2007, Compared to Year Ended December 30, 2006

The Company’s net earnings increased 16% to $127,125,000 in 2007 from $109,891,000 in 2006. The
effects of SFAS No. 123R, which requires the expensing of stock options, decreased net earnings in
2007 and 2006 by $10,159,000, net of $6,030,000 tax benefit and $11,746,000, net of $7,275,000 tax
benefit, respectively.

Revenues increased 10% to $1,519,877,000 in 2007, compared with $1,378,038,000 in 2006. The
revenue composition for 2007 was $500,319,000 in system sales, $397,713,000 in support and
maintenance, $585,067,000 in services and $36,778,000 in reimbursed travel.

•

System sales revenues decreased 1% to $500,319,000 in 2007 from $505,743,000 in 2006.
Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware, sublicensed
software, deployment period



licensed software upgrade rights, installation fees,
transaction processing and subscriptions. The slight decrease in system sales was
primarily attributable to a decrease in software revenue, which was largely offset by an
increase in hardware, sublicensed software, and subscriptions revenue. We believe the
decline in software revenue was primarily caused by much of our client base being focused
on upgrading to the

Cerner Millennium

2007 release. Cerner generally sells a perpetual
license, so our clients do not have to pay new license fees when they upgrade to a new
version of our software, so the focus by much of our base on implementing the upgrade
impacted our software sales.

•

Support, maintenance and services revenues increased 18% to $982,780,000 in 2007 from
$833,244,000 in 2006. Included in support, maintenance and services revenues are support
and maintenance of software and hardware, professional services excluding installation, and
managed services. A summary of the Company’s support, maintenance and services revenues in
2007 and 2006 is as follows:

•

Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized
as revenue, increased 24% in 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by growth in
new business bookings during the past four quarters, including continued strong levels of
managed services bookings that typically have longer contract terms. A summary of the
Company’s total backlog for 2007 and 2006 follows:

The cost of revenues was 18% of total revenues in 2007 and 21% in 2006. The cost of revenues
includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, sales commissions, third party consulting services
and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from hardware and
software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance
and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Such costs, as a percent of
revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, maintenance, support,
services and reimbursed travel) carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The
decline in cost of revenues as a percent of revenue was primarily associated with lower commissions
and third party costs on licensed software sales and a higher mix of support, maintenance and
services revenues, which have a lower cost of revenue.

Total operating expenses, excluding cost of revenues, increased 12% to $1,035,684,000 in 2007 from
$920,901,000 in 2006. Accounting pursuant to SFAS 123(R), which results in the expensing of

$578,050,000 in 2006. Sales and client service expenses include salaries of sales and
client service personnel, communications expenses, unreimbursed travel expenses, expense for
share-based payments, sales and marketing salaries and trade show and advertising costs. The
increase was primarily attributable to growth in

CernerWorks

managed services business.

•

Total expense for software development in 2007 increased 10% to $270,576,000, from
$246,970,000 in 2006. The increase in aggregate expenditures for software development in
2007 was due to continued development and enhancement of the

Cerner Millennium

platform and
software solutions and investments in new initiatives, such as

RxStation

medication
dispensing devices. Included in 2007 software development expense is $8.6 million of
research and development activities for the

RxStation

medical dispensing device. $3.4
million of this amount recorded in 2007 is related to periods prior to 2007. A summary of
the Company’s total software development expense in 2007 and 2006 is as follows:

General and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in 2007 and
2006. These expenses increased 12% to $107,152,000 in 2007 from $95,881,000 in 2006. This
increase was due primarily to the growth of the Company’s core business and increased
presence in the global market. General and administrative expenses include salaries for
corporate, financial and administrative staff, utilities, communications expenses,
professional fees, the transaction gains or losses on foreign currency and expense for
share-based payments. The Company recorded a net transaction gain on foreign currency of
$3,691,000 and $3,764,000 in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net interest income was $1,269,000 in 2007, compared with net interest expense of $697,000 in 2006.
Interest income increased to $13,206,000 in 2007 from $11,877,000 in 2006, due primarily to higher
yields on cash and short term investments. Interest expense decreased to $11,937,000 in 2007 from
$12,574,000 in 2006, due primarily to a reduction in long-term debt.

Other expense was $1,385,000 in 2007, compared to other income of $2,074,000 in 2006. Included in
2006 other income is a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2006 related to the renegotiation of a
supplier contract that eliminated a liability related to unfavorable future commitments due to that
supplier. The Company was able to renegotiate the contract to eliminate certain minimum volume
requirements and reduce pricing to market rates leading to the elimination of the previously
recorded liability.

The Company’s effective tax rate was 38% and 34% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in tax
rate was principally related to the creation of a valuation allowance in a non-U.S. jurisdiction in
2007.



During the second quarter of 2007, the Company determined that due to a change in circumstances in
the quarter, it is more likely than not that certain tax operating loss carry-
forwards in a non-U.S. jurisdiction would not be realized resulting in the recognition of a
valuation allowance totaling approximately $7,982,000.

Tax expense for 2007 and 2006 includes benefits of approximately $3,125,000 and $1,994,000,
respectively for adjustments to correct certain tax items relating to prior periods.

Domestic Segment

The Company’s Domestic segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures associated with
business activity in the United States.

Operating earnings increased 11% to $675,156,000 in 2007 from $607,003,000 in 2006.

•

Revenues increased 5% to $1,227,434,000 in 2007 from $1,166,662,000 in 2006. This
increase was primarily driven by growth in managed services and support and maintenance.

•

Cost of revenues was 18% and 22% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decline was driven
primarily by lower commissions and third party costs on licensed software sales, lower
hardware sales, and a higher mix of support, maintenance and services revenues, which have
a lower cost of revenue.



•

Operating expenses increased 7% for the year ended December 29, 2007, as compared to the
year ended December 30, 2006, due primarily to growth in managed services.

Global Segment

The Company’s Global segment in 2007 and 2006 includes revenue contributions and expenditures
linked to business activity in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, China (Hong
Kong), Egypt, England, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

Operating earnings increased 42% to $85,955,000 in 2007 from $60,572,000 in 2006.

•

Revenues increased 40% to $290,677,000 in 2007 from $207,367,000 in 2006. Approximately
one third of this increase was driven by an increase in revenue from the Company’s
participation in the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical
processes and digitize medical records in England. The increase in global revenue was also
driven by growth in several other countries, including Malaysia, Australia, Egypt, France,
Spain and the United Arab Emirates. Revenue related to the NHS initiative that was being
accounted for at zero margin totaled $96,000,000 and $71,000,000 for the 2007 and 2006
fiscal years, respectively. These revenues did not affect operating earnings as the
Company was accounting for them at zero-margin using a zero margin approach of applying
percentage of completion accounting until either the software customization and development
services are completed or the Company is able to determine fair value for the support
services.

•

Cost of revenues was 18% and 19% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The lower cost of
revenues was driven by a slightly higher mix of support, maintenance and services revenues,
which have a lower cost of revenue.

•

Operating expenses for the year ended December 29, 2007 increased 41%, compared to the
year ended December 30, 2006, primarily due to hiring personnel for the projects in England
and supporting growth in other global regions.

Other Segment

The Company’s Other segment includes revenues and expenses which are not tracked by geographic
segment. Operating losses increased 11% to $557,028,000 in 2007 from $501,408,000 in 2006. This
increase was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses such as software development,
marketing, general and administrative, share-based compensation expense and depreciation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the
Company’s revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in
software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is its cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of money market
funds. At January 3, 2009 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $270,494,000, short-term
investments of $38,400,000 and working capital of $517,650,000 compared to cash and cash
equivalents of $182,914,000, short-term investments of $161,600,000 and working capital of
$530,441,000 at December 29, 2007.

At January 3, 2009, more than 10 percent of total net receivables represent accounts receivable and
contracts receivable related to a contract with Fujitsu that was terminated in the second quarter
of 2008 when Fujitsu withdrew from the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate
clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern region of England. The Company
expects to collect these receivables in full based on the terms of the contract.



At January 3, 2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a par value of $105,300,000 and
an estimated fair value of $85,440,000. In February and March 2008, liquidity issues in the global
credit markets resulted in the progressive failure of auctions representing all the auction rate
securities held by Cerner. These conditions persisted through the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.
In November 2008, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the investment firm that
sold the Company its auction rate securities. Under the terms of the settlement agreement the
Company received the right to redeem the securities at par value during a period from mid-2010
through mid-2012. The right to redeem the securities is being treated similar to a put option,
which the Company has elected to measure under the fair value option of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS No. 159), “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities"

. The Company’s valuation model resulted in a pre-tax, estimated value of
$19,860,000 for the value of the put-like settlement feature, which such gain was recognized
through other income.

Concurrently with the recognition of the put-like feature, the Company transferred the auction rate
securities from available-for-sale to trading securities. As a result of the transfer, the Company
recognized a pre-tax, other than temporary impairment loss of approximately $19,860,000 in other
income. The recording of the put-like feature and the recognition of the other than temporary
impairment loss on the securities resulted in no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operating
Earnings for the year ended January 3, 2009. The Company anticipates that any future changes in
the fair value of the put-like feature will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the
related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. For a more detailed discussion of the auction rate securities situation, please refer to
Note (7) to the consolidated financial statements. Cerner does not expect the auction failures to
impact the Company’s ability to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures or other
business requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The Company generated cash of $281,802,000, $274,565,000, and $232,718,000 from operations in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2008 due primarily to the
increase in net earnings which was partially offset by changes in working capital. The Company has
periodically provided long-term financing options to creditworthy clients through third party
financing institutions and has directly provided extended payment terms to clients from contract
date. These extended payment term arrangements typically provide for date based payments over
periods ranging from 12 months to seven years. Pursuant to SOP 97-2, because a significant portion
of the fee is due beyond one year, we have analyzed our history with these types of arrangements
and have concluded that we do have a standard business practice of using extended payment term
arrangements and have a long history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms
for arrangements with similar clients, product offerings and economics without granting
concessions. Accordingly, we consider the fee to be fixed and determinable in these extended
payment term arrangements and, thus, the timing of revenue is not impacted by the existence of
extended payments. Some of these payment streams have been assigned on a non-recourse basis to
third party financing institutions. The Company has provided its usual and customary performance
guarantees to the third party financing institutions in connection with its on-going obligations
under the client contract. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company received total client cash
collections of $1,729,526,000, $1,646,584,000, and $1,457,603,000, respectively, of which
approximately 5%, 5%, and 7% were
received from third party client financing arrangements and non-recourse payment assignments,
respectively. The days sales outstanding increased to 92 days for the quarter ended January 3,
2009 compared to 90 days for the quarter ended December 29, 2007. Revenues provided under support
and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues
increased 19% in 2008 and 17% in 2007, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow
as the base of installed

Cerner Millennium

systems grows.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities in 2008 consisted primarily of capital purchases of $108,099,000,
which includes $89,904,000 of capital equipment and $18,195,000 of land, buildings and
improvements. Capitalized software development costs were $70,098,000 in 2008. Payments
aggregating $5,719,000 were made during 2008 for an



acquisition of a business and an earnout
payment related to a 2005 acquisition. Cash received from short-term investments, net of purchases
was $17,510,000 in 2008. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 consisted primarily of capital
purchases of $180,723,000, which includes $105,678,000 of capital equipment and $75,045,000 of
land, buildings and improvements. Capitalized software development costs were $66,063,000 and the
acquisition of businesses totaled $24,061,000. Cash paid for short-term investments, net of sales
and maturities, was $13,277,000 in 2007.

In the second quarter of 2007, the Company completed the construction of a new data center on its
World Headquarters campus in North Kansas City, Missouri. The Company spent approximately
$61,203,000 on this construction project. Of this amount, approximately $26,858,000 was spent in
2007, with the remainder being spent in prior years.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The Company’s 2008 financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of options of
$15,364,000, the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $9,166,000, net repayment of
long-term debt of $15,317,000, sales of future receivables of $7,135,000, and purchases of treasury
stock of $28,002,000. In 2007, the Company’s financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds
from the exercise of options of $29,085,000, the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation
of $30,357,000 and repayment of long-term debt of $22,359,000.

In December 2008, the Company had a same-day borrowing of $44,500,000 from its line of credit which
was repaid that same day. This was in connection with tax incentives related to the World
Headquarters data center and the Innovation Campus. In December 2007, the Company had a one-day
borrowing of $40,000,000 from its line of credit which was repaid on the following day. This was
in connection with tax incentives related to the World Headquarters data center.

In November 2005, the Company completed a £65,000,000 ($94,556,000 at January 3, 2009) private
placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven
equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2009.

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57% were paid in
full by the end of 2008. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%,
are payable in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The
proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for
general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge
coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur
liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January
3, 2009.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on
November 30, 2006, and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital
purposes. The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of
interest only. Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (3.25% at
January 3, 2009) or LIBOR (1.41% at January 3, 2009) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be reduced
by up to 1.15% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net
worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the
Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of .2%
is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of
credit matures on May 31, 2010. At January 3, 2009, the Company had no outstanding borrowings
under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was
in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2009.



In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, were paid in
full by the end of 2006. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%,
are payable in six equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used
to retire the Company’s then-existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for
capital improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The Note Agreement contains
certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2009.

The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations,
short-term investments and, if necessary, its lines of credit, will be sufficient to meet
anticipated cash requirements during 2009.

The following table represents a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial
commitments, excluding interest, as of January 3, 2009, except short-term purchase order
commitments arising in the ordinary course of business.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement establishes a
single authoritative definition of fair value when accounting rules require the use of fair value,
sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value
measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2. This
FSP defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities within the scope of the FSP. The Company adopted SFAS 157 for
fair value measurement outside of the scope of FSP No. 157-2 on December 30, 2007. On October 10,
2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3 that clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that
is not active. FSP No. 157-3 is effective for all periods presented in accordance with SFAS 157
and the Company has considered the guidance with respect to the valuation of its financial assets
and their designation within the fair value hierarchy. The Company was required to fully adopt
SFAS 157 as of the first day of the 2009 fiscal year and does not expect its adoption to have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised
2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)) which replaces SFAS 141 and supersedes FIN 4,
“Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method”. SFAS 141(R) establishes guidelines for how an acquirer measures and recognizes the
identifiable assets, goodwill, noncontrolling interest, and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Additionally, SFAS 141(R) outlines the disclosures necessary to allow financial
statement users to assess the impact of the acquisition. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of adoption of SFAS 141(R), which will depend on future acquisition activity, and will be
required to adopt SFAS 141(R) prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after the
first day of the 2009 fiscal year.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (SFAS
160), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”, which amends ARB No. 51.
SFAS 160 guides that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the
consolidated financial statements, and that net income should be reported at amounts that include
the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 160 on its results of operations, which is
expected to be immaterial, and its financial position and was required to adopt SFAS 160 as of the
first day of the 2009 fiscal year.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 161 (SFAS 161), “Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”.
SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about the uses of derivative instruments and hedging
activities, how these activities are accounted for, and their respective impact on an entity’s
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of adoption of SFAS 161 on its results of operations and its financial position, which is
expected to be immaterial, and was required to adopt SFAS 161 as of the first day of the 2009
fiscal year.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding
the Company’s historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of
revenue and other significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. These
significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, potential
impairments of goodwill and income taxes. These policies and the Company’s procedures related to
these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this “Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.” In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon
discussion of the Company’s accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software-related
services, using the residual method under SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by
SOP No. 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) 104 “Revenue Recognition”
and Emerging Issues Task Force



00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). Key factors in the Company’s revenue recognition model are
management’s assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the
Company’s software whereas implementation services are not; and the length of time it takes for the
Company to achieve its delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software. If the
Company’s business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be
essential to the functionality of the Company’s software, the period of time over which the
Company’s licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally
recognizes combined revenue from the sale of its licensed software and related installation
services over two key milestones, delivery and installation, based on percentages that reflect the
underlying effort from planning to installation. Generally, both milestones are achieved in the
quarter the contracts are executed. If the period of time to achieve the Company’s delivery and
installation milestones for its licensed software were to lengthen, its milestones would be
adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change.

The Company also recognizes revenue for certain projects using the percentage of completion method
pursuant to Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1), Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type
and Certain Production-Type Contracts

,

as prescribed by SOP 97-2. The Company’s revenue
recognition is dependent upon the Company’s ability to reliably estimate the direct labor hours to
complete a project which in some cases can span several years. The Company utilizes its historical
project experience and detailed planning process as a basis for its future estimates to complete
current projects. Significant delays in completion of the projects, unforeseen cost increases or
penalties could result in significant reductions to revenue and margins on these contracts.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those
solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design, which is when the Company
determines that technological feasibility has been established. Thereafter, all software
development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are
available for general release, and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of
amortized cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross
future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing
and disposing of that product. Because the development of projected net future revenues related to
our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates, a
significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software
development costs. We historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the
net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference between the net realizable value
and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years. We expect that trend to continue in
the future. If we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to 10%, the amount of our
capitalized software development costs would not be impaired. Capitalized costs are amortized
based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual
amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the
software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The five-year
period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon
the Company’s forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs. Historically, use of
the Company’s software
programs by its clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more.

The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology
consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare
industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the HIT market is rapid
and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry
standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less
valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment.

Fair Value Measurements

On December 30, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
except for portions related to the non-financial assets and liabilities within the scope of the
deferral provided by FSP No. FAS 157-2. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by
SFAS No. 157 are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities.

•

Level 3 — Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

At January 3, 2009, the Company held investments in commercial paper along with auction rate
securities. Commercial paper consists of short-term corporate debt with maturities of less than
three months. All of the commercial paper held at January 3, 2009 was rated P1/A1 or higher.
Auction rate securities are debt instruments with long-term nominal maturities, for which the
interest rates regularly reset every 7-35 days under an auction system. Due to the lack of
availability of observable market quotes on the Company’s investment portfolio of auction rate
securities, the Company utilizes valuation models including those that are based on discounted cash
flow streams, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the
security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. The valuation is subject to
uncertainties that are difficult to predict.

A considerable amount of judgment and estimation is applied in the valuation of auction rate
securities. In addition, the Company also applies judgment in determining whether the marketable
securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically considers the severity and
duration of the decline, future prospects of the issuer and the Company’s ability and intent to
hold the security to recovery.

Goodwill

The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually
or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where
it is subject to an annual impairment test based on fair value. The Company assesses goodwill for
impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and evaluates impairment



indicators at each quarter end. The Company assessed its goodwill for impairment in the
second quarters of 2008 and 2007 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired. The Company used a
discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods.
Goodwill amounted to $146,666,000 and $143,924,000 at January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007,
respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Company’s reporting units that recognized
goodwill do not materialize as expected the Company’s goodwill could be impaired, which could
result in significant write-offs.

Income Taxes

In 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in an enterprise’s tax return. Management makes a number
of assumptions and estimates in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income
taxes. These assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdiction in which the Company
operates as well as current tax regulations. Accruals are established for estimates of tax effects
for certain transactions, business structures and future projected profitability of the Company’s
businesses based on management’s interpretation of existing facts and circumstances. If these
assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances
the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial
statements. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective at the beginning of 2007. The adoption of FIN 48
did not have a material impact on Cerner’s consolidated financial position. See Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to FIN 48.

Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
Company’s disclosure contained herein.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

At January 3, 2009, the Company had a £65,000,000 ($94,556,000 at January 3, 2009) note payable
outstanding through a private placement with an interest rate of 5.54%. The note is payable in
seven equal installments beginning in November 2009. Because the borrowing is denominated in
pounds, the Company is exposed to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S.
dollar and the Great Britain pound. The note was entered into for other than trading purposes.
Beginning in 2006, at the beginning of each quarterly period, the Company designated a portion
(between £60 million and £63 million during the year) of its debt (£65 million) that is denominated
in Great Britain Pounds, to hedge its net investment in a subsidiary in England. During 2007 and
2008 the Company designated all £65 million of its debt that is denominated in Great Britain
Pounds.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

N/A

Item 9.A. Controls and Procedures

a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by the Annual Report (the
“Evaluation Date”). They have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information



relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by
others within those entities and would be disclosed on a timely basis. The CEO and CFO have
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are
effective, to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. They have
also concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the
CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

b)

There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
during the three months ended January 3, 2009, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.

c)

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and are effective at that reasonable assurance level. However, the Company’s
management can provide no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal control over financial reporting can prevent all errors and all fraud under all
circumstances. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
the Company have been or will be detected. The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended). The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of January 3, 2009. In making this assessment, the Company’s
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company’s management has
concluded that, as of January 3, 2009, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on these criteria. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
that audited the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report has issued an
audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which
is included herein under “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cerner Corporation as of January 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Cerner Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing in
Item 9.A. Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cerner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cerner Corporation and subsidiaries
(the Corporation) as of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of
operating earnings, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended
January 3, 2009. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material
respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007,
and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
January 3,
2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3,
2009,
based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over
financial
reporting.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cerner Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Nature of Operations

- The Company designs, develops, markets, installs, hosts and supports
software information technology, healthcare devices and content solutions for healthcare
organizations and consumers. The Company also provides a wide range of value-added services,
including implementing solutions as individual, combined or enterprise-wide systems; hosting
solutions in its data center; and clinical process optimization services. Furthermore, the Company
provides fully-automated on-site employer health clinics and third party administrator health plan
services for employers.

(c)

Revenue Recognition

- Revenues are derived primarily from the licensing of clinical, financial
and administrative information systems and solutions. The components of the system sales revenues
are the licensing of computer software, deployment period upgrades, installation, content
subscriptions, transaction processing and the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed software.
The components of support, maintenance and service revenues are software support and hardware
maintenance, remote hosting and managed services, training, consulting and implementation services.
For arrangements that include both product and services which are accounted for under SOP 81-1 and
also include support services (PCS) for which vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
(VSOE) of PCS does not exist such that a zero margin approach is used to recognize revenue, the
Company classifies revenue under such arrangements as either systems sales or support, maintenance
and services based on the nature of costs incurred. For similar arrangements for which VSOE of PCS
exists, PCS is separated from the arrangement based on VSOE and the residual amount is allocated to
the software and services accounted for on a combined basis under SOP 81-1. For these
arrangements, the service component of the SOP 81-1 deliverable is
classified as service revenue based on
the VSOE of the services as if provided on a stand-alone basis and the residual is classified as
systems sales revenue. For the years ended January 3, 2009, December 29, 2007 and December 30,
2006, approximately $26,700,000, $20,000,000 and $16,000,000, respectively, of revenue were
included in system sales and approximately $86,600,000, $95,000,000, and $55,000,000, respectively,
of revenue were included in support, maintenance, and services for such arrangements. The Company
provides several models for the procurement of its clinical, financial and administrative
information systems. The predominant method is a perpetual software license agreement,
project-related installation services, implementation and consulting services, software support and
either remote hosting services or computer hardware and sublicensed software.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP)
97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-4, SOP 98-9 and clarified by Staff
Accounting Bulletin’s (SAB) No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). SOP 97-2,
as amended, generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple-elements
to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if fair values
exist for all elements of the arrangement. Pursuant to SOP 98-9, the Company recognizes revenue
from multiple-element software arrangements using the residual method. Under the residual method,
revenue is recognized in a multiple-element arrangement when Company-specific objective evidence of
fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. professional
services, software support, hardware maintenance, remote hosting services, hardware and sublicensed
software), but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement (i.e.
software solutions including project-related installation services). The Company allocates revenue
to each undelivered element in a multiple-element arrangement based on the element’s respective
fair value, with
the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately. Specifically,
the Company determines the fair value of the software support and maintenance, hardware and
sublicensed software support, remote hosting and subscriptions portions of the arrangement based on
the substantive renewal price for these services charged to clients; professional services
(including training and consulting) portion of the arrangement, other than installation services,
based on hourly rates which the Company charges for these services when sold apart from a software
license; and, the hardware and sublicensed software, based on the prices for these elements when
they are sold separately from



the software. The residual amount of the fee after allocating
revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements is attributed to the software solution,
including project-related installation services. If evidence of the fair value cannot be
established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement, the entire amount of revenue under
the arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be
established.

The Company provides project-related installation services, which include project-scoping services,
conducting pre-installation audits and creating initial environments. Because installation
services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software, the Company recognizes
the software license and installation services fees over the software installation period using the
percentage of completion method pursuant to Statement of Position 81-1 (SOP 81-1),

Accounting for
Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts,

as prescribed by SOP 97-2.
The Company measures the percentage of completion based on output measures which reflect direct
labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at completion of installation.
The installation services process length is dependent upon client specific factors and generally
occurs in the same period the contracts are executed but can extend up to one year.

The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include consulting
activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services. These services
vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may
include additional database consulting, system configuration, project management, testing
assistance, network consulting, post conversion review and application management services.
Implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed to be essential to the
functionality of the software, and thus do not impact the timing of the software license
recognition, unless software license fees are tied to implementation milestones. In those
instances, the portion of the software license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred
until the related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non-forfeitable.
Implementation fees are recognized over the service period, which may extend from nine months to
three years for multi-phased projects.

Remote hosting and managed services are marketed under long-term arrangements generally over
periods of five to 10 years. These services are typically provided to clients that have acquired a
perpetual license for licensed software and have contracted with the Company to host the software
in its data center. Under these arrangements, the client generally has the contractual right to
take possession of the licensed software at any time during the hosting period without significant
penalty and it is feasible for the client to either run the software on its own equipment or
contract with another party unrelated to the Company to host the software. These services are not
deemed to be essential to the functionality of the licensed software or other elements of the
arrangement and as such, the Company accounts for these arrangements under SOP 97-2, as prescribed
by EITF Issue No. 00-3, “

Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That
Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity’s Hardware"

. For those arrangements
where the client does not have the contractual right or the ability to take possession of the
software at any time, the Company accounts for the arrangement as a service contract and thereby
recognizes revenues for the arrangement over the hosting service period. The hosting and managed
services are recognized as the services are performed.

The Company also offers its solutions on an application service provider (“ASP”) model, making
available time based licenses for the Company’s software functionality and providing the software
solutions on a remote processing basis from the Company’s data centers. The data centers provide
system and administrative support as well as processing services. Revenue on software and services
provided on an ASP or term license basis is combined and recognized on a monthly basis over the
term of the contract. The Company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of third party costs
and direct software installation and implementation costs associated with the initial set up of the
client on the ASP service. These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement.

Software support fees are marketed under annual and multi-year arrangements and are recognized as
revenue ratably over the contracted support term. Hardware and sublicensed software maintenance
revenues are recognized ratably over the contracted maintenance term.



Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are
recognized ratably over the contracted terms.

Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized when delivered to the client,
assuming title and risk of loss have transferred to the client.

Where the Company has contractually agreed to develop new or customized software code for a client
as a single element arrangement, the Company utilizes percentage of completion accounting,
labor-hours method, in accordance with SOP 81-1.

In England, the Company has contracted with third parties to customize software and provide
implementation and support services under long term arrangements (nine years). Prior to 2008 the
Company accounted for the arrangements as single units of accounting under SOP 81-1 because the
arrangements require customization and development of software, and fair value for the support
services had not been established. Also prior to 2008 the Company believed it is was reasonably
assured that no loss would be incurred under these arrangements and therefore it utilized the zero
margin approach of applying percentage-of-completion accounting. During 2008 the Company
established fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement that are not subject to
percentage of completion accounting. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company realized
a significant milestone in London which significantly enhances the Company’s ability to reliably
estimate work effort for the remainder of the contract and estimate a minimum level of profit on
the arrangement. These events, combined with the Company’s experience since the contract signed in
2006 and the experience gained in the South, allowed the Company to conclude that reasonably
dependable work effort estimates could be produced and allow for margin recognition. As a result,
the Company’s fourth quarter 2008 revenues included a cumulative catch-up adjustment, resulting
from the significant change in accounting estimate, in the amount of $28,640,000 which represents
the margin on the contract which had been previously deferred as a result of the zero margin
approach of applying percentage of completion accounting. Greater
than a majority of the catch-up adjustment
revenue was included in support, maintenance and services. The remaining margin attributed to the
services subject to SOP 81-1 will be recognized over the remaining service period until the
services are complete and amounts allocated to the other support services subject to SOP 97-2 will
be recognized over the relevant support periods. The contract expires in 2014.

Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, support, maintenance and other
services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed
and revenue has not been recognized. Long-term deferred revenue at January 3, 2009, represents
amounts received from software support and maintenance services to be earned or provided beginning
in periods on or after January 4, 2009.

The Company incurs out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its client service activities,
primarily travel, which are reimbursed by its clients. The amounts of “out-of-pocket” expenses and
equal amounts of related reimbursements were $37,759,000, $36,778,000, and $39,051,000 for the
years ended January 3, 2009, December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, respectively.

The Company’s arrangements with clients typically include an initial payment due upon contract
signing and date-based licensed software payment terms and payments based upon delivery for
services, hardware and sublicensed software. The Company has periodically provided long-term
financing options to creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has
directly provided extended payment terms to clients from contract date. These extended payment
term arrangements typically provide for date based payments over periods ranging from 12 months up
to seven years. Pursuant to SOP 97-2, because a significant portion of the fee is due beyond one
year, the Company has analyzed its history with these types of arrangements and has concluded that
it has a standard business practice of using extended payment term arrangements and a long history
of successfully collecting under the original payment terms for arrangements with similar clients,
product offerings, and economics without granting concessions. Accordingly, the Company considers
the fee to be fixed and determinable in these extended payment term arrangements and, thus, the
timing of revenue is not impacted by the existence of extended payments. Some of these payment
streams have been assigned on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The
Company accounts for the assignment of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in FASB
Statement No. 140, “

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets  and



Extinguishments
of Liabilities"

. Provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company recognizes
revenue for these arrangements under its normal revenue recognition criteria, and if appropriate,
net of any payment discounts from financing transactions.

The terms of the Company’s software license agreements with its clients generally provide for a
limited indemnification of such intellectual property against losses, expenses and liabilities
arising from third party claims based on alleged infringement by the Company’s solutions of an
intellectual property right of such third party. The terms of such indemnification often limit the
scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace
or modify an infringing solution. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its clients
for any losses related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to third party intellectual
property infringement claims. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification
claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of
the corresponding agreements with its clients, the Company cannot determine the maximum amount of
potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions.

(d)

Fiscal Year

- The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal
year 2008 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2007 and 2006 consisted of 52 weeks each. All
references to years in these notes to consolidated financial statements represent fiscal years
unless otherwise noted.

(e)

Software Development Costs

- Costs incurred internally in creating computer software products
are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed
program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently
reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized
based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual
amortization equal to the straight-line amortization over the estimated economic life of the
solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. During 2008, 2007, and
2006, the Company capitalized $69,981,000, $65,985,000, and $60,943,000, respectively, of total
software development costs of $291,368,000, $283,086,000, and $262,163,000, respectively.
Amortization expense of capitalized software development costs in 2008, 2007, and 2006 was
$51,132,000, $53,475,000, and $45,750,000, respectively, and accumulated amortization was
$410,407,000, $356,485,000, and $303,010,000, respectively.
Included in 2007 total software development costs is $8.6 million of research and development
activities for the

RxStation

medical dispensing devices. $3.4 million of this amount recorded in
2007 is related to periods prior to 2007 and is immaterial to both 2007 and the prior periods to
which it relates.

(f)

Cash Equivalents

- Cash equivalents consist of short-term marketable securities with original
maturities less than 90 days.

(g)

Short-term Investments -

The Company’s short-term investments are primarily invested in
commercial paper. Refer to Note (6) and Note (7) for a comprehensive description of these assets
and their value.

(h)

Long-term Investments

- The Company’s long-term investments are primarily invested in auction
rate securities. Refer to Note (6) and Note (7) for a comprehensive description of these assets
and their value.

(i)

Inventory

- Inventory consists primarily of computer hardware, sublicensed software held for
resale and

RxStation

medication dispensing units. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

(j)

Property and Equipment

- Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over periods of
two to 50 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using a straight-line method
over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives, which range from periods of two to 15
years.

(k)

Earnings per Common Share

- Basic earnings per share (EPS) excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in



the earnings of the Company. A
reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share
computations are as follows:

end of 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because they were antidilutive.

(l)

Foreign Currency

- Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency
is the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The
net exchange differences resulting from these translations are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statements of operations. The net gain resulting from foreign currency
transactions is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations and amounted to $9,858,000, $3,691,000, and $3,764,000 in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.

(m)

Income Taxes

- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

(n)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets -

The Company accounts for goodwill under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator.
All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which are the same as our operating segments
(Domestic & Global), where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company
assesses its goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of its fiscal year. There was no
impairment of goodwill in 2008 and 2007. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to
determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods tested. The Company evaluated for
potential interim impairment indicators in 2007 and 2008, and there were no indicators that
suggested goodwill was impaired on an interim basis. The Company’s intangible assets, other than
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives, are all subject to amortization, are amortized
on a straight-line basis, and are summarized as follows:

the global segment was $19,733,000 and $18,408,000, respectively.

(o)

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(p)

Concentrations

- Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Company’s
cash equivalents consist of money market funds. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and,
therefore, bear minimal risk.

Substantially all of the Company’s clients are integrated delivery networks, physicians, hospitals
and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to
impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Company’s access
to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers.
The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future
results.



At January 3, 2009, more than ten percent of total net receivables represent accounts receivable
and contract receivable related to a contract with Fujitsu that was terminated in the second
quarter of 2008 when Fujitsu withdrew from the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate
clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern region of England. While
uncertainties may exist, the Company expects to collect these receivables in full based on the
terms of the contract.

During
the second quarter, Fujitsu Services Limited’s contract as the
prime contractor in the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to
automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the
Southern region of England was terminated. This had the effect of
automatically terminating the Company’s subcontract for the
project. At January 3, 2009, more than ten percent of total net
receivables represent accounts receivable and contracts receivable
related to that subcontract. The Company and Fujitsu are in dispute
regarding the receivables and are working to resolve these issues
based on processes provided for in the contract. While uncertainties
exist related to the ultimate collectability of the receivables,
management believes that it has valid and equitable grounds for
recovery of such amounts and that collection of recorded amounts are
probable.

(q)

Accounting for Share-based payments —

The Company follows SFAS No. 123(R), “

Share-Based
Payments”

to account for share-based awards. SFAS No. 123R addresses the accounting for
share-based payment transactions with employees and other third parties and requires that the
compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of
earnings. Refer to Note (9) for a detailed discussion of share-based payments.

(r)

Reclassifications —

Certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

(s)

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —

The Company follows Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, to account for its derivative and hedging activities.

The Company has issued foreign-denominated debt to manage its foreign currency exposure related to
its net investment in its subsidiary in England. Beginning in 2006, at the beginning of each
quarterly period, the Company designated a portion (between £60 million and £63 million during the
year) of its debt (£65 million), which is denominated in Great Britain Pounds, to hedge its net
investment in a subsidiary in England. During 2007 and 2008 the Company designated all £65 million
of its debt that is denominated in Great Britain Pounds. For the year ended January 3, 2009,
approximately $22 million, net of approximately $13 million of tax, of decreases in the debt
related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate were included in accumulated other
comprehensive income. For the year ended December 29, 2007 approximately $1.5 million, net of
approximately $1 million of tax, of increases in the debt related to changes in the foreign
currency exchange rate were included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

(t)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements —

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), “Fair Value
Measurements.” This statement establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value when
accounting rules require the use of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. On February 12, 2008, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2. This FSP defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities within the
scope of the FSP. The Company adopted SFAS 157 for fair value measurement outside of the scope of
FSP No. FAS 157-2 on December 30, 2007. On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3
that clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active. FSP No. FAS 157-3 is
effective for all periods presented in accordance with SFAS 157 and the Company has considered the
guidance with respect to the valuation of its financial assets and their designation within the
fair value hierarchy. The Company was required to fully adopt SFAS 157 as of the first day of the
2009 fiscal year and does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised
2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)) which replaces SFAS 141 and supersedes FIN 4,
“Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method”. SFAS 141(R) establishes guidelines for how an acquirer measures and recognizes the
identifiable assets, goodwill, noncontrolling interest, and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Additionally, SFAS 141(R) outlines the disclosures necessary to allow financial
statement users to assess the impact of the acquisition. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of adoption of SFAS 141(R), which will depend on future acquisition activity, and will be
required to adopt SFAS 141(R) prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after the
first day of the 2009 fiscal year.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (SFAS
160), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”, which amends ARB No. 51.
SFAS 160 guides that



a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the
consolidated financial statements, and that net income should be reported at amounts that include
the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adoption of SFAS 160 on its results of operations and its
financial position, both of which are expected to be immaterial, and was required to adopt SFAS 160
as of the first day of the 2009 fiscal year.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”. SFAS 161
requires enhanced disclosures about the uses of derivative instruments and hedging activities, how
these activities are accounted for, and their respective impact on an entity’s financial position,
financial performance, and cash flows. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption
of SFAS 161 on its results of operations and its financial position, which is
expected to be immaterial, and was required to adopt SFAS 161 as of the first day of the 2009
fiscal year.

(2) Business Acquisitions

During the three years ended January 3, 2009, the Company completed three acquisitions, which were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The results of each acquisition are
included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations from the date of each acquisition.
Below is a description of the acquisitions.

On August 1, 2008, the Company completed the purchase of LingoLogix, Inc. (“LingoLogix”), for
$4,000,000. LingoLogix was a provider of software used for computer automated coding technology.
The acquisition of LingoLogix has enhanced the Company’s revenue cycling offerings as the solutions
can be used in both inpatient and outpatient environments to improve physician workflow and drive
more accurate and efficient reimbursement through automated coding. The operating results of
LingoLogix were combined with those of the Company subsequent to the purchase date of August 1,
2008. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identified tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in goodwill of $1,253,000 and
$4,053,000 in intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over 5 years. The
goodwill was allocated to the reporting unit. Pro-forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effect of this acquisition was not material to the Company.

On February 22, 2007, the Company completed the purchase of assets of Etreby Computer Company, Inc.
(“Etreby”), for $25,120,000, which was reduced by $1,588,000 for a working capital adjustment in
the second quarter of 2007. Etreby was a software provider of retail pharmacy management systems.
The acquisition of Etreby’s assets has expanded the Company’s pharmacy systems portfolio. The
operating results of Etreby were combined with those of the Company subsequent to the purchase date
of February 22, 2007. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the
identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in goodwill of
$12,676,000 and $10,181,000 in intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over
five years. The goodwill was allocated to the reporting unit and is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes. Pro-forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of this
acquisition was not material to the Company.

On July 5, 2006, the Company completed the purchase of Galt Associates, Inc., now known as Cerner
Galt, Inc. (“Galt”) for $13,766,000, net of cash acquired. Galt is a provider of safety and risk
management solutions for pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies. The
acquisition of Galt has enhanced the Company’s LifeSciences portfolio by adding solutions and
services that use medical event data to monitor and manage the safety and effectiveness of various
therapies. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identified
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulted in goodwill of $9,298,000
and $4,266,000 in intangible assets. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods
between two and five years. The goodwill was allocated to the reporting unit.

All of the goodwill for the above acquisitions has been allocated to the Company’s Domestic
operating segment.

A summary of the Company’s purchase acquisitions for the three years ended January 3, 2009, is

(3) Receivables

Receivables consist of accounts receivable and contracts receivable. Accounts receivable represent
recorded revenues that have been billed. Contracts receivable represent recorded revenues that are
billable by the Company at future dates under the terms of a contract with a client. Billings and
other consideration received on contracts in excess of related revenues recognized are recorded as
deferred revenue. Substantially all receivables are derived from sales and related support and
maintenance and professional services of the Company’s clinical, administrative and financial
information systems and solutions to healthcare providers located throughout the United States and
in certain non-U.S. countries. A summary of receivables is as follows:

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally does not require
collateral from its clients. The Company provides an allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts based on specific identification, historical experience and management’s judgment. At the
end of 2008 and 2007 the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts was $18,149,000 and
$15,469,000, respectively.

During the second quarter, Fujitsu Services Limited’s contract as the prime contractor in the
National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical
records in the Southern region of England was terminated.  This had the effect of automatically
terminating the Company’s subcontract for the project.  At January 3, 2009, more than ten percent of total net receivables represent accounts receivable and contracts receivable related
to that subcontract.  The Company and Fujitsu are in dispute regarding the receivables and are working to resolve these issues based on processes provided for in the contract.  While
uncertainties exist related to the ultimate collectability of the receivables, management believes
that it has valid and equitable grounds for recovery of such amounts and that collection of
recorded amounts are probable.

During 2008 and 2007, the Company received total client cash collections of $1,729,526,000 and
$1,646,584,000, respectively, of which $89,881,000 and $88,286,000 were received from third party
arrangements with non-recourse payment assignments.

In November 2005, the Company completed a £65,000,000 ($94,556,000 at January 3, 2009) private
placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven
equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain
restrictions on the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2009.

In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57% were paid in
full in 2008. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable
in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the
outstanding amount under the Company’s credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The
Note Agreement contains certain net worth and



fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to
borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at January 3, 2009.

In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit
agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on
November 30, 2006 and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes.
The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only.
Interest is payable at the Company’s option at a rate based on prime (3.25% at January 3, 2009) or
LIBOR (1.41% at January 3, 2009) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15% if
certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio,
and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to
borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends. A commitment fee of .2% is payable quarterly
based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May
31, 2010. As of January 3, 2009, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement
and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at January 3, 2009.

In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note
Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14% were paid in
full in 2006. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable
in six equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire
the Company’s existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital
improvements and to strengthen the Company’s cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain
net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on
the Company’s ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2009.

In March 2004, the Company issued a $7,500,000 promissory note to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of
which $2,500,000 was repaid in October 2004. The balance of the note was paid on April 30, 2007.

The Company also has capital lease obligations amounting to $191,000, payable over the next two
years.

The aggregate maturities for the Company’s long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, are

The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term, fixed-rate debt using a discounted cash flow
analysis based on the Company’s current borrowing rates for debt with similar maturities. The fair
value of the Company’s long-term debt was approximately $159,349,000 and $173,675,000 at January 3,
2009 and December 29, 2007, respectively.



(6) Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement establishes a
single authoritative definition of fair value to be used when accounting rules require the use of
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
fair value measurement. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS
157-2. This FSP defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008 for items within the scope of the FSP. On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3
that clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active. FSP No. FAS 157-3 is
effective for all periods presented in accordance with SFAS 157 and the Company has considered the
guidance with respect to the valuation of its financial assets and their designation within the
fair value hierarchy.

On December 30, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
except for portions related to the non-financial assets and liabilities within the scope of the
deferral provided by FSP No. FAS 157-2. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by
SFAS No. 157 are as follows:

•

Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities.

•

Level 3 — Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity
and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The following table details the fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy of our
financial assets:

Short term available-for-sale securities consist of commercial paper on the consolidated balance
sheet, whereas long term trading securities represent the value of the Company’s investment in
auction rate securities. The Company utilizes valuation models with observable market data inputs
to estimate the fair value of its commercial paper. Refer to Note (7) for a comprehensive
description of these assets.

In February and March 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure
of auctions representing all the auction rate securities held by the Company. As a result, at the
end of the first quarter of 2008 the Company assessed the decline in fair value of the securities
as a temporary impairment.

Based upon the change in the market and unavailability of observable inputs for auction rate
securities during the first quarter, the Company changed its valuation methodology to a discounted
cash flow model based on various estimates, which changed the input category from level 1 to level
3 (significant unobservable inputs) within the SFAS 157 hierarchy. Included in the inputs are the
current coupon rates, the interest rate environment, the credit rating of the issuers, the Federal
Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) guarantee, and the insurance issued by monoline insurance
companies.



Since the first quarter, overall market conditions have not improved and auctions continue to fail.
At January 3, 2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a par value of $105,300,000.
The Company’s updated valuation model resulted in an estimated fair value of $85,440,000.

In November 2008, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the
investment firm that sold the Company its auction rate securities. Under the terms of the
Settlement Agreement, the Company received the right to redeem the securities at par value during a
period from June 2010 through June 2012. The right to redeem the securities is being treated
similar to a put option, which the Company has elected to measure under the fair value option of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS No. 159), “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The Company’s valuation model resulted in an
estimated fair value of $19,860,000 for the value of the put-like feature, which was recognized in
other income. Consequently, changes in the fair value of the Settlement Agreement will continue to
be recorded in income.

Concurrently with the recognition of the put-like feature, the Company transferred the auction rate
securities from available-for-sale to trading securities. As a result of the transfer, the Company
recognized a pre-tax, other-than-temporary impairment loss of approximately $19,860,000 in other
income. As trading securities, changes in the fair value of the investments will continue to be
recorded in income. The recording of both the put-like feature and the recognition of the
other-than-temporary impairment loss resulted in no impact to the Consolidated Statements of
Operating Earnings for the year ended January 3, 2009.

The table below presents the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
significant unobservable inputs (level 3) as defined in SFAS 157 at January 3, 2009.

The effect of adopting the required portions of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company was required to fully adopt SFAS 157 as
of the first day of the 2009 fiscal year and does not expect its adoption to have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. At the end of the 2008 fiscal year, categories
where SFAS 157 had not been applied consisted of goodwill and intangible assets.

(7) Marketable Securities

As of January 3, 2009, the Company held investments in commercial paper along with auction rate
securities. Commercial paper consists of short-term corporate debt with maturities of less than
three months. All of the commercial paper held at January 3, 2009 was rated P1/A1 or higher.

Auction rate securities are debt instruments with long-term nominal maturities, for which the
interest rates regularly reset every 7-35 days under an auction system. Because auction rate
securities historically re-priced frequently, they traded in the market on par-in, par-out basis.
In prior periods, the Company regularly liquidated its investments in these securities for reasons
including, among others, changes in the market interest rates and changes in the availability of
and the yield on alternative investments. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the
global credit markets resulted in the progressive failure of auctions representing all of the
auction rate
securities we hold, because the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded
the amount of



bids. To date we have collected all interest receivable on our auction rate securities when due and
expect to continue to do so in the future; however, the principal associated with failed auctions
will not be accessible until successful auctions occur, a buyer is found outside of the auction
process, the issuers establish a different form of financing to replace these securities, or final
payments come due according to contractual maturities ranging from 13 to 30 years.

In August 2008, our broker agreed to a settlement in principle with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the New York Attorney General and other regulatory agencies to restore liquidity to
clients who hold auction rate securities. In November 2008, the Company entered into a Settlement
Agreement with our broker. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company will have the
ability to redeem the securities at par during a period from mid-2010 through mid-2012.
Additionally, the Company has the option to obtain a loan, secured by such securities, at no net
cost prior to the redemption period.

During the fourth quarter of 2008 and in conjunction with the execution of the Settlement
Agreement, the Company transferred the auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading
securities. As trading securities, these investments are carried at fair value with changes
recorded through earnings. At January 3, 2009, the Company held auction rate securities with a par
value of $105,300,000. In the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company recognized a pre-tax,
other-than-temporary impairment loss of $19,860,000 through earnings.

The Settlement Agreement is being accounted for as a put-like feature under the fair value option
of SFAS 159. Accordingly, the feature is carried at fair value with changes recorded through
earnings. The Company has valued the put-like feature as the difference between the par value of
the auction rate securities and the fair value of the securities, discounted by the credit risk of
the broker. The loan option was also valued taking into account the settlement discount and credit
risk during the time necessary to administer the loan. At January 3, 2009, the Company valued the
put-like feature at $19,860,000 which was recognized through earnings. The Company anticipates
that any future changes in the fair value of the put-like feature will be substantially offset by
changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

All of the auction rate securities that the Company currently holds are A rated or higher and are
collateralized by student loan portfolios, the majority of which are backed by the U.S. government
through its Federal Family Education Loan Program.

Management regularly reviews investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and
qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of the
market decline, our intent and ability to hold to maturity or until forecasted recovery, and the
financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer. Unrealized losses that are other than
temporary are recognized in earnings. We do not believe the auction failures will materially impact
our ability to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures or other business requirements.

During 2008, the Company had two shareholder approved long-term incentive plans from which it could
issue grants.

Under the 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan F, the Company is authorized to grant to associates,
directors and consultants 4,000,000 shares of common stock awards taking into account the
stock-split effective January 10, 2006. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options,
restricted stock and performance shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock and performance unit awards which may be payable in the form of common stock or cash
at the Company’s discretion. However, not more than 1,000,000 of such shares will be available for
granting any types of grants other than options or stock appreciation rights. Options under Plan F
are exercisable at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant as determined by
the Stock Option Committee. Options under this plan typically vest over a period of five years as
determined by the Stock Option Committee and are exercisable for periods of up to 25 years.

Under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan G, the Company is authorized to grant to associates and
directors 4,000,000 shares of common stock awards taking into account the stock-split effective
January 10, 2006. Awards under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted stock and
performance shares, as well as other awards such as stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and
performance unit awards which may be payable in the form of common stock or cash at the Company’s
discretion. Options under Plan G are exercisable at a price not less than fair market value on the
date of grant as determined by the Stock Option Committee. Options under this plan typically vest
over a period of five years as determined by the Stock Option Committee and are exercisable for
periods of up to 12 years. In 2007, Long-Term Incentive Plan
G was amended to provide the Company the ability to recover fringe benefit tax payments made by the
Company on behalf of its associates in India.

The fair market value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice
option-pricing model. In 2006, the Company changed its valuation model from the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to the



lattice pricing model because it is believed to provide greater flexibility for valuing the
substantive characteristics of employee share instruments, resulting in a more accurate estimate of
fair market value. The pricing model requires the use of the following estimates and assumptions:

•

Expected volatilities under the lattice model are based on an equal weighting of implied
volatilities from traded options on the Company’s shares and historical volatility. The
Company uses historical data to estimate the stock option exercise and associate departure
behavior used in the lattice model; groups of associates (executives and non-executives)
that have similar historical behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes.

•

The expected term of stock options granted is derived from the output of the lattice
model and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be
outstanding; the range given below results from certain groups of associates exhibiting
different post-vesting behaviors.

•

The risk-free rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to
the contractual term of the awards.

The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of stock options
are as follows:

$1,380,000, and $1,031,000, respectively.

Associate Stock Purchase Plan

The Company established an Associate Stock Purchase Plan (ASPP) in 2001, which qualifies under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Each individual employed by the Company and associates
of the Company’s United States based subsidiaries, except as provided below, are eligible to
participate in the Plan (“Participants”). The following individuals are excluded from
participation: (a) persons who, as of the beginning of a purchase period under the Plan, have been
continuously employed by the Company or its domestic subsidiaries for less than two weeks; (b)
persons who, as of the beginning of a purchase period, own directly or indirectly, or hold options
or rights to acquire under any agreement or Company plan, an aggregate of 5% or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all outstanding shares of all classes of Company Common Stock;
and, (c) persons who are customarily employed by the Company for less than 20 hours per week or for
less than five months in any calendar year. Participants may elect to make contributions from 1%
to 20% of compensation to the ASPP, subject to annual limitations determined by the Internal
Revenue Service. Participants may purchase Company Common Stock at a 15% discount on the last
business day of the purchase period. The purchase of the Company’s Common Stock is made through
the ASPP on the open market and subsequently reissued to the associates. Under FAS123R, the
difference of the open market purchase and the participant’s purchase price is being recognized as
compensation expense.

Treasury Stock

In March 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $45 million of
our Common Stock on the open market and/or in privately-negotiated purchase. The stock repurchase
activity as of January 3, 2009 is as follows:

Shares repurchased

790,000

Average price per share

$

35.45

Cost of shares repurchased, net of commissions

$

28,002,000

These repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and are accounted for under the cost
method. No repurchased shares have been retired.



(10) Foundations Retirement Plan

The Cerner Corporation Foundations Retirement Plan (the Plan) is established under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code. All associates over age 18 and not a member of an excluded class are
eligible to participate. Participants may elect to make pretax contributions from 1% to 80% of
eligible compensation to the Plan, subject to annual limitations determined by the Internal Revenue
Service. Participants may direct contributions into mutual funds, a stable value fund, a Company
stock fund, or a self-directed brokerage account. The Company makes matching contributions to the
Plan, on behalf of participants, in an amount equal to 33% of the first 6% of the participant’s
salary contribution. The Company’s expenses for the Plan amounted to $8,669,000, $8,280,000, and
$7,791,000 for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The Company added a second tier discretionary match to the Plan in 2000. Contributions are based
on attainment of established earnings per share goals for the year or the established financial
metric for the Plan. Only participants who defer 2% of their base salary, are actively employed as
of the last day of the Plan year and are employed before October 1

st

of the Plan year
are eligible to receive the discretionary match contribution. For the years ended 2008, 2007, and
2006 the Company expensed $2,228,000, $6,019,000, and $6,638,000 for discretionary distributions,
respectively.

During 2007, the Company determined that due to a change in circumstances, it is more likely than
not that certain tax operating loss carry-forwards in a non-U.S. jurisdiction would not be realized
resulting in the recognition of a valuation allowance totaling approximately $7,982,000. During
2008, this non-U.S. jurisdiction audited the Company. As a result of the audit, certain tax
positions previously taken were disallowed by the foreign jurisdiction, which reduced the deferred
tax asset relating to the net operating loss carryforward in that jurisdiction. The valuation
allowance related to the net operating loss carryforward was released because management believes
it is more likely than not the Company will realize the remaining operating loss carry-forward
amount. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods which the remaining deferred tax assets are expected to be deductible, as
well as the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, management believes it is more likely
than not the Company will realize the remaining deferred tax assets and no valuation allowance is
required. At January 3, 2009, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards subject to Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code for Federal income tax purposes of $14.9 million which are
available to offset future Federal taxable income, if any, through 2020.



The effective income tax rates for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were 33%, 38%, and 34%, respectively.
These effective rates differ from the Federal statutory rate of 35% as follows:

The 2008, 2007 and 2006 tax expense amounts include the recognition of approximately $2,879,000,
$3,125,000 and $1,994,000 respectively of tax benefits for items related to prior periods. The
2008 amount was related to an adjustment of a foreign tax credit claimed. The adjustments in 2007
were recorded primarily to correct an error in the Company’s 2006 state income tax rate. These
differences have accumulated over several years and the impact to any one of these prior periods is
not material. The 2006 amounts relate to tax credits taken on prior income tax returns and to
correct an error in prior years’ effective foreign tax rate, which had accumulated over several
years.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an interpretation of
the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
This interpretation clarifies how companies calculate and disclose uncertain tax positions. The
effect of adopting this interpretation did not impact any previously recorded amounts for
unrecognized tax benefits.

The 2008 beginning and ending amounts of accrued interest related to the underpayment of taxes was
$202,000 and $925,000, respectively. The Company classifies interest and penalties as income tax
expense in its consolidated statement of earnings, which is consistent with how the Company
previously classified interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes. No
accrual for tax penalties was recorded upon adoption of FIN 48 or at the end of the year.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits including interest was $8,069,000 as of December 29,
2007. During 2008, the Company settled IRS examinations for the 2005 to 2006 periods and as a
result reversed previously recorded reserves for tax uncertainties by $1,319,000. The years after
2006 remain open. As of January 3, 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including
interest, was $12,440,000. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the Company
will resolve some of the matters which may decrease unrecognized tax benefits for these open tax
years by $1,000,000. Any settlement of those unrecognized tax benefits will affect the effective
tax rate of the Company.

(12) Related Party Transactions

For the first half of 2008 and prior years, the Company leased an airplane from PANDI, Inc.
(PANDI), a company owned by Mr. Neal L. Patterson and Mr. Clifford W. Illig, the Company’s
Chairman/CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board, respectively. The airplane was leased on a per mile
basis with no minimum usage guarantee. The lease rate was believed to approximate fair market
value for this type of aircraft. During 2008, 2007 and 2006 the Company paid an aggregate of
$423,000, $661,000, and $670,000 for the rental of the airplane, respectively. The airplane was
used principally by Mr. Trace Devanny, President, and Mr. Mike Valentine, Executive Vice President,
to make client visits. On August 14, 2008, the PANDI aircraft was sold by PANDI to a third party,
which has the effect of terminating the lease agreement with the Company.

On February 6, 2007, the Company entered into an Aircraft Service Agreement between Rockcreek
Aviation, Inc. (the Company’s wholly-owned flight operations subsidiary) and PANDI. Under this
agreement Rockcreek Aviation provided flight operations services to PANDI with respect to PANDI’s
aircraft. PANDI owned and operated a Beechcraft, BeechJet 400 for the first half of 2008. During
2008, the aircraft services fees paid by PANDI to the Company were $297,000. On August 14, 2008,
the PANDI aircraft was sold by PANDI to a third party, which had the effect of terminating the
Aircraft Service Agreement between Rockcreek Aviation and PANDI.



(13) Commitments

In prior years, the Company leased space to unrelated parties in its North Kansas City headquarters
complex and in other business locations under noncancelable operating leases. Included in other
revenues is rental income of $305,000 in 2006. The Company did not receive rental income in 2007
or 2008.

The Company is committed under operating leases for office space and computer equipment through
October 2027. Rent expense for office and warehouse space for the Company’s regional and global
offices for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $16,091,000, $12,436,000 and $11,391,000, respectively.

(14) Segment Reporting

The Company has two operating segments, Domestic and Global. Revenues are derived primarily from
the sale of clinical, financial and administrative information systems and solutions. The cost of
revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed
software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also
includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the
manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred by the geographic business segments consist of sales
and client service expenses including salaries of sales and client service personnel,
communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Performance of the segments is assessed
at the operating earnings level and, therefore, the segment operations have been presented as such.
“Other” includes revenues not generated by the operating segments and expenses such as software
development, marketing, general and administrative, share-based compensation expense and
depreciation that has not been allocated to the operating segments. It is impractical for the
Company to track assets by geographical business segment.

Accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those used on a
consolidated basis. The following table presents a summary of the operating information for the
years ended January 3, 2009, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006.

Includes margin of $28.6 million related to the Company’s contract in London as
part of the National Health Services (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes
and digitize medical records in England. This represents a one-time catch-up resulting
from a change in accounting estimate and the ability to separate the support services
element of the contract. The after tax effect of this item increased fourth quarter
2008 net earnings and diluted earnings per share by $20.6 million and $0.24,
respectively
