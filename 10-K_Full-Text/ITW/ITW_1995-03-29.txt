                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

    GENERAL --

    Illinois  Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") manufactures and markets a variety
of products and systems that  provide specific, problem-solving solutions for  a
diverse  customer base worldwide. The Company has more than 260 operations in 33
countries.  The  Company's  business  units  are  divided  into  two   segments:
Engineered  Components, and Industrial Systems  and Consumables. Products in the
Company's Engineered  Components segment  include  short lead-time  plastic  and
metal  components, fasteners  and assemblies;  industrial fluids  and adhesives;
fastening tools  and  welding  equipment. Industrial  Systems  and  Consumables'
products  include longer lead-time systems  and related consumables for consumer
and industrial packaging;  industrial spray  coating equipment  and systems  and
quality assurance applications equipment and systems.

    In March 1993, the Company acquired the Miller Group Ltd., a manufacturer of
arc welding equipment, through an exchange of ITW voting Common Stock for all of
the  voting  Common Stock  of  Miller. As  a  result, the  acquisition  has been
accounted for as a  pooling of interests in  conformity with Generally  Accepted
Accounting  Principles,  specifically  paragraphs 46  through  48  of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion  No. 16.  Accordingly, the results  of operations  have
been included in the Statement of Income as of the beginning of 1993. The impact
of  Miller on  consolidated operating  revenues, net  income and  net income per
share for  1993 and  1992 was  not significant.  Therefore, the  1992  financial
statements have not been restated to reflect the acquisition of Miller.

    In  1990, the Company  acquired substantially all  of the net  assets of the
DeVilbiss   Industrial/Commercial   businesses   of   Eagle   Industries,   Inc.
("DeVilbiss").  The  DeVilbiss  businesses manufacture  products  and engineered
systems  used  for  product   finishing  and  coating  applications,   including
conventional  air spray equipment, powder-coating  devices and robotic finishing
systems. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and,  accordingly,
the results of operations have been included in the Statement of Income from the
acquisition date.

    In  1991, the Company sold certain net  assets and technology related to the
automotive finishing  systems  business. The  revenues,  income and  net  assets
related to the automotive finishing systems business were not material.

    During  the five-year period ending December  31, 1994, the Company acquired
and disposed of a number of other  businesses, none of which individually had  a
material impact on consolidated results.

    CURRENT YEAR DEVELOPMENTS --

    Refer  to pages 19 through 21,  Management's Discussion and Analysis, in the
Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS --

    The percentage contributions to operating revenues for the last three  years
by industry segment are as follows:



    Segment  and geographic  data are  included on  pages 19,  20 and  25 of the
Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders.


    The principal markets served by the Company's two segments are as follows:



    Operating results of the segments  are described on pages  19, 20 and 25  of
the Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    BACKLOG --

    Backlog  generally is not  considered a significant  factor in the Company's
businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are
characteristic of many of its products.

    The following summarizes backlog by industry segment as of December 31, 1994
and 1993:



    Backlog orders scheduled  for shipment  beyond calendar year  1995 were  not
material in either industry segment as of December 31, 1994.

    The following information is equally applicable to both industry segments of
the business unless otherwise noted:

    COMPETITION --

    The  Company's global competitive environment is complex because of the wide
diversity of  products  the Company  manufactures  and the  markets  it  serves.
Depending  on the  product or  market, the  Company may  compete with  few other
companies or with many firms, some of which may be the Company's own licensees.

    The Company is a leading producer of plastic and metal fastening  components
and assemblies; adhesives and fluids; packaging systems and related consumables;
finishing  and static control systems and products; quality assurance equipment;
tooling for specialty applications; and arc welding equipment.

    RAW MATERIALS --

    The Company  uses  raw materials  of  various types,  primarily  metals  and
plastics  that are available from  numerous commercial sources. The availability
of materials and energy has not resulted in any business interruptions or  other
major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT --

    The Company's growth has resulted from developing new and improved products,
broadening  the  application  of  established  products,  continuing  efforts to
improve and develop new methods, processes and


equipment, and  from acquisitions.  Many  new products  are designed  to  reduce
customers' costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing
the  number of parts in  an assembly, or by  improving the quality of customers'
assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is  accomplished
by  working  closely  with  customers  on  specific  applications.  Identifiable
research and development costs are  set forth on page  26 of the Company's  1994
Annual Report to Stockholders.

    The  Company  owns  approximately  1,640  unexpired  United  States  patents
covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have
also been obtained in  various foreign countries. In  addition, the Company  has
approximately  333 applications for patents pending  in the United States Patent
Office, but there is no  assurance that any patent  will be issued. The  Company
maintains  an active  patent department  for the  administration of  patents and
processing of patent applications.

    The Company licenses some of its patents to other companies, from which  the
Company  collects royalties. The  Company believes that many  of its patents are
valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in  the
markets  it serves  to engineering capability;  manufacturing techniques, skills
and efficiency;  marketing and  sales  promotion; and  service and  delivery  of
quality products to its customers.

    TRADEMARKS --

    Many  of the Company's  products are sold under  various trademarks owned or
licensed by the  Company. Among the  most significant are:  ITW, Signode,  Apex,
Buildex,  Deltar, Devcon,  DeVilbiss, Fastex, Hi-Cone,  Keps, Magnaflux, Miller,
Minigrip, Paslode, Ransburg, Ramset, Shakeproof, Teks, Tenax, and Zip-Pak.

    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION --

    The Company  believes  that its  plants  and equipment  are  in  substantial
compliance  with  applicable environmental  regulations. Additional  measures to
maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company's  capital
expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

    Various  legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental
issues have become  effective or are  under consideration in  many parts of  the
world  relating  to manufacturing  processes,  and the  sale  or use  of certain
products. To date, such developments have  not had a substantial adverse  impact
on the Company's sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to
develop  and  sell  environmentally  compatible products  resulting  in  new and
expanding marketing opportunities.

    EMPLOYEES --

    The Company employed approximately  19,500 persons as  of December 31,  1994
and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

    INTERNATIONAL --

    The  Company's international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures
and licensees in  33 countries on  six continents. These  operations serve  such
markets  as  automotive, beverage  and  food, construction,  general industrial,
packaging  and  others  on  a  worldwide  basis.  The  Company's   international
subsidiaries  contributed approximately 36%  of operating revenues  in both 1994
and 1993.

    Refer to pages 19 and 20 in the Company's 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders
for additional information on international activities. International operations
are subject  to  certain  risks  inherent  in  conducting  business  in  foreign
countries,   including  price   controls,  exchange   controls,  limitations  on
participation in  local enterprises,  nationalization, expropriation  and  other
governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.


    EXECUTIVE OFFICERS --

    Executive Officers of the Company as of March 7, 1995:



    Except  for Messrs.  Hudnut and Karpan,  each of the  foregoing officers has
been employed by the Company in various executive capacities for more than  five
years.  The executive officers of the Company serve at the pleasure of the Board
of Directors. Mr. Hudnut  joined the Company in  January 1992 having  previously
served  as Senior Vice President, General Counsel  and Secretary of MBIA Inc., a
financial guarantor,  and  Vice  President, General  Counsel  and  Secretary  of
Scovill  Inc., a diversified manufacturer. Mr. Karpan joined the Company in June
1990 having previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Butler
Fixture Company,  a manufacturer  of commercial  fixtures, and  Vice  President,
Human Resources and Planning for Borg Warner Automotive, Inc., a manufacturer of
automotive components.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
    As  of  December  31,  1994  the  Company  operated  172  plants  and office
facilities in the United States, excluding regional sales offices and  warehouse
facilities.  Of the  total U.S.  floor space  of 11.4  million square  feet, 7.7
million is owned by  the Company, with the  remaining 3.7 million being  leased.
Internationally,  the Company operated 89 plants and office facilities excluding
regional sales  offices and  warehouse facilities.  Of the  total  international
floor  space of 5.3  million square feet,  3.8 million is  owned by the Company,
with the remaining 1.5 million being leased. The principal international  plants
and  office  facilities  are  in Australia,  Belgium,  Canada,  France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

    Of the  worldwide  plants  and  office  facilities,  133  were  operated  by
businesses  in  the  Engineered Components  segment,  123 by  businesses  in the
Industrial Systems and Consumables segment, and 5 by corporate-related entities.
Of the company-wide square  footage, 8.0 million are  used by businesses in  the
Engineered  Components segment  and 7.7  million are  used by  businesses in the
Industrial Systems and  Consumables segment, with  the remaining square  footage
used as corporate-related facilities.

    The   Company's  properties  are  primarily  of  steel,  brick  or  concrete
construction  and  are  maintained  in  good  operating  condition.   Productive
capacity,  in general, currently  exceeds operating levels.  Capacity levels are
somewhat flexible based on the  number of shifts operated  and on the number  of
overtime hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to time as
required  by  increased  demand. Additions  to  capacity  can be  made  within a
reasonable period of time due to the nature of the businesses.
