                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

    GENERAL --

    Illinois  Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") manufactures and markets a variety
of products and systems that  provide specific, problem-solving solutions for  a
diverse  customer base worldwide. The Company has more than 250 operations in 33
countries.  The  Company's  business  units  are  divided  into  two   segments:
Engineered  Components, and Industrial Systems  and Consumables. Products in the
Company's Engineered  Components segment  include  short lead-time  plastic  and
metal  components and assemblies;  industrial fluids and  adhesives; plastic and
metal fasteners,  and  fastening tools  and  equipment. Industrial  Systems  and
Consumables'  products include longer lead-time  systems and related consumables
for consumer  and industrial  packaging,  finishing, furniture,  inspection  and
quality assurance applications.

    In March 1993, the Company acquired the Miller Group Ltd., a manufacturer of
arc welding equipment, through an exchange of ITW voting Common Stock for all of
the  voting  Common Stock  of  Miller. As  a  result, the  acquisition  has been
accounted for as a  pooling of interests in  conformity with Generally  Accepted
Accounting  Principles,  specifically  paragraphs 46  through  48  of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion  No. 16.  Accordingly, the results  of operations  have
been included in the Statement of Income as of the beginning of 1993. The impact
of  Miller on  consolidated operating  revenues, net  income and  net income per
share for  1993, 1992  and 1991  was not  significant. Therefore,  prior  years'
financial  statements  have  not been  restated  to reflect  the  acquisition of
Miller.

    In 1990, the  Company acquired substantially  all of the  net assets of  the
DeVilbiss   Industrial/Commercial   businesses   of   Eagle   Industries,   Inc.
("DeVilbiss"). The  DeVilbiss  businesses manufacture  products  and  engineered
systems   used  for  product  finishing   and  coating  applications,  including
conventional air spray equipment,  powder-coating devices and robotic  finishing
systems.  The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
the results of operations have been included in the Statement of Income from the
acquisition date.

    In 1989,  the  Company acquired  all  of  the outstanding  common  stock  of
Ransburg  Corporation ("Ransburg") for $192,000,000,  which includes payment for
outstanding options and investment  banking, legal and  accounting fees paid  by
both  parties.  Ransburg  businesses  manufacture  and  distribute electrostatic
finishing systems  for liquid  and  powder coatings.  The acquisition  has  been
accounted  for as  a purchase and,  accordingly, the results  of operations have
been included in the Statement of Income from the acquisition date.

    In 1991, the Company sold certain  net assets and technology related to  the
Ransburg  and DeVilbiss  automotive finishing systems  businesses. The revenues,
income and net  assets related  to the automotive  finishing systems  businesses
were not material.

    During  the five-year period ending December  31, 1993, the Company acquired
and disposed of a number of other  businesses, none of which individually had  a
material impact on consolidated results.

    CURRENT YEAR DEVELOPMENTS --

    Refer  to pages 20 through 22,  Management's Discussion and Analysis, in the
Company's 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS --

    For financial reporting  purposes, the  Company has  grouped its  operations
into  two industry  segments: Engineered  Components and  Industrial Systems and
Consumables. The percentage  contributions to  operating revenues  for the  last
three (3) years by these product categories are:




    Segment and geographic data are included on pages 20 and 26 of the Company's
1993 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    Product data relating to the Company's two segments are located on page 4 of
the  Company's 1993 Annual Report to  Stockholders. The principal markets served
by the Company's two segments are as follows:



    Operating results of the segments  are described on pages  20 and 21 of  the
Company's 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    BACKLOG --

    Backlog  generally is not  considered a significant  factor in the Company's
businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are
characteristic of many of its products.

    The following summarizes backlog by industry segment as of December 31, 1993
and 1992:



    Backlog orders scheduled  for shipment  beyond calendar year  1994 were  not
material in either industry segment as of December 31, 1993.

    The following information is equally applicable to both industry segments of
the business unless otherwise noted:

    COMPETITION --

    The  Company's global competitive environment is complex because of the wide
diversity of  products  the Company  manufactures  and the  markets  it  serves.
Depending  on the  product or  market, the  Company may  compete with  few other
companies or with many firms, some of which may be the Company's own licensees.

    The Company is a leading producer of plastic and metal fastening  components
and assemblies; adhesives and fluids; packaging systems and related consumables;
finishing  and static control systems and products; quality assurance equipment;
tooling for  specialty  applications;  and arc  welding  equipment  and  related
systems.


    RAW MATERIALS --

    The  Company  uses  raw materials  of  various types,  primarily  metals and
plastics that are available from  numerous commercial sources. The  availability
of  materials and energy has not resulted in any business interruptions or other
major problems, nor are any such problems anticipated.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT --

    The Company's growth has resulted from developing new and improved products,
broadening the  application  of  established  products,  continuing  efforts  to
improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions.
Many  new products are designed to  reduce customers' costs by eliminating steps
in their manufacturing processes, reducing the  number of parts in an  assembly,
or  by improving  the quality of  customers' assembled  products. Typically, the
development of such products is  accomplished by working closely with  customers
on  specific applications. Identifiable  research and development  costs are set
forth on page 27 of the Company's 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    The  Company  owns  approximately  1,630  unexpired  United  States  patents
covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have
also  been obtained in  various foreign countries. In  addition, the Company has
approximately 240 applications for patents  pending in the United States  Patent
Office,  but there is no  assurance that any patent  will be issued. The Company
maintains an  active patent  department for  the administration  of patents  and
processing of patent applications.

    The  Company licenses some of its patents to other companies, from which the
Company collects royalties. The  Company believes that many  of its patents  are
valuable  and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the
markets it serves  to engineering capability;  manufacturing techniques,  skills
and  efficiency;  marketing and  sales promotion;  and  service and  delivery of
quality products to its customers.

    TRADEMARKS --

    Many of the Company's  products are sold under  various trademarks owned  or
licensed  by the  Company. Among the  most significant are:  ITW, Signode, Apex,
Buildex, Deltar, Devcon,  DeVilbiss, Fastex, Hi-Cone,  Keps, Magnaflux,  Miller,
Minigrip, Paslode, Ransburg, Ramset, Shakeproof, Teks, Tenax, and Zip-Pak.

    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION --

    The  Company  believes  that its  plants  and equipment  are  in substantial
compliance with  applicable environmental  regulations. Additional  measures  to
maintain  compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company's capital
expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

    Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning  environmental
issues  have become effective  or are under  consideration in many  parts of the
world relating  to manufacturing  processes,  and the  sale  or use  of  certain
products.  To date, such developments have  not had a substantial adverse impact
on the Company's sales or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to
develop and  sell  environmentally  compatible products  resulting  in  new  and
expanding marketing opportunities.

    EMPLOYEES --

    The  Company employed approximately  19,000 persons as  of December 31, 1993
and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

    INTERNATIONAL --

    The Company's international operations include subsidiaries, joint ventures,
licensees and  other  affiliates  in  33  countries  on  six  continents.  These
operations  serve such markets  as automotive, beverage  and food, construction,
general industrial, packaging  and others  on a worldwide  basis. The  Company's
wholly  and majority-owned international  subsidiaries contributed approximately
36% and 45% of operating revenues in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Refer to pages 20 and 21 in the Company's 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders
for additional information on international activities. International operations
are subject to certain risks inherent in


conducting business  in foreign  countries, including  price controls,  exchange
controls,  limitations on  participation in  local enterprises, nationalization,
expropriation and other  governmental action, and  changes in currency  exchange
rates.

    EXECUTIVE OFFICERS --

    Executive Officers of the Company as of March 8, 1994 are as follows:



    Except  for Messrs.  Hudnut and Karpan,  each of the  foregoing officers has
been employed by the Company in various executive capacities for more than  five
years.  The executive officers of the Company serve at the pleasure of the Board
of Directors. Mr. Hudnut  joined the Company in  January 1992 having  previously
served  as Senior Vice President, General Counsel  and Secretary of MBIA Inc., a
financial guarantor,  and  Vice  President, General  Counsel  and  Secretary  of
Scovill  Inc., a diversified manufacturer. Mr. Karpan joined the Company in June
1990 having previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Butler
Fixture Company,  a manufacturer  of commercial  fixtures, and  Vice  President,
Human  Resources and Planning for Borg  Warner Automotive, Inc., manufacturer of
automotive components. Mr. Smith has  entered into a one-year service  agreement
with the Company for $85,000.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    As  of  December  31,  1993  the  Company  operated  160  plants  and office
facilities in the United States, excluding regional sales offices and  warehouse
facilities.  Of the  total U.S.  floor space  of 11.1  million square  feet, 7.5
million is owned by  the Company, with the  remaining 3.6 million being  leased.
Internationally,  the Company operated 87 plants and office facilities excluding
regional sales  offices and  warehouse facilities.  Of the  total  international
floor  space of 5.1  million square feet,  3.6 million is  owned by the Company,
with the remaining 1.5 million being leased. The principal international  plants
are  in  Australia, Belgium,  Brazil, Canada,  France, Germany,  Ireland, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

    Of the  worldwide  plants  and  office  facilities,  122  were  operated  by
businesses  in  the  Engineered Components  segment,  119 by  businesses  in the
Industrial Systems and Consumables segment, and 6 by corporate-related entities.
Of the company-wide square  footage, 7.5 million are  used by businesses in  the
Engineered  Components segment  and 7.6  million are  used by  businesses in the
Industrial Systems and  Consumables segment, with  the remaining square  footage
used as corporate-related facilities.

    The   Company's  properties  are  primarily  of  steel,  brick  or  concrete
construction  and  are  maintained  in  good  operating  condition.   Productive
capacity,  in general, currently  exceeds operating levels.  Capacity levels are
somewhat flexible based on the  number of shifts operated  and on the number  of
overtime hours worked. The Company adds productive capacity from time to time as
required  by  increased  demand. Additions  to  capacity  can be  made  within a
reasonable period of time due to the nature of the businesses.
