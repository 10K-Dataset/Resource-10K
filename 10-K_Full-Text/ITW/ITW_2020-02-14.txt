The ITW Business Model

The powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. The ITW Business Model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders. It is comprised of three unique elements:

•

ITW’s

80/20 Front-to-Back

process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;

•

Customer-back Innovation

has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 18,000 granted and pending patents;


•

ITW’s

Decentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture

enables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.

Enterprise Strategy

In late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. The Company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.

ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. To shift its primary growth engine to organic, the Company began executing a multi-step approach.

•

The first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of ITW's business portfolio. As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.

As a result of this work, ITW's business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. The Company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses' largest / most profitable customers and product lines.

•

Step two, Business Structure Simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale up ITW’s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.

•

The Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2019 and continues to be a key contributor to the Company's ongoing enterprise strategy.

•

With the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.

ITW has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.

Path to Full Potential - Finishing the Job

Since the launch of the enterprise strategy, the Company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential. The ITW Business Model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage, but for the Company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential, every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential. To do so, the Company remains focused on its core principles to position ITW to perform to its full potential:

•

Portfolio discipline

•

80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence

•

Full-potential organic growth


Portfolio Discipline

The Company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the ITW Business Model. ITW businesses have the right “raw material” in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the ITW Business Model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.

The Company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value ITW's differentiated products, services and solutions. ITW’s portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the Company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.

As part of its agenda to finish the job, the Company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. This includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement ITW’s long-term growth potential.

The Company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses. The Company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be offset by incremental share repurchases. Refer to Note 2. Divestitures in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding divestitures.

80/20 Front-to-Back Practice Excellence

The 80/20 Front-to-Back process is a rigorous, iterative and highly data-driven approach to identify where the Company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable, high-quality organic growth. The Company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities, markets, customers, and products.

ITW will continue its efforts to finish the job and drive 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence in every division in the Company, every day. Driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 Front-to-Back practice across the Company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of the Company's divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.

Full-Potential Organic Growth

Reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable, high-quality organic growth. The Company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the ITW Business Model to achieve full-potential organic growth in every division, with specific focus on:

•

"80” focused Market Penetration - fully leveraging the considerable growth potential that resides in the Company's largest and most differentiated product offerings and customer relationships

•

Customer-Back Innovation - strengthening the Company's commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers

•

Strategic Sales Excellence - deploying a high-performance sales function in every division

As the Company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the Company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of ITW through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions.

Current Year Developments

Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Distribution Methods

The Company’s businesses primarily distribute their products directly to industrial manufacturers and through independent distributors.


Backlog

Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of their products. Total backlog was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. Due to the predominately short-term nature of the Company's arrangements with its customers, backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year


were not material as of

December 31, 2019

.

Competition

With operations in


countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the Welding segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and ESAB.

In virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference and service delivery. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments. The Company believes that each segment's primary competitive advantages derive from the Company's business model and decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Automotive OEM segment.

Raw Materials

The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins and chemicals, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns approximately 3,600 unexpired U.S. patents and 8,700 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,500 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,300 applications pending in foreign patent offices. There is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains a patent group for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.

The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company's patents would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.

In addition to patents, many of the Company's products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the Company's businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Automotive OEM segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment; Instron in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment; Miller in the Welding segment; Rain-X and Permatex in the Polymers & Fluids segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Hi-Cone in the Specialty Products segment.

Environmental

The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

The Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.

The Company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Slower economic growth, financial market instability, natural disasters, public health crises, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the Company serves can adversely affect the Company’s businesses by reducing demand for the Company's products and services, limiting financing available to the Company's customers, causing production delays, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the Company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.

The global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.

Over 50% of the Company's net sales are derived from customers outside the United States, and the Company currently operates in


countries. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include:

•

fluctuation in currency exchange rates;

•

limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;

•

price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;

•

transportation delays and interruptions;

•

political, social and economic instability and disruptions;

•

acts of terrorism;


•

the impact of widespread public health crises;

•

government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;

•

the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;

•

government actions impacting international trade agreements;

•

import and export controls;

•

labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;

•

the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;

•

limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.

The current global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. Further changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and additional retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. Additionally, in early 2020, an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred in China and other jurisdictions. The extent of the outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the Company and on its operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could interrupt the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers. If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.

The benefits from the Company’s Enterprise Strategy may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the Company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.

As the Company continues to execute on its Enterprise Strategy initiatives, it remains focused on the core principles of portfolio discipline, 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence, and organic growth. Product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the Company’s 80/20 Front-to-Back process, continue to be applied by the Company’s operating divisions and are active elements of the Enterprise Strategy. Although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the Company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term. Additionally, other core activities of the Enterprise Strategy related to portfolio discipline and organic growth, including customer-back innovation and strategic sales excellence, may not have the desired impact on future operating results. If the Company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its Enterprise Strategy initiatives, the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the Company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.

The timing and amount of the Company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.

Share repurchases constitute a significant component of the Company’s capital allocation strategy. The Company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the Company from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of U.S. cash.

The Company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws.

The Company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the Company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. The Company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. Any such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the Company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.


A significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's operating income.

Although the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Company's profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.

If the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected.

The Company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company's competitive position. If the Company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.

If the Company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.

Protecting the Company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. The Company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company's competitive position and results of operations.

The Company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.

The Company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company's profitability and returns:

•

The acquired business could under-perform relative to the Company’s expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company’s anticipated timetable.

•

The acquired business could cause the Company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.

•

Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.

•

The acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the Company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.

•

The Company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the Company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations.

•

As a result of acquisitions, the Company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. If the Company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets.

Divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the Company's financial results.

The Company had significant divestiture activity in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative, and it divested additional businesses in 2019 as it continues portfolio refinements to maintain portfolio discipline. The Company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, which could adversely affect the Company's financial results.


The Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.

The Company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. Impairment charges could adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.

Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the Company's credit ratings could increase the Company's funding costs or reduce the availability of credit.

Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. The Company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. In addition, the Company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. If conditions in the financial markets decline or the Company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished.

Raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.

The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and profit margins. In particular, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs, potential retaliatory countermeasures and severe weather events could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.

In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation that included significant changes to the taxation of business entities. The Company’s accounting for the tax effects of the Act may be subject to change due to subsequent clarification of the tax law which could adversely affect the Company's operating results or financial condition.

The Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.

The performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.

Potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results.

The Company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.


Uncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact the Company's results of operations and financial position.

Increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. These regulations or standards could mandate even more restrictive requirements, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions and production of single use plastics, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, or the Company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.

If the Company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if there is a violation of data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.

The Company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; attacks by computer hackers; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. We are also subject to data privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, in the various countries in which we operate. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, or if we violate data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.

ITEM 2.

Properties

Due to the Company’s decentralized operating structure and global operations, the Company operates out of a number of facilities worldwide, none of which are individually significant to the Company or its segments. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company operated approximately 440 plants and office facilities, excluding regional sales offices and warehouse facilities. Approximately 280 of the facilities were located outside of the United States. Principal foreign countries include China, Germany, the United Kingdom and France.

The Company’s properties are well suited for the purposes for which they were designed and are maintained in good operating condition. Production capacity, in general, currently exceeds operating levels. Capacity levels are somewhat flexible based on the number of shifts operated and on the number of overtime hours worked. The Company adds production capacity from time to time as required by increased demand.

ITEM 6.

Selected Financial Data

In 2017, the Company recorded a one-time additional income tax expense of $658 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the United States "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act." Refer to Note 6. Income Taxes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.

Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year reporting, including the adoption of new accounting guidance as discussed below.

In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that included several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. Among the more significant changes, the new guidance requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards after adoption of the guidance be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. Additionally, the income tax effects related to excess tax benefits should be presented within operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. Excess tax benefits recognized in equity under the prior guidance were $29 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2017 and applied the new guidance prospectively. Excess tax benefits of $28 million, $10 million and $50 million were included in Income taxes in the statement of income for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and 2017, respectively. The expected effect on income tax expense or net cash provided from operating activities related to future stock-based award settlements will vary each period and will depend on inputs such as the stock price at the time of settlement and the number of awards settled in the period presented.

Additional information on the comparability of results is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


ITEM 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with


divisions in


countries. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company employed approximately

45,000

people.

The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers & Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.

Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.

THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL

The powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company’s core source of value creation. The ITW Business Model is the Company’s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders. It is comprised of three unique elements:

•

ITW’s

80/20 Front-to-Back

process is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company and its customers. Through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the “20”). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;

•

Customer-back Innovation

has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company’s unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 Front-to-Back process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their “80” customers. ITW’s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in “80” markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 18,000 granted and pending patents;

•

ITW’s

Decentralized, Entrepreneurial Culture

enables ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. ITW colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the Company's strategy and values. As a result, the Company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.

ENTERPRISE STRATEGY

In late 2012, ITW began its strategic framework transitioning the Company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. The Company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.


ITW determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. To shift its primary growth engine to organic, the Company began executing a multi-step approach.

•

The first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of ITW's business portfolio. As part of the Portfolio Management initiative, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions.

As a result of this work, ITW's business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. The Company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses' largest / most profitable customers and product lines.

•

Step two, Business Structure Simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale up ITW’s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.

•

The Strategic Sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at ITW, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2019 and continues to be a key contributor to the Company's ongoing enterprise strategy.

•

With the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 Front-to-Back process to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.

ITW has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company’s operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. At the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.

PATH TO FULL POTENTIAL - FINISHING THE JOB

Since the launch of the enterprise strategy, the Company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential. The ITW Business Model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage, but for the Company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential, every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential. To do so, the Company remains focused on its core principles to position ITW to perform to its full potential:

•

Portfolio discipline

•

80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence

•

Full-potential organic growth

Portfolio Discipline

The Company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the ITW Business Model. ITW businesses have the right “raw material” in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the ITW Business Model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.

The Company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value ITW's differentiated products, services and solutions. ITW’s portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the Company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.

As part of its agenda to finish the job, the Company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. This includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement ITW’s long-term growth potential.


The Company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses. The Company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be offset by incremental share repurchases. Refer to Note 2. Divestitures in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding divestitures.

80/20 Front-to-Back Practice Excellence

The 80/20 Front-to-Back process is a rigorous, iterative and highly data-driven approach to identify where the Company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable, high-quality organic growth. The Company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities, markets, customers, and products.

ITW will continue its efforts to finish the job and drive 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence in every division in the Company, every day. Driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 Front-to-Back practice across the Company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of the Company's divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.

Full-potential Organic Growth

Reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable, high-quality organic growth. The Company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the ITW Business Model to achieve full-potential organic growth in every division, with specific focus on:

•

"80” focused Market Penetration - fully leveraging the considerable growth potential that resides in the Company's largest and most differentiated product offerings and customer relationships

•

Customer-Back Innovation - strengthening the Company's commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers

•

Strategic Sales Excellence - deploying a high-performance sales function in every division

As the Company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the Company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of ITW through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions.

TERMS USED BY ITW

Management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company:

•

Organic business

- acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis.

•

Operating leverage

- the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period.

•

Price/cost

-

represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers.

•

Product line simplification (PLS)

- focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.

Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company delivered solid financial results in 2019 despite a contracting industrial demand environment. With the Company's diversified high-quality business portfolio, highly differentiated ITW Business Model and continued strong execution on enterprise initiatives throughout the year, the Company grew diluted earnings per share and returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2019. Additionally, all segments had operating margin at or above 21.5% for 2019.


The Company does not believe that tariffs imposed in the past year have had a material impact on its operating results. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of enacted and proposed tariffs on its businesses, as well as pricing actions to mitigate the impact of any raw material cost increases resulting from these tariffs.

In early 2020, an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred in China and other jurisdictions. The extent of the outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the Company and on its operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could interrupt the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers.

The Company presents certain financial measures in fiscal year 2017 excluding the $658 million tax charge related to the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and the benefit of a favorable $95 million legal settlement. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company's operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company's financial results and overall performance to that of its peers.

The Company’s consolidated results of operations for


,


and


were as follows:


compared to


•

Operating revenue declined due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, lower organic revenue and divestitures.

•

Organic revenue decreased 1.9% primarily driven by a decline in the Automotive OEM, Specialty Products, Welding and Construction Products segments. Product line simplification activities reduced organic revenue by 60 basis points.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT

The reconciliation of segment operating revenue and operating income to total operating revenue and operating income is as follows:

Segments are allocated a fixed overhead charge based on the segment's revenue. Expenses not charged to the segments are reported separately as Unallocated. Because the Unallocated category includes a variety of items, it is subject to fluctuations on a quarterly and annual basis. Unallocated in 2017 includes the favorable impact from the previously discussed confidential legal settlement.

AUTOMOTIVE OEM

This segment is a global, niche supplier to top tier OEMs, providing unique innovation to address pain points for sophisticated customers with complex problems. Businesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications. This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers market.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had

$2.0 billion

of cash and equivalents on hand as of

December 31, 2019

and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:

•

internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses;

•

payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and

•

external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the Company's organic growth focus and an active share repurchase program.

The Company believes that, based on its operating revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing, if necessary.


Cash Flow

The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Summarized cash flow information for the years ended December 31,


,


and


was as follows:

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of an additional $115 million discretionary pension contribution related to the U.S. primary pension plan.

Stock Repurchase Programs

On February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the repurchase of up to

$6.0 billion

of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2015 Program"). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately

6.1 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$91.78

per share during 2015, approximately

18.7 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$107.17

per share during 2016, approximately

7.1 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$140.56

per share during 2017, approximately

13.9 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$143.66

per share during 2018 and approximately

3.1 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$143.23

per share during 2019. The 2015 Program was completed in the second quarter of 2019.

On August 3, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the repurchase of up to an additional

$3.0 billion

of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2018 Program"). Under the 2018 Program, the Company repurchased approximately

6.7 million

shares of its common stock at an average price of

$158.11

per share during 2019. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were approximately

$1.9 billion

of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2018 program.


Adjusted After-Tax Return on Average Invested Capital

The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the third quarter discrete tax benefit of $21 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company excluded the third quarter net discrete tax benefit of $15 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company also excluded the $658 million income tax charge from the effective tax rate and the $95 million confidential legal settlement from the calculation of ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2017. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. ROIC for the years ended December 31,


,


, and


was as follows:

ROIC increased 50 basis points for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 5.3% decrease in average invested capital versus a 3.9% decrease in after-tax operating income. ROIC increased 390 basis points in


versus


primarily related to the new U.S. tax rules and regulations.

A reconciliation of the 2019 effective tax rate excluding the third quarter discrete tax benefit of $21 million is as follows:


A reconciliation of the 2018 effective tax rate excluding the third quarter net discrete tax benefit of $15 million is as follows:

A reconciliation of the 2017 effective tax rate excluding the discrete tax charge of $658 million related to the 2017 U.S. tax legislation is as follows:

Refer to Note 6. Income Taxes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding the discrete tax items noted above.

Working Capital

Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of December 31,


and


is summarized as follows:

The increase in net working capital as of

December 31, 2019

was primarily driven by lower short-term debt. See Note 10. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.

As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately half of the Company's cash and equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash and equivalents held internationally are typically used for international operating needs or reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses. International funds may also be used to fund international acquisitions or, if not considered


permanently invested, may be repatriated to the U.S. The Company has accrued for foreign withholding taxes related to foreign held cash and equivalents that are not permanently invested.

In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from operations to fund domestic cash needs and the Company's capital allocation priorities. This includes operating needs of the U.S. businesses, dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations, reinvesting to fund expansion of existing U.S. businesses and general corporate needs. The Company may also use its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated by operations and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.

Debt

Total debt as of December 31,


and


was as follows:

As of

December 31, 2019

, short-term debt included

$4 million

related to the

$2.5 billion

,

five

-year line of credit agreement with a termination date of September 27, 2024 to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. This agreement replaced the existing

$2.5 billion

line of credit agreement with a termination date of May 9, 2021.

Euro notes due June 5, 2031 at

98.982%

of face value. Net proceeds from the issuances were used to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.


Total Debt to EBITDA

The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. Total debt to EBITDA for the years ended December 31,

December 31, 2019

.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company has three accounting policies that it believes are most important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. Various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The Company's critical accounting policies are as follows:

Income Taxes

—

The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

—

The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $

5.3 billion

allocated to its reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Company’s 80/20 Front-to-Back process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $167 million to $1.2 billion, with the average amount equal to $533 million. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Company’s global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

—

The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. Pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. Future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Note 11. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.


The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $41 million. The Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. See Note 11. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.

The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $4 million.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of its ongoing business operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for details related to the fair value of the Company's debt instruments.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company operates in the U.S. and


foreign countries. The funding for the foreign manufacturing operations is provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital. The Company’s products are typically manufactured and sold within the same country or economic union. Therefore, the Company's manufacturing operations generally do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.

The Company designated the €

1.0 billion

of Euro notes issued in May 2014, the €

1.0 billion

of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the €

1.6 billion

of Euro notes issued in June 2019 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative unrealized pre-tax gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was

$239 million

and

$187 million

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). ITW’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

ITW management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we believe that, as of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Income Taxes-Refer to Note 6 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s income tax expense is recognized and measured based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions, which requires significant judgment. When calculating income tax expense management makes estimates and assumptions, including determination of the completeness of book income in each jurisdiction, calculation of taxable income through identification and classification of book to tax differences (either temporary or permanent items), consideration of applicable tax deductions or credits, and the identification of uncertain tax positions.

The evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill and knowledge related to the identified position. Management evaluates uncertain tax positions identified and a liability is established for unrecognized tax benefits when there is a more than 50% likelihood that its tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There is additional judgment to determine the amount of the liability for the underlying tax position. The Company’s income tax expense for 2019 was $767 million and the liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019, was $296 million.

Given the number of taxing jurisdictions and the complex and subjective nature of the associated tax regulations and rulings, certain audit matters required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists. These matters included the auditing of income tax expense, identification of uncertain tax positions, measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, and certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

With the assistance of our income tax specialists, our principal audit procedures related to income tax expense included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over income taxes, including those over income tax expense, unrecognized tax benefits, and certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications.

•

We evaluated management’s significant estimates and judgments incorporated into the calculation of income tax expense by:

•

Selecting a sample of book to tax differences (temporary and permanent) and testing the accuracy, completeness, and classification of the selections, including evaluating that all impacts of significant transactions with income tax expense implications are considered.

•

Developing an expectation over the foreign income tax expense by jurisdiction and comparing it to the recorded balance.

•

Testing the accuracy of the income tax expense calculation.

•

We evaluated management’s significant judgments regarding the identification of uncertain tax positions by:

•

Evaluating the reasonableness of a selection of certain planning transactions with income tax expense implications, including the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the transactions.

•

Assessing management’s methods and assumptions used in identifying uncertain tax positions.

•

Comparing results of prior tax audits to ongoing and anticipated tax audits by tax authorities.

•

Evaluating external information, including applicable tax law, new interpretations, and related changes to assess the completeness and reasonableness of management’s considerations.

•

Determining if there was additional information not considered in management’s assessment.

•

We evaluated a sample of the liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits to assess the establishment and amount of the liability for the specific underlying tax position.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of business

— Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately


divisions in


countries.

The Company primarily serves the automotive OEM/tiers, commercial food equipment, construction, general industrial, and automotive aftermarket end markets.

Consolidation and translation

— The financial statements include the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company follows the equity method of accounting for investments where the Company has a significant influence but not a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated from the financial statements. Foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Reclassifications

— Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year reporting.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Acquisitions

— The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired companies are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Operating revenue

— Prior to 2018, the Company recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product had shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership had transferred or services had been rendered, the price to the customer was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured, which generally occurred at the time of product shipment. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new revenue recognition guidance. Under this new guidance, operating revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer and the customer obtains control of that good or receives the service performed. The Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominantly short-term in nature involving a single performance obligation related to the delivery of products and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment. In limited circumstances, arrangements may include service performed over time, or there may be significant obligations to the customer that are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance. In these circumstances, operating revenue may be recognized over time as the service is provided to the customer or deferred until all significant obligations have been completed. The amount of operating revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services and may include adjustments for customer allowances and rebates. Customer allowances and rebates consist primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, which are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and anticipated trends. Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenue and are recognized along with the related product revenue as they are considered a fulfillment cost. Sales commissions are expensed when incurred, which is generally at the time of revenue recognition.

Contract liabilities associated with sales arrangements primarily relate to deferred revenue on equipment sales and prepaid service contracts. Total deferred revenue and customer deposits were

$


million

and

$


million

as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are short-term in nature. For additional information regarding the Company's operating revenue, see New Accounting Pronouncements below and Note 3. Operating Revenue.

Research and development expenses

— Research and development expenses are recorded as expense in the year incurred.

These costs were

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

Advertising expenses

— Advertising expenses are recorded as expense in the year incurred.

These costs were

$


million

,

$


million and

$


million for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

Income taxes

— The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and


liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Cash and equivalents

— Cash and equivalents include cash on hand and instruments having original maturities of three months or less. Cash and equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Trade receivables

— Trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Prior to 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts included reserves for uncollectible accounts and customer credits. Under the new revenue guidance adopted on January 1, 2018, the reserve for customer credits is reported as a liability and included in Accrued expenses in the Statement of Financial Position. Accordingly, after January 1, 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was comprised of reserves for uncollectible accounts.

The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31,


,


and


were as follows:

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and include material, labor and factory overhead. The last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method is used to determine the cost of inventories at certain U.S. businesses. The first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, which approximates current cost, is used for all other inventories.

Inventories priced at LIFO were approximately


%

of total inventories as of December 31,


and


. If the FIFO method was used for all inventories, total inventories would have been approximately

$


million

and

$


million

higher than reported at December 31,


and


, respectively.

The major classes of inventory at December 31,


and


were as follows:

Net plant and equipment

— Net plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of plant and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

Net plant and equipment consisted of the following at December 31,


and


:


The Company’s U.S. businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis. The majority of the Company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis.

The ranges of useful lives used to depreciate plant and equipment are as follows:

Depreciation was

$


million,

$


million and

$


million for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of


to


years.

The Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur, based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.

When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various Level 2 and Level 3 valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit and market multiples of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill.

The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a Level 3 valuation method using a relief-from-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.

Accrued warranties

— The Company accrues for product warranties based on historical experience.

The changes in accrued warranties for the years ended December 31,


,


and


were as follows:

New Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2018

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, expanded revenue disclosures are required. The Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominantly short-term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control and risks and rewards of ownership at the time of product shipment or delivery of service. As such, the timing of revenue recognition under both the prior and new guidance is the same for the majority of the Company’s transactions. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance under the modified retrospective method and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing retained earnings by

$


million

as of January 1, 2018. Under the modified


retrospective method of adoption, prior periods are not restated and the new guidance is applied prospectively to revenue transactions completed on or after January 1, 2018. Given the nature of the Company’s revenue transactions, the new guidance had an immaterial impact on the Company's operating revenue, results of operations, and financial position for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company updated its revenue recognition accounting policy to reflect the requirements of the new guidance and included additional disclosures regarding the Company's revenue transactions. Refer to the Company’s operating revenue accounting policy above and Note 3. Operating Revenue for additional information.

In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the prior guidance. The provisions of the new guidance are being applied prospectively to intra-entity asset transfers on or after January 1, 2018 and may result in future tax rate volatility. Upon adoption of the new guidance on January 1, 2018, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing deferred tax assets and retained earnings by

$


million

. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the impact of the new guidance on the Company's effective income tax rate was not material.

In February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows for an optional one-time reclassification of the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Act") from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") to retained earnings. The guidance was effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2018 and to reclassify the stranded tax effects related to the Act, which resulted in an increase of

$


million

to both retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders' Equity for additional information.

Effective January 1, 2019

In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. The primary change under the new guidance is that a lessee is required to recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for its operating leases. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new guidance prospectively for all operating lease transactions as of and after the effective date with a noncancellable lease term greater than one year. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a lease liability of

$


million

and a corresponding right-of-use asset. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 9. Leases for additional information regarding the Company’s lease transactions.

In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which included targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve financial reporting of hedging activities. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new guidance which did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Effective January 1, 2020

In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the methodology used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments. Under current guidance, credit loss reserves are estimated based on historical information. The new guidance requires credit loss reserves to reflect the estimated credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. This new guidance is effective for the Company prospectively beginning January 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which simplifies the assessment of goodwill for impairment. Under current guidance, when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the goodwill must be determined by valuing the other assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Under the new guidance, the requirement to determine the fair value of goodwill has been eliminated, and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

This new guidance is effective for the Company prospectively beginning January 1, 2020

and will be applied by the Company during its annual assessment of goodwill in the third quarter, or earlier if a triggering event occurs. The adoption of this new accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

Divestitures

The Company routinely reviews its portfolio of businesses relative to its business portfolio criteria and evaluates if further portfolio refinements may be needed. The Company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with annual revenues totaling up to

$


billion

. As such, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as held for sale in periods prior to the sale of the business.

In the second quarter of 2019, the Company approved plans to divest

six

businesses, including

two

businesses in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment,

Prior to 2018, the Company recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product had shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership had transferred or services had been rendered, the price to the customer was fixed or determinable, and collectability was reasonably assured, which generally occurred at the time of product shipment. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new revenue recognition guidance. Under this new guidance, operating revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer and the customer obtains control of that good or receives the service performed. Given the nature of the Company’s revenue transactions, the new guidance had an immaterial impact on the Company's operating revenue, results of operations, and financial position for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. The following is a description of the product offerings, end markets and typical revenue transactions for each of the Company's

seven

segments:

Automotive OEM

—

This segment is a global, niche supplier to top tier OEMs, providing unique innovation to address pain points for sophisticated customers with complex problems. Businesses in this segment produce components and fasteners for automotive-related applications. This segment primarily serves the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers market. Products in this segment include:

plastic and metal components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles, light trucks and other industrial uses.

Products sold in this segment are primarily manufactured to the customer's specifications and are sold under long-term supply agreements with OEM auto manufacturers and other top tier auto parts suppliers. The Company typically recognizes revenue for products in this segment at the time of shipment. Certain products may be produced utilizing tooling that is owned by the customer that the Company developed and is reimbursed by the customer for the associated cost. In these arrangements, the Company typically retains a contractual right to use the customer-owned tooling for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the supply agreement. The Company records reimbursements for the cost of customer-owned tooling as a cost offset rather than operating revenue as tooling is not considered a product offering central to the Company's operations.

Legal Settlement

In the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a

$


million

confidential settlement agreement to resolve a litigation matter. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Company received the settlement within


days of the execution of the agreement. The receipt of the settlement resulted in a favorable pre-tax impact of

$


million

in the second quarter of 2017 and

$


million

in the third quarter of 2017, which were included in operating income.

(5)

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following:

Refer to Note 2. Divestitures for further information regarding the Gain (loss) on disposal of operations and affiliates of

$


million

for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company divested a


%

majority interest in its former Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R"). As a result of the transaction, the Company owns common units (the "Common Units") of Wilsonart International Holdings LLC ("Wilsonart") initially representing approximately


%

(on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity. CD&R owns cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the "Preferred Units") of Wilsonart representing approximately


%

(on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity. The Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference, and accrue dividends at a rate of


%

per annum. The ownership interest in Wilsonart is reported using the equity


method of accounting. The Company's proportionate share in income (loss) of Wilsonart is reported in Other income (expense) in the Statement of Income. As the Company's investment in Wilsonart is structured as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, U.S. taxes are recorded separately from the equity investment. In 2016, the Company received a

$


million

dividend distribution from Wilsonart which exceeded the Company's equity investment balance and resulted in a

$


million

pre-tax gain in 2016. As a result of the dividend distribution, the equity investment balance in Wilsonart was reduced to

zero

and any subsequent equity investment income will not be recognized until the gain is recaptured.

(6)

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the “Act”) was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax rules. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time additional income tax expense of

$


million

related to the enactment of the Act. The more significant tax law changes resulting from the Act and related impacts to the Company are as follows:

•

A one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

As a result of this one-time deemed repatriation, the Company recorded a one-time additional income tax expense of

$


million

during the fourth quarter of 2017. A portion of the resulting income taxes payable can be paid in installments over eight years. The noncurrent income taxes payable related to the one-time repatriation tax was

$


million

and

$


million

as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, as a result of the one-time repatriation provisions of the Act, the Company recorded additional foreign withholding taxes of

$


million

in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the expected repatriation of foreign held cash and equivalents.

•

A reduction in the U.S. corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of

35%

to a flat rate of

21%

beginning in 2018.

Although the lower tax rate took effect in 2018, deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply in the years in which they are expected to be settled. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time net income tax benefit of

$


million

as a result of the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the impact of lower future U.S. corporate tax rates.

•

Deductibility of certain executive compensation.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time write-off of deferred tax assets of

$


million

related to the non-deductibility of certain performance-based compensation.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act; however, the Company made a reasonable estimate which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company revised its initial estimates which did not result in material changes to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, or the effective tax rate for 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting related to the tax effects of enactment of the Act. The Company’s ongoing accounting for the tax effects of the Act are based on the Company's current understanding of the changes in the tax law under the Act, but may be impacted due to issuance of final regulations or further clarification of the tax law.


Provision for income taxes

—

The components of the provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

December 31, 2019

,


and


was

23.3

%

,

24.5

%

and

48.4

%

, respectively. The 2019 and 2018 effective tax rates benefited from the lower U.S. corporate federal tax rate and discrete items. The 2019 effective tax rate benefited from a discrete tax benefit of

$


million

in the third quarter for the U.S. federal provision to return adjustment resulting primarily from changes in estimates related to the Act. The 2018 effective tax rate benefited from a discrete tax benefit of

$


million

in the third quarter related to the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary, which was partially offset by a discrete tax charge of

$


million

in the third quarter related to foreign tax credits. Included in the effective tax rate for 2017 was a one-time additional income tax expense of

$


million

related to the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the effective tax rates for


,



and


included

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Prior to the Act, deferred U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes had not been provided on substantially all undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as these earnings were considered permanently invested. As part of the one-time deemed repatriation provisions of the Act, the Company provided for U.S. tax on substantially all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. Upon repatriation of earnings to the U.S., the Company may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. The accrual for foreign withholding taxes related to the expected repatriation of foreign held cash and equivalents as of

December 31, 2019

and


was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Deferred foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings considered permanently invested. As of

December 31, 2019

, undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested were approximately

$

5.7

billion

. Determination of the related deferred tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities

—

The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31,


and


were as follows:

The valuation allowances recorded as of December 31,


and


related primarily to certain net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. As of

Unrecognized tax benefit

s—

The changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the twelve months ended December 31,


,


and


were as follows:

Included in the balance as of December 31,


were approximately

$


million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

Settlements during 2017 primarily related to the Company effectively settling with the German Fiscal Authority on issues identified during its 2009-2011 audit, which primarily related to intercompany transactions.

The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately

$


million

related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues.

The following table summarizes the open tax years for the Company’s major jurisdictions:

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The accrual for interest and penalties as of December 31,


and


was

$


million and

$


million

, respectively.

Net Income Per Share

Net income per basic share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Net income per diluted share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares assuming dilution for stock options and restricted stock units. Dilutive shares reflect the potential additional shares that would be outstanding if the dilutive stock options outstanding were exercised and the unvested restricted stock units vested during the period.

The computation of net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

Options that were considered antidilutive were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share. There were

0.9

million

and

0.5

million

antidilutive options outstanding as of

(9)

Leases

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new lease accounting guidance which requires the recognition of a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for all operating leases with a noncancellable lease term of greater than one year. The new guidance did not change the recognition of rental expense for operating leases which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable lease term based on the minimum lease payments at lease inception. Changes in rent subsequent to commencement that were not included in minimum lease payments at inception are recognized as variable rent in the period incurred.

The Company’s lease transactions are primarily for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment under operating lease arrangements. Total rental expense for operating leases for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, predominately in the U.S. The U.S. primary pension plan provides benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The U.S. primary postretirement health care plan is contributory with the participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The U.S. primary postretirement life insurance plan is noncontributory. Beginning January 1, 2007, the U.S. primary pension and other postretirement benefit plans were closed to new participants. Newly hired employees and employees from acquired businesses that are not participating in these plans are eligible for additional Company contributions under the existing U.S. primary defined contribution retirement plans. The Company’s expense related to defined contribution plans was

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


, and $


million in


. In addition to the U.S. plans, the Company also has defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries, mainly the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Switzerland.


Summarized information regarding net periodic benefit cost included in the Statement of Income related to the Company's significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented within Cost of revenue and Selling, administrative, and research and development expenses in the Statement of Income while the other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented within Other income (expense).

The Company used the updated mortality improvement scales from the Society of Actuaries, MP-2019 and MP-2018, to measure its U.S. pension and other postretirement obligations as of December 31,


and


, respectively, which did not have a significant impact in either period.

The following tables provide a rollforward of the plan benefit obligations, plan assets and a reconciliation of funded status for the twelve months ended December 31,


and


:


Assumptions

—

The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuations of pension and other postretirement benefits were as follows:

The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefit plans were developed using historical asset class returns while factoring in current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and asset class performance.

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar


duration to the liabilities in the plan. The Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care benefit plans.

The assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31 were as follows:

A one percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following impact:

Plan assets

— The Company’s overall investment strategy for the assets in the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of growing plan assets and keeping risk at a reasonable level over a long-term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset classes, securities and investment managers. The target allocations for plan assets are


%

to


%

equity investments,


%

to


%

fixed income investments and


%

to


%

in other types of investments. The Company does not use derivatives for the purpose of speculation, leverage, circumventing investment guidelines or taking risks that are inconsistent with specified guidelines.

The assets in the Company’s postretirement health care plan are primarily invested in life insurance policies. The Company’s overall investment strategy for the assets in the postretirement health care fund is to invest in assets that provide a reasonable tax exempt rate of return while preserving capital.


The following tables present the fair value of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31,


and


, by asset category and valuation methodology. Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would be expected to use in pricing the assets. Each financial instrument’s categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Cash and equivalents include cash on hand and instruments with original maturities of

three months or less

and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fixed income securities primarily consist of U.S. and foreign government bills, notes and bonds, corporate debt securities and investment contracts. The majority of the assets in this category are valued by evaluating bid prices provided by independent financial data services. For securities where market data is not readily available,


unobservable market data is used to value the security. The underlying investments include small-cap equity, international equity and long- and short-term fixed income instruments.

Pension assets measured at net asset value include collective trust funds, partnerships/private equity interests and life insurance policies. Collective trust funds are private funds that are valued based on the value of the underlying investments which can be redeemed on a daily basis. The underlying investments include both passively and actively managed U.S. and foreign large- and mid-cap equity funds and short-term investment funds. Partnerships/private equity interests are investments in partnerships where the benefit plan is a limited partner. The investments are valued by the investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use market, income and cost valuation methods. Distributions are received from these funds on a periodic basis through the liquidation of the underlying assets of the fund. Life insurance policies are used to fund other postretirement benefits in order to obtain favorable tax treatment and are valued based on the cash surrender value of the underlying policies. The Company has selected the funds in which these assets are invested and may elect to withdraw funds with proper notice to the insurance company or maintain the policies and receive death benefits as determined by the contracts.

Cash flows

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including those involving environmental, product liability (including toxic tort) and general liability claims.

The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated.

Such accruals are based on developments to date, the Company’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters. The Company believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or future operations.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

—

The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during


,


and


were as follows:

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company elected to early adopt new accounting guidance related to the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the "Act") and reclassified

$


million

of stranded income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings. Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income primarily relate to the disposal of operations and were included in the related gain or loss upon disposal. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represent the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost. Refer to Note 11. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for the amounts included in net periodic benefit cost.

The Company designated the €

1.0

billion

of Euro notes issued in May 2014, the €

1.0

billion

of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the €

1.6

billion

of Euro notes issued in June 2019 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative unrealized pre-tax gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

As of December 31,


and


, the ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of after-tax cumulative translation adjustment losses of

$

1.3

billion

and

$

1.3

billion

, respectively, and after-tax unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The estimated pre-tax unrecognized net benefit cost that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income in


is $


million

for pension and other postretirement benefits.

Stock-Based Compensation

On May 8, 2015 (the "Effective Date"), the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") was approved by shareholders. As of the Effective Date, no additional awards will be granted to employees under the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan"). The significant terms of stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") were not changed under the 2015 Plan. Stock options and RSUs are issued to officers and/or other management employees under these plans. Stock options generally vest over a

four

-year period and have an expiration of

ten years

from the issuance date. RSUs generally "cliff" vest after a

three

-year period and include units with and without performance criteria. RSUs with performance criteria provide for full "cliff" vesting after

three years

if the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goals have been met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive

one

share of common stock of the Company for each vested RSU.

Commencing in February 2013, the Company began issuing shares from treasury stock to cover the exercised options and vested RSUs. Prior to February 2013, the Company generally issued new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. As of December 31,


, approximately


million

shares of ITW common stock were reserved for issuance under these plans.

The Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock awards over the remaining service periods of those awards.

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock-based compensation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

The following table summarizes activity related to non-vested RSUs for the twelve months ended December 31,


:

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the twelve months ended December 31,


:


The fair value of RSUs is equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of the grant. RSUs provide for dividend equivalents payable in additional RSUs for dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period. Stock option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures based on historical rates for awards with similar characteristics. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted.

The following summarizes the assumptions used in the option valuations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company’s stock and historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges presented result from separate groups of employees assumed to exhibit different exercise behavior.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted for the twelve months ended December 31,


,


and


was $

34.36

,

$

38.34

and

$

26.83

per share, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the twelve months ended December 31,


,


and


was $


million,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. As of December 31,
