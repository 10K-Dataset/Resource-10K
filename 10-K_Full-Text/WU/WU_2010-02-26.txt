ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

The Western Union Company (“Western Union” or the
    “Company”) is a leader in global money transfer and
    payment services, providing people and businesses with fast,
    reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments
    around the world.

The Western
    Union

®

brand is globally recognized and represents speed, reliability,
    trust and convenience. As people move and travel around the
    world, they are able to use the services of a well recognized
    brand to transfer funds. Our

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer service enables people to send money around the
    world in minutes. Our services are available through a network
    of over 410,000 agent locations in more than 200 countries and
    territories, with approximately 85% of those locations outside
    of the United States. Each location in our agent network is
    capable of providing one or more of our services, with the
    majority offering Western Union branded service. As of
    December 31, 2009, over 75% of our locations had
    experienced money transfer activity in the prior 12 months.

Our global business payments service provides consumers and
    businesses with flexible and convenient options for making
    one-time or recurring bill payments. In the third quarter of
    2009, we acquired Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom House”),
    a provider of international

business-to-business

cross-border, cross-currency payment services. Although most of
    the revenue in our global business payments segment is generated
    in the United States, we continue to expand our international
    presence and globally diversify our revenue, primarily through
    our acquisition of Custom House and our previous acquisition of
    Pago Fácil.

We believe that brand strength, size and reach of our global
    network, and convenience and reliability for our customers have
    been important factors relating to the growth of our business.
    As we continue to meet the needs of our customers for fast,
    reliable and convenient money transfer services, we are also
    working to enhance our services and provide our consumer and
    business clients with access to an expanding portfolio of
    payment and other financial services, including
    Visa

®

and
    Mastercard

®

prepaid debit card offerings.

The majority of our revenue comes from fees that consumers pay
    when they send money or make payments. In certain money transfer
    and payment services transactions involving different send and
    receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference
    between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business
    and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire
    currency.

Our
    Segments

We manage our business around the customers we serve and the
    type of services we offer. Each segment addresses a different
    combination of customer needs, distribution networks and
    services. Our segments are

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments. Our other businesses not included
    in these segments primarily consist of Western Union branded
    money order services available through a network of third-party
    agents primarily in the United States and Canada.

    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

See Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to
    our foreign operations.

Consumer-to-Consumer

Segment

Individual money transfers from one consumer to another are the
    core of our business, representing 85% of our total consolidated
    revenues for 2009. We offer consumers a variety of ways to send
    money. Although most remittances are sent in cash at one of our
    more than 410,000 agent locations worldwide, in some countries
    we offer the ability to send money over the internet or the
    telephone, using a credit or debit card, or through a withdrawal
    directly from a consumer’s bank account. Some agent
    locations accept debit cards to initiate a transaction. We also
    offer consumers several options to receive a money transfer.
    While the vast majority of transfers are paid in cash at agent
    locations, in some places we offer payout directly to the
    receiver’s bank account, to a stored-value card, to a
    mobile phone or through the issuance of a money order.

Operations

Our revenue is derived primarily from transaction fees charged
    to consumers to transfer money. In money transfers involving
    different send and receive currencies, we also generate revenue
    based on the difference between the exchange rate set by Western
    Union to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are
    able to acquire currency.

In a typical money transfer transaction, a consumer goes to one
    of our agent locations, completes a form specifying, among other
    things, the name and address of the recipient, and delivers it,
    along with the principal amount of the money transfer and the
    fee, to the agent. This sending agent enters the transaction
    information into our money transfer system and the funds are
    made available for payment, usually within minutes. The
    recipient enters an agent location in the designated receiving
    area or country, presents identification and is paid the
    transferred amount. Recipients do not pay a fee (although in
    limited circumstances, a tax may be imposed on the payment of
    the remittance). We determine the fee paid by the sender, which
    generally is based on the principal amount of the transaction
    and the locations to and from which the funds are sent and are
    to be transferred.

We generally pay our agents a commission based on a percentage
    of revenue. The commission is shared between the agent that
    initiated the transaction, the “send agent,” and the
    agent that paid the transaction, the “receive agent.”
    For most agents, the costs of providing the physical
    infrastructure and staff are typically covered by the
    agent’s primary business (e.g., postal services, banking,
    check cashing, travel and retail businesses), making the
    economics of being a Western Union agent attractive to our
    agents. Western Union’s global reach and loyal consumer
    base allow us to attract agents we believe to be of high quality.



To complement the convenience offered by our network’s
    global physical locations, in certain countries we have also
    made our services available through other channels, as described
    below under “Services.”

Over 85% of our

consumer-to-consumer

transactions involve at least one

non-United

States location. No individual country outside the United States
    accounted for more than approximately 6%, 7% and 7% of our
    consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Certain of our agents facilitate a
    large number of transactions; however, no individual agent
    accounted for greater than 10% of the segment’s revenue
    during these periods.

Services

We offer money transfer services worldwide. In 2009, over 95% of
    our

consumer-to-consumer

transactions were cash money transfers involving our walk-in
    agent locations around the world. Although demand for in-person,
    cash money transfers has historically been the strongest, we
    offer a number of options for sending and receiving funds that
    provide consumer convenience and choice to meet the needs of
    consumers. The different ways consumers can send or receive
    money include the following:

Walk-in money transfer service.

The majority of our
    remittances constitute transactions in which cash is collected
    by the agent and payment (usually cash) is available for

pick-up

at
    another agent location in the designated receive location,
    usually within minutes. In some United States outbound corridors
    and in select international corridors, we provide a “Direct
    to Bank” service, enabling a consumer to send a transaction
    from an agent location directly to a bank account in another
    country. We also provide a “Cash to Card” service that
    provides consumers an option to direct funds to a Western Union
    branded Visa stored-value card in the United States, with the
    option to have the card delivered overnight to consumers’
    homes.

Our “Next Day” delivery option is a money transfer
    that is available for payment the morning after the money
    transfer is sent. This option is available in certain markets
    for domestic service within the United States, and in
    select United States outbound and international corridors. The
    Next Day delivery service gives our consumers a lower-priced
    option for money transfers that do not need to be received
    within minutes, while still offering the convenience,
    reliability and

ease-of-use

that our consumers expect.

Online money transfer service.

Our websites allow
    consumers to send funds on-line, using a credit or debit card,
    for payment at most Western Union branded agent locations around
    the world. As of December 31, 2009, we are now providing
    send service in 18 countries, allowing consumers in these
    countries to send money throughout the world.

Telephone money transfer service.

Our Telephone
    Money Transfer service allows Western Union consumers to send
    funds by telephone without visiting an agent location. Consumers
    call a toll-free number in the United States, Canada, Ireland or
    the United Kingdom and use a debit card or credit card to
    initiate a transaction. The money transfer is then available for
    pay-out at an agent location.

Account to cash.

This service allows consumers to debit
    their bank accounts and send the money through Western Union for
    pay-out at an agent location. We have 12 banks offering this
    service, primarily through their online portals, which allows
    consumers to send funds from their bank accounts.

Mobile money transfer service.

Our mobile money transfer
    service pilot provides consumers in a number of select countries
    with the ability to transfer money to a mobile phone. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were approximately
    10,000 Western Union agent locations enabled with the
    technology to transfer cash to a mobile phone.

Distribution
    and Marketing Channels

We offer our

consumer-to-consumer

service to millions of consumers around the world primarily
    through our global network of third-party agents in almost every
    country and territory, with more than 85% of our agent locations
    being located outside of the United States. Our agents
    facilitate the global distribution and convenience associated
    with our Western Union and other brands, which in turn helps
    create demand for our services and helps us to recruit and
    retain agents. Western Union agents include large networks such
    as post offices, banks and retailers and other established
    organizations that provide other consumer products and



services. Many of our agents have multiple locations. Our agents
    know the markets they serve and work with our management to
    develop business plans for their markets. Many of our agents
    contribute financial resources, or otherwise support, our
    efforts to market the business. Many agents operate in locations
    that are convenient for our consumers and are open outside of
    traditional banking hours, for example on nights and weekends.
    Our top 40 agents globally have been with us an average of
    approximately 13 years, and in 2009, these long-standing
    agents were involved in transactions that generated more than
    60% of our

consumer-to-consumer

revenue.

We provide our third-party agents with our multi-currency,
    real-time money transfer processing systems used to originate
    and pay money transfers. Over the last several years, we have
    emphasized the development of our receive network around the
    world to optimize send and receive corridors. Our systems and
    processes enable our agents to pay money transfers in more than
    120 currencies worldwide. Many of our agents can pay in multiple
    currencies at a single location. Our agents provide the physical
    infrastructure and staff required to complete the transfers.
    Western Union provides central operating functions such as
    transaction processing, settlement, marketing support and
    customer relationship management to our agents.

Some of our agents outside the United States manage subagents.
    We refer to these agents as superagents. As of December 31,
    2009, we had approximately 800 superagents located throughout
    the world. Although our subagents are under contract with these
    superagents (and not with Western Union directly), the subagent
    locations typically have access to the same technology and
    services that our other agent locations do. On November 1,
    2009, the Payment Services Directive (“PSD”) became
    effective. Under the PSD, the licensing and other legal
    requirements for offering money transfer and other payment
    services within European Union (“EU”) countries were
    harmonized, allowing us to expand the types of businesses that
    can offer money transfer services in certain countries, which
    further allows us to develop our distribution network. In
    anticipation of the PSD, we acquired the money transfer business
    of European-based FEXCO, which helped provide an initial
    operating infrastructure for the PSD and allowed us to take on
    services and operations previously performed by this superagent
    in several key European countries.

Our international agents often customize services as appropriate
    for their geographic markets. In some markets, individual agents
    are independently offering specific services such as
    stored-value card payout options and Direct to Bank service. Our
    marketing benefits from feedback from our agents and consumers,
    and in many of our markets, our agents fund their own marketing
    activities.

A primary component of our marketing strategy is our global
    loyalty program, which is available in a growing number of
    countries. We launched our Western Union Gold Card, the
    principal vehicle of the program, in the United States in 2002.
    As of December 31, 2009, the Gold Card program was
    available in 78 countries and had approximately 13 million
    active cards, an increase in the number of active cards of 20%
    from December 31, 2008. The Gold Card offers consumers
    faster service at the

point-of-sale

and other benefits which, depending on the country, could
    include service fee reductions on future Western Union branded
    transactions, discounts at retailers or a rechargeable prepaid
    phone card embedded within the Gold Card. Overall, Gold Card
    consumers initiate more transactions and have a higher rate of
    retention than non-carded consumers. Approximately one-third of
    Western Union branded

consumer-to-consumer

transactions are initiated using a Gold Card. The global Gold
    Card program is one component of our consumer relationship
    management strategy designed to support and enhance long-term
    relationships with our consumers. Consumer databases supplement
    these efforts by providing insight on consumer preferences so
    that we can selectively target consumer communications and
    marketing. We have begun offering reloadable debit Gold Cards to
    our loyalty card holders in the United States.

Industry
    Trends

Over the last several years, except for 2009, the cross-border
    money transfer industry has experienced growth. Trends in the
    cross-border money transfer business tend to correlate to
    migration trends, global economic opportunity and related
    employment rates worldwide. The top four inbound remittance
    countries in the world are India, China, Mexico and the
    Philippines, and cumulatively receive an estimated
    $136 billion annually according to The World Bank’s
    November 2009 report. Due to the weak global economy, including

6.1


declines in consumer confidence and rising unemployment, the
    demand for money transfers has softened. The World Bank projects
    a modest increase of 1% in cross-border remittances in 2010,
    with stronger growth in 2011. We anticipate that the remittance
    market will begin to recover as the global economy improves. We
    also consider additional sources, including demographic data,
    when assessing market opportunities.

Another significant trend impacting the money transfer industry
    is the increase in regulation in recent years. Regulation in the
    United States and elsewhere focuses, in part, on anti-money
    laundering and anti-terrorist activities. Regulations require
    money transfer providers, banks and other financial institutions
    to develop systems to detect, monitor and report certain
    transactions.

Competition

We face robust competition in the highly-fragmented

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer industry. We compete with a variety of money
    transfer service providers, including:

•

Global money transfer providers

—Global money
    transfer providers allow consumers to send money to a wide
    variety of locations, in both their home countries and abroad.

•

Regional money transfer providers

—Regional money
    transfer providers, or “niche” players, provide the
    same services as global money transfer providers, but focus on a
    small group of corridors or services within one region, such as
    North America to the Caribbean, Central or South America, or
    Western Europe to North Africa.

•

Banks and postbanks

—Banks and postbanks of all sizes
    compete with us in a number of ways, including bank wire
    services and card-based services. We believe that banks and
    postbanks offer consumers wire transfer services and other money
    transfer methods as an incentive to those consumers to purchase
    other services and products.

•

Informal networks

—Informal networks enable people to
    transfer funds without formal mechanisms and often without
    compliance with government reporting requirements. We believe
    that such networks comprise a significant share of the market.

•

Electronic commerce

—Online money transfer services
    allow consumers to send and receive money electronically using
    the internet.

•

Alternative channels

—Alternative channels for
    sending and receiving money include mail and commercial courier
    services, money transfers using mobile phones, and card-based
    options, such as ATM cards and stored-value cards.

We believe the most significant competitive factors in

consumer-to-consumer

remittances relate to brand recognition, trust and reliability,
    distribution network, consumer experience and price.

Global
    Business Payments Segment

In our global business payments segment, we provide fast and
    convenient options to make one-time or recurring payments for
    consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business
    payments services allow consumers to make payments to a variety
    of organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies,
    mortgage servicers, financial service providers, governmental
    agencies and other businesses. We also provide international

business-to-business

cross-border, cross-currency payment services as a result of our
    acquisition of Custom House in September 2009. We can process
    payments using the customer’s credit card, debit card, bank
    account or cash depending on the service selected. We believe
    our business customers who receive payments from consumers
    benefit from their relationship with Western Union as it
    provides them with real-time or near real-time posting of their
    customer payments. In certain circumstances, our relationships
    with business customers also provide them with an additional
    source of income, as well as reduced expenses for cash and check
    handling.



Operations

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from
    transaction fees paid by the consumer. These fees are typically
    less than the fees charged in our

consumer-to-consumer

segment. Consumers may make a cash payment at an agent or owned
    location and businesses may remit a check, electronic or wire
    transfer to Custom
    House

®

in order to initiate a transaction. In order to make an
    electronic payment, consumers or businesses initiate a
    transaction over the telephone or the internet which we process
    through credit card, debit card, automated clearing house
    (“ACH”) or wire transfer, depending on the service
    selected. Our internet services are provided through our own
    websites or, in certain circumstances, in partnership with other
    websites for which we act as the service provider. In
    cross-border transactions involving different currencies, we
    primarily generate revenue based on the difference between the
    exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business and the rate
    at which we are able to acquire currency. In addition, we
    generate revenue from upfront enrollment fees received for our
    Equity
    Accelerator

®

service, and we earn investment income on funds received from
    services sold in advance of settlement with payment recipients.

Although most of the revenue in our global business payments
    segment is generated in the United States, we continue to expand
    our international presence and globally diversify our revenue,
    primarily through our acquisition of Custom House and our
    previous acquisition of Pago
    Fácil

.

Services

Our global business payments services are available through a
    variety of products which give customers choices as to the
    payment channel and method of payment, and include the following:

Custom House.

Our recent acquisition of Custom House
    enables us to offer international cross-border, cross-currency

business-to-business

payment solutions. These payment transactions are conducted
    through various channels including the telephone and internet.
    Custom House operates its own website to offer services and also
    serves as the ultimate service provider for other partner
    websites. Payments are made predominately through wire transfers
    and ACH, but in some situations, checks are remitted to Custom
    House. The majority of Custom House’s business relates to
    exchanges of currency at the spot rate which enables customers
    to make cross-currency payments. In addition, we write foreign
    currency forward and option contracts for customers to
    facilitate future payments.

Western Union Quick
    Collect

®

.

    The Western Union Quick Collect (“Quick Collect”)
    service allows consumers to send funds to businesses and
    government agencies across the United States and Canada, using
    cash and, in certain locations, a debit card. This service is
    offered primarily at Western Union agent locations, but may be
    provided via our westernunion.com website in limited situations.
    This service is also offered in select international locations
    under the service mark Quick
    Pay

    We also offer Quick
    Cash

,

    a cash disbursement service used by businesses and government
    agencies to send money to employees or individuals with whom
    they have accounts or other business relationships. Similar to
    our Quick Collect service, consumers use our Western Union
    Convenience
    Pay

®

(“Convenience Pay”) service to send payments by cash
    or check from a smaller number of Convenience Pay agent
    locations primarily to utilities and telecommunication providers.

Pago
    Fácil

.

In South America, we offer walk-in, cash bill payment services
    which allow consumers to make payments for services such as
    phone, utilities and other recurring bills. In Argentina, we
    provide this service under the Pago Fácil brand. In 2008,
    we began offering this service under the Western Union brand in
    Peru and Panama.

Speedpay

®

.

    Our Speedpay service is offered principally in the United States
    and allows consumers to make payments to a variety of businesses
    using credit cards, debit cards, ACH and in limited situations,
    checks. Payments are initiated over the telephone or the
    internet. We also partner with some businesses to allow their
    customers to access Speedpay from their websites.

Equity Accelerator.

Our Equity Accelerator service
    enables consumers to make mortgage payments by ACH. It is
    marketed as a convenient way for homeowners to schedule
    additional recurring principal payments on their mortgages.
    Consumers who enroll in this service make mortgage payments
    based on an accelerated



program, which results in a more rapid reduction of their
    mortgage balance, as well as interest savings. We also offer a
    non-recurring mortgage payment service under the brand Just in
    Time
    EFT

®

.

Distribution
    and Marketing Channels

Our electronic consumer payment services are available primarily
    through the telephone and the internet, while our cash-based
    consumer services are available through our agent networks and
    select Company owned locations. Our business payment services
    are offered through owned locations, telephone, via the internet
    and partner channels.

Businesses market our services to consumers in a number of ways,
    and we market our services directly to consumers and businesses
    using a variety of means, including advertising materials,
    promotional activities, call campaigns and attendance at trade
    shows and seminars. Our internet services are marketed to
    consumers and businesses on our websites as well as through
    co-branding arrangements with our website partners who offer our
    payment solutions. Consumers can also participate in the Western
    Union Gold Card program when using our Quick Collect service.

We have relationships with more than 6,300 businesses to which
    our consumers can make payments, approximately 2,200 of which
    primarily relate to our bill payment business in Argentina, Pago
    Fácil. These relationships are a core component of our
    global business payments services. In 2009, our top 20
    businesses to which our consumers can make payments represented
    approximately 40% of our global business payments revenue. On
    average, we have provided our payment services to our top 20
    businesses to which our consumers can make payments for more
    than 14 years. No individual customer accounted for greater
    than 10% of this segment’s revenue during all periods
    presented.

Our growth strategy includes a focus on expanding and
    globalizing our global business payments segment and increasing
    our number of payment options.

Industry
    Trends

The global business payments industry has evolved with
    technological innovations that have created new methods of
    processing payments from individuals or businesses to other
    businesses. The cross-border payments industry is expected to
    expand considerably in the future due to the expanding global
    focus of many businesses. We believe that the United States is
    in the midst of a trend away from cash and paper checks toward
    electronic payment methods accessible through multiple
    technologies. Furthermore, due to the weak economic situation in
    the United States, we believe many United States consumers who
    would use our services are having difficulty paying their bills
    and are unable to obtain credit, resulting in our handling fewer
    bill payments.

The global business payments industry outside the United States
    is at varying stages of development. In some countries, walk-in
    cash payments or payments through a third-party network are
    widely used, while in other countries electronic payment
    options, particularly through direct debit, are widely accepted.

Competition

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers
    offering both cash and electronic-based payment solutions and

business-to-business

payment services. Competition in electronic payments and

business-to-business

payment services include financial institutions (which may offer
    consumer bill payment or business payment services in their own
    name or may “host” payment services operated under the
    names of their clients). Competition for electronic payments
    also includes businesses offering their own or third-party
    services to their own customers and third-party providers of all
    sizes offering services directly to consumers. In many cases,
    competitors specialize in a small number of industries.
    Competitors for cash payments include businesses that allow
    consumers to pay a bill at one of their locations, or at the
    location of a partner business, as well as mail and courier
    services. Competitive pressures are impacting this business.



The most significant competitive factors in this segment relate
    to brand recognition, customer service, trust and reliability,
    convenience, speed, variety of payment methods, service
    offerings and price.

For additional details regarding our global business payments
    segment, see Item 7 of Part II and our historical
    financial statements and the notes to those statements included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Other

Our remaining businesses are grouped in the “Other”
    category, which primarily includes our money order services.

Effective October 1, 2009 (the “Transition
    Date”), in accordance with the agreement signed on
    July 18, 2008, Integrated Payment Systems Inc.
    (“IPS”), a subsidiary of First Data Corporation
    (“First Data”), assigned and transferred to us certain
    operating assets used by IPS to issue Western Union branded
    money orders and approximately $860 million of cash
    sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities.
    On the Transition Date, we assumed IPS’s role as issuer of
    the money orders, including its obligation to pay outstanding
    money orders, and terminated the existing agreement whereby IPS
    paid Western Union a fixed return of 5.5% on the outstanding
    money order balances. Following the Transition Date, we invested
    the cash received from IPS in high-quality, investment grade
    securities, primarily tax exempt United States state and
    municipal securities, in accordance with applicable regulations,
    which are the same as those currently governing the investment
    of our United States originated money transfer principal. Prior
    to the Transition Date, we had entered into interest rate swaps
    on certain of our fixed rate notes to reduce our exposure to
    fluctuations in interest rates. Through a combination of the
    revenue generated from these investment securities and the
    anticipated interest expense savings resulting from the interest
    rate swaps, we estimate that we should be able to retain,
    subsequent to the Transition Date, a materially comparable
    after-tax rate of return through 2011 as we were receiving under
    the agreement with IPS. However, the results of interest expense
    savings related to the swaps will be reflected in interest
    expense and will not impact operating income. Subsequent to the
    Transition Date, all revenue generated from the investment
    portfolio is being retained by us.

Intellectual
    Property

The Western Union brand, consisting of trademark registrations
    in many countries, is material to our Company. The international
    expansion of our agent network over the past decade has taken
    the Western Union brand nearly everywhere consumers send and
    receive money. The loss of the Western Union trademark or a
    diminution in the perceived quality associated with the name
    would harm our growth. We offer money transfer services under
    the Western Union, Orlandi

brands in over 200 countries and territories, and various global
    business payment services under several brands like Speedpay,

    Paymap

®

,

    Quick Collect, Convenience Pay, Quick Pay, Quick Cash, Pago
    Fácil (registered in Argentina), Custom House and other
    trademarks and service marks also important to our Company.

Our operating results over the past several years have allowed
    us to invest significantly each year to support our brands. In
    2009, we invested approximately $240 million to market,
    advertise and promote our brand and services, including costs
    related to our global “yes!” marketing campaign, which
    helped drive uniformity of brand image and marketing. Many of
    our agents have also contributed significant financial resources
    to assist with marketing our services.

We own patents and patent applications covering various aspects
    of our processes and services. We have been, are and in the
    future may be, subject to claims and suits alleging that our
    technology or business methods infringe patents owned by others,
    both in and out of the United States. Unfavorable resolution of
    these claims could require us to change how we deliver services,
    result in significant financial consequences, or both, which
    could adversely affect our business, financial position and
    results of operations.



Risk
    Management

Our Company has a credit risk management department that
    evaluates and monitors our agent-related credit and fraud risks.
    We are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances
    from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment and
    money order settlement process. We also are exposed to credit
    risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through
    our online services and electronic global business payment
    channels, where transactions are originated through means other
    than cash, and may therefore be subject to
    “chargebacks,” insufficient funds or other collection
    impediments, such as fraud. Our credit risk management team
    performs a credit review before each agent signing and conducts
    periodic analyses. As a result, our losses associated with bad
    debts have been less than 1% of our annual revenue in each of
    the last three fiscal years. However, the recent global economic
    crisis may increase our losses associated with bad debts.

A key component of the Western Union business model is our
    ability to manage financial risk associated with conducting
    transactions worldwide. We settle accounts with the majority of
    our agents in United States dollars or euros. We utilize foreign
    currency exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts, to
    mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations and to
    provide predictability of future cash flows. Limited foreign
    currency risk arises with respect to the agent settlement
    process. The foreign currency exchange risk is limited because
    the majority of money transfer transactions are paid within
    24 hours after they are initiated and agent settlements
    occur within a few days in most instances.

As a result of our acquisition of Custom House, we are now
    exposed to credit risk relating to derivative financial
    instruments written by us to our customers. The duration of
    these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. To
    mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an
    ongoing basis. In addition, we may require certain customers to
    post collateral based on the fair value of the customer’s
    contract and their risk profile. As we require the receipt of
    funds from our customers, in most cases, before releasing the
    associated cross-currency payment, the credit risk arising from
    our spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely
    mitigated.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to
    investment securities, money market fund investments and other
    credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with
    banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment
    concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit
    ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among
    global financial institutions.

Our financial results may fluctuate due to changes in interest
    rates. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed
    rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each,
    while also considering the duration of the individual positions.
    We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an
    attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and optimize returns. Our
    exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix
    of our interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of
    fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished
    primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the terms
    of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use
    interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the
    percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions.

International
    Investment

We have accumulated approximately $2.0 billion of foreign
    earnings at December 31, 2009, for which no provision has
    been made for United States federal and state income taxes, as
    we have reinvested or expect to reinvest these earnings outside
    the United States indefinitely. We intend to invest these
    earnings to expand and diversify our global distribution and
    explore new service offerings. In 2009, we used our foreign
    earnings to acquire the money transfer business of our largest
    European-based agent, FEXCO, and also to acquire Custom House,
    which expanded the service offerings of the global business
    payments segment to include cross-currency, cross-border

business-to-business

payments. We continue to look for opportunities for
    international acquisitions and investments in joint ventures
    that will complement our existing businesses worldwide. We may
    also invest in expanding our current service offerings or our
    international operating sites to drive organic growth. However,
    if we are unable to utilize these earnings outside of the United
    States and we repatriate these earnings to the United States in
    the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be
    subject to



United States federal income taxes (subject to an
    adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and
    possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.

Regulation

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations
    enacted by the United States federal government, each of the
    states, many localities and other countries. These include
    financial services regulations, consumer disclosure and consumer
    protection laws, currency control regulations, money transfer
    and payment instrument licensing regulations, payment service
    laws, rules, laws and regulations applicable to credit cards and
    electronic payments including those governing foreign exchange
    hedging services and the sale of spot and forward currency
    contracts, escheat laws and laws covering consumer privacy, data
    protection and information security. Our services also are
    subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory
    requirements intended to help detect and prevent money
    laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activity.
    Failure to comply with any of these requirements—by either
    Western Union or its agents or subagents (who are third parties,
    over whom Western Union has limited legal and practical
    control)—could result in the suspension or revocation of a
    license or registration required to provide money transfer
    services

and/or

payment services or foreign exchange products, the limitation,
    suspension or termination of services, the seizure of our
    assets,

and/or

the
    imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines and
    restrictions on our ability to offer services.

We have developed and continue to enhance global compliance
    programs, consisting of an anti-money laundering program
    comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal controls
    to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, we continue to adapt our business
    practices and strategies to help us comply with current and
    evolving legal standards and industry practices. These programs
    include dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring
    programs, suspicious activity reporting, regulatory outreach and
    education, and support and guidance to our agent network on
    regulatory compliance. Our money transfer network operates
    through third-party agents in most countries, and, therefore,
    our legal and practical ability to control those agents’
    compliance activities is limited. With the PSD coming into
    effect, we will become responsible for the compliance of our
    agents in the EU who are engaged by one of our payments
    institution subsidiaries. In addition, with the acquisition of
    Custom House, our regulatory requirements have increased.

Money
    Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing and
    Regulation

In the United States, most states license money transfer
    services providers. Many states exercise authority over the
    operations of our money transfer services and, as part of this
    authority, regularly examine us. Many states require us to
    invest the proceeds of money transfers in high-quality,
    investment grade securities, and our use of such investments is
    restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations. We
    regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our
    exposure by making high-quality investments in compliance with
    these regulations. The majority of our investment securities,
    classified within “settlement assets” in the
    consolidated balance sheets, most of which relate to state
    licensing requirements in the United States, had credit ratings
    of “AA-” or better from a major credit rating agency
    as of December 31, 2009.

These licensing laws also cover matters such as government
    approval of controlling shareholders and senior management of
    our licensed entities, regulatory approval of agent locations,
    consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the
    licensee, and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain
    certain net worth levels. Many states also require money
    transmitters and their agents to comply with federal

and/or

state
    anti-money laundering laws and regulations.

Our money transfer and money order services are subject to
    anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank
    Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
    (collectively, the “BSA”) and similar state laws and
    regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money
    transfer companies and the issuers and sellers of money orders,
    to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering
    programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious
    activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information
    about consumers who use their services and maintain other
    transaction records. Many states impose similar



and, in some cases, more stringent requirements. These
    requirements also apply to our agents. In addition, the United
    States Department of the Treasury has interpreted the BSA to
    require money transfer companies to conduct due diligence into
    and risk-based monitoring of their agents inside and outside the
    United States.

Economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the United
    States Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets
    Control (“OFAC”) prohibit or restrict transactions to
    or from (or dealings with) certain countries, their governments,
    and in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with
    specifically-designated individuals and entities such as
    narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations.
    We provide very limited

consumer-to-consumer

services to individuals in Cuba, Syria and Sudan pursuant to and
    as authorized by advisory opinions of, or licenses granted by,
    OFAC.

Outside of the United States, our money transfer business is
    subject to some form of regulation in all of the countries and
    territories in which we offer those services. These laws and
    regulations may include limitations on what types of entities
    may offer money transfer services, limitations on the amount of
    principal that can be sent into or out of a country, limitations
    on the number of money transfers that may be sent or received by
    a consumer and agreements on the rates of exchange between
    currencies. They may also include laws and regulations intended
    to help detect and prevent money laundering or terrorist
    financing. In most countries, our agents are required to obtain
    licenses or permits to offer money transfer services.

We have developed and continue to enhance global compliance
    programs to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory
    requirements. Our money transfer network operates through
    third-party agents in most countries, and our legal and
    practical ability to control those agents’ compliance
    activities is limited. To assist in managing and monitoring
    money laundering and terrorist financing risks, we have
    developed and continue to enhance our global compliance
    programs, consisting of an anti-money laundering compliance
    program comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal
    controls. As of December 31, 2009, we had over
    400 employees in a number of our offices around the world
    dedicated to our global compliance programs. We spent over
    $40 million in 2009 on these efforts. In connection with
    our agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona, we will
    fund a not-for-profit organization to promote safety and
    security along the entire United States and Mexico border. This
    agreement and settlement also resolved all outstanding legal
    issues and claims with the State. In addition, as part of the
    agreement and settlement, we expect to make certain investments
    in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico
    border and to engage a monitor of that program, which are
    expected to cost up to $23 million over the next two to
    four years. See also Item 1A, Risk
    Factors—“Western Union has been the subject of
    class-action litigation, and remains the subject of other
    litigation as well as consent agreements with or enforcement
    actions by regulators” for more information on this
    agreement and settlement.

Government agencies both inside and outside the United States
    may impose new or additional rules on money transfers affecting
    us or our agents, including regulations that:

•

prohibit transactions in, to or from certain countries,
    governments and individuals and entities;

•

impose additional identification, reporting or recordkeeping
    requirements;

•

limit the entities capable of providing money transfer services
    or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;

•

impose minimum capital or other financial requirements on us or
    our agents;

•

limit or restrict the revenue which may be generated from money
    transfers, including transaction fees and revenue derived from
    foreign exchange;

•

require additional disclosures to consumers;

•

require the principal amount of money transfers originated in a
    country to be invested in that country or held in trust until
    they are paid; or

•

limit the number or principal amount of money transfers which
    may be sent to or from the jurisdiction, whether by an
    individual, through one agent or in aggregate.

One example of such a rule is the Payment Services Directive
    which became effective on November 1, 2009. The PSD has
    changed the payments market in the EU, harmonizing the licensing
    and certain other



requirements for offering payment services within the EU.
    Previously, those requirements differed significantly among
    these countries. The PSD also imposed new rules on payment
    service providers like Western Union. In particular, the PSD
    makes us responsible for the compliance of our agents in the EU
    who are engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries.
    Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory action against us because
    of the actions of our EU agents and their subagents has
    increased. Under the PSD, we are now subject to investment
    safeguarding rules and periodic examinations similar to those we
    are subject to in the United States. These rules have resulted
    in increased costs to comply with the new requirements. The PSD
    could also increase competition in our areas of service.

Escheat
    Regulations

Our Company is subject to unclaimed or abandoned property
    (escheat) laws in the United States and abroad. These laws
    require us to turn over to certain government authorities the
    property of others held by our Company that has been unclaimed
    for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers.
    We hold property subject to escheat laws and we have an ongoing
    program to comply with the laws. We are subject to audits with
    regard to our escheatment practices.

Privacy
    and Information Security Regulations

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of
    personal information is required to provide our services. These
    activities are subject to information security standards, data
    privacy, data breach and related laws and regulations in the
    United States and other countries. In the United States, data
    privacy and data breach laws such as the federal
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws apply directly to
    a broad range of financial institutions including money
    transmitters like Western Union, and indirectly to companies
    that provide services to those institutions. Many state laws
    require us to provide notification to affected individuals,
    state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a
    security breach of computer databases or physical documents that
    contain certain types of

non-public

personal information and present a risk for unauthorized use.

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of
    personal information required to provide our services is subject
    to data privacy laws outside of the United States, such as laws
    adopted pursuant to the EU’s 95/46 EC Directive of the
    European Parliament (the “Data Protection Directive”),
    Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic
    Documents Act, individual European national laws and data
    privacy laws of other provinces or countries. In some cases, the
    laws of a country may be more restrictive than the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the laws developed to comply with the
    Data Protection Directive may impose additional duties on
    companies. Each of these laws may restrict the collection,
    transfer, processing, storage, use and disclosure of sensitive
    personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy
    practices and may give individuals certain rights to prevent the
    use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes
    such as marketing.

These regulations, laws and industry standards also impose
    requirements for safeguarding personal information through the
    issuance of internal data security standards, controls or
    guidelines.

In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the
    prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and
    pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, Western Union
    makes information available to certain United States federal and
    state, as well as certain foreign government agencies when
    required by law. In recent years, these agencies have increased
    their requests for such information from Western Union and other
    companies (both financial service providers and others),
    particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist
    financing or identity theft. During the same period, there has
    also been increased public attention regarding the corporate use
    and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by
    legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data
    protection, information security and consumer privacy. These
    regulatory goals—the prevention of money laundering,
    terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the
    individual’s right to privacy—may create a conflict,
    and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While
    we believe that Western Union is compliant with its regulatory
    responsibilities, the legal, political and business environments
    in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation,
    regulation, litigation, court



rulings or other events could expose Western Union to increased
    program costs, liability and reputational damage.

Banking
    Regulation

Western Union International Bank operates under a banking
    license granted by the Austrian Financial Market Authority
    (“FMA”), allowing the bank to offer a range of
    financial services in the 27 member states of the EU and the 3
    additional states of the European Economic Area. The banking
    license subjects our bank to the Austrian Banking Act regulation
    by the FMA and the Austrian National Bank. The bank also is
    subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the New
    York State Banking Department (the “Banking
    Department”), which has regulatory authority over our
    subsidiary that holds all interest in the bank, a limited
    liability investment company organized under Article XII of
    the New York Banking Law. An Agreement of Supervision with the
    Banking Department imposes various regulatory requirements
    including operational limitations, capital requirements,
    affiliate transaction limitations, and notice and reporting
    requirements. Banking Department approval is required under the
    New York Banking Law and the Agreement of Supervision prior to
    any change in control of the Article XII investment company.

Since Western Union International Bank does not operate any
    banking offices in the United States and does not conduct
    business in the United States except as may be incidental to its
    activities outside the United States, our Company’s
    affiliation with Western Union International Bank does not cause
    it to be subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company
    Act.

In Brazil, we have submitted applications to the Central Bank of
    Brazil for commercial bank and exchange broker licenses. Such
    licenses will enable us to engage in financial services which we
    are unable to provide today, including domestic money transfer
    and bill payments.

Other

Some of our services are subject to card association rules and
    regulations. For example, an independent standards-setting
    organization, the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”)
    Security Standards Council (including American Express, Discover
    Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and
    Visa Inc. International) developed a set of comprehensive
    requirements concerning payment card account security through
    the transaction process, called the Payment Card Industry Data
    Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). All merchants and
    service providers that store, process and transmit payment card
    data are required to comply with PCI DSS as a condition to
    accepting credit cards. We are subject to annual reviews to
    ensure compliance with PCI regulations worldwide and are subject
    to fines if we are found to be non-compliant.

Stored-value services offered by Western Union prepaid services
    are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to
    consumer protection, licensing, escheat and money laundering.
    These laws are evolving, unclear and sometimes inconsistent, and
    the extent to which these laws apply to Western Union or its
    consumers is in a state of change. We are unable to determine
    the impact that the clarification of these laws and their future
    interpretations may have on these services.

Employees
    and Labor

As of January 31, 2010, our businesses employed
    approximately 6,800 employees. Our United States based
    employees are no longer represented by any unions or collective

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business, financial
    position and results of operations, some of which are beyond our
    control. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risks
    described below. You should carefully consider all of these
    risks.

Risks
    Relating to Our Business and Industry

Interruptions
    in migration patterns, including as a result of economic
    conditions, could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our money transfer business relies in large part on migration,
    which brings workers to countries with greater economic
    opportunities than those available in their native countries. A
    significant portion of money transfers are sent by international
    migrants. Migration is affected by (among other factors) overall
    economic conditions, the availability of job opportunities,
    changes in immigration laws, and political or other events (such
    as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that would make it more
    difficult for workers to migrate or work abroad. Changes to
    these factors could adversely affect our remittance volume and
    could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

Many of our consumers work in industries that may be impacted by
    deteriorating economic conditions more quickly or significantly
    than other industries. Reduced job opportunities, especially in
    construction, manufacturing, hospitality, agriculture and
    retail, or overall weakness in the world’s economies, such
    as that currently being experienced, could adversely affect the
    number of money transfer transactions, the principal amounts
    transferred and correspondingly our results of operations. If
    general market softness in the economies of countries important
    to migrant workers continues, our results of operations could be
    adversely impacted. Additionally, if our consumer transactions
    decline, if the amount of money that consumers send per
    transaction declines, or if migration patterns shift due to weak
    or deteriorating economic conditions, our results of operations
    may be adversely affected.

Our
    ability to adopt technology in response to changing industry and
    consumer needs or trends poses a challenge to our
    business.

Our ability to compete in the markets we serve may be threatened
    by change, including changes in technology, changes with respect
    to consumer needs, competition and industry standards. We
    actively seek solutions that respond in a timely manner to new
    technology-based money transfer services such as internet, land
    and mobile phone-based money transfer services and prepaid,
    stored-value and other card-based money transfer services.
    Failure to respond well to these challenges could adversely
    impact our business, financial position and results of
    operations. Further, even if the company responds well to these
    challenges, the business and financial models offered by many of
    these alternatives, more technology-reliant means of money
    transfer may be materially less advantageous to us than the
    model offered by our traditional cash/agent model.

Our
    business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations,
    especially laws designed to prevent money laundering and
    terrorist financing. Failure by us, our agents or subagents to
    comply with those laws and regulations could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

As described under Item 1 of Part I, our business is
    subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. These include
    financial services regulations, consumer disclosure and consumer
    protection laws, currency control regulations, money transfer
    and payment instrument licensing regulations, escheat laws and
    laws covering consumer privacy, data protection and information
    security. Proposed legislation relating to financial services
    providers and consumer protection in various jurisdictions
    around the world may also affect the manner in which we provide
    our services.

In the United States, several bills pending in the Senate and
    House of Representatives could change the way that financial
    services companies are regulated, managed and able to present
    their products and services to consumers. It remains unclear how
    these various proposals will be reconciled and enacted, and how
    a final version would affect our business. However, most of the
    proposals have in common the creation of a new



Consumer Financial Protection Agency. These proposals would also
    give both consumers and government agencies new rights to
    challenge the financial services provided and would change the
    way financial services are presented and sold. These rights
    could include, for example, enhanced disclosure of foreign
    exchange calculations to remittance senders. Such changes could
    be costly for us to implement and oversee, and could expose us
    to increased regulatory oversight

and/or

litigation.

Our services also are subject to an increasingly strict set of
    legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and
    prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit
    activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges,
    regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often
    quickly and with little notice. Economic and trade sanctions
    programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury
    Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibit or
    restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified
    countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances,
    their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are
    specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics
    traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As
    U.S. federal and state as well as foreign legislative and
    regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action in these areas
    increase, we expect that our costs of complying with these
    requirements will increase, perhaps substantially. Failure to
    comply with any of these requirements—by us or by our
    agents and their subagents (who are third parties over whom we
    have limited legal and practical control) could result in the
    suspension or revocation of a license or registration required
    to provide money transfer services, the limitation, suspension
    or termination of services, the seizure

and/or

forfeiture of our assets

and/or

the
    imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. In
    addition to those direct costs, a failure by us or by our agents
    and their subagents to comply with applicable laws and
    regulations also could seriously damage our reputation and
    brands, and result in diminished revenue and profit and
    increased operating costs.

In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the
    prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and
    pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, we make
    information available to certain United States federal and
    state, as well as certain foreign government agencies when
    required by law. In recent years, these agencies have increased
    their requests for such information from us and other companies
    (both financial service providers and others), particularly in
    connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing. During
    the same period, there has also been increased public attention
    regarding the corporate use and disclosure of personal
    information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended
    to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer
    privacy. These regulatory goals—the prevention of money
    laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the
    protection of the individual’s right to privacy—may
    conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or
    settled. While we believe that we are compliant with our
    regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and business
    environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent
    legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other
    events could expose us to increased program costs, liability and
    reputational damage.

Changes in the regulatory environment may also impact the manner
    in which we may operate our business or may change the
    competitive landscape. Proposed legislation related to financial
    services providers and consumer protection in various
    jurisdictions around the world and at the federal and state
    level in the United States may subject us to additional
    regulatory oversight, mandate additional consumer disclosures,
    mandate additional taxes or fees to be imposed upon consumers,
    or otherwise impact the manner in which we provide our services.
    One example of such a change is the Payment Services Directive
    (“PSD”) which became effective on November 1,
    2009. The PSD has changed the payments market in the European
    Union (“EU”), harmonizing the licensing and certain
    other requirements for offering payment and other financial
    services, including remittances within the EU. Previously, those
    requirements differed significantly among these countries. The
    PSD also imposed new rules on payment service providers like
    Western Union. In particular, with the PSD coming into effect,
    Western Union will become responsible for the compliance of its
    agents in the EU who are engaged by one of our payments
    institution subsidiaries. Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory
    action against Western Union because of actions by its EU agents
    and their subagents has increased. These changes could result in
    increased costs to comply with the new requirements, or in the
    event we or our agents are unable to comply, could have an
    adverse impact on our business, financial position and results
    of operations. The PSD could also increase competition in some
    or all of our areas of service. Additional countries are likely
    to adopt legislation similar to the PSD.



Our fees

and/or

foreign exchange spreads may be reduced or limited because of
    regulatory initiatives or proceedings that are either industry
    wide or specifically targeted at our company. For example,
    initiatives both in the United States and at G-8 summit meetings
    have focused on lowering international remittance costs. These
    initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business,
    financial position and results of operations.

Recently, one state passed a law imposing a fee on certain money
    transfer transactions. We are working with legislators in that
    state to clarify the application of the fee. Although there is
    generally no sales tax on money transfer services elsewhere in
    the United States, the current budget shortfalls in many
    jurisdictions may lead other states or localities to impose
    similar taxes or fees. A tax or fee on money transfer services
    like Western Union could put us at a competitive disadvantage to
    other means of remittance which are not subject to the same
    taxes or fees.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (the “FCPA”) in the United States and
    similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit
    companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments
    to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
    business. Because our services are offered in virtually every
    country of the world, we face a higher risk associated with FCPA
    compliance than many other companies. Any determination that we
    have violated these laws could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws
    in the United States and abroad which require us to turn over to
    certain government authorities the property of others held by us
    that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as
    unpaid money transfers. We hold property subject to escheat laws
    and we have an ongoing program to comply with those laws. In
    addition, we are subject to audits with regard to our
    escheatment practices. Any difference between the amounts we
    have accrued for unclaimed property and amounts that are claimed
    by a state or foreign jurisdiction could have a significant
    impact on our results of operations and cash flows. See
    “—Escheat Regulations” for further discussion.

Our business is subject to various United States federal, state
    and local laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations
    outside the United States. Our United States business is subject
    to reporting, recordkeeping and anti-money laundering provisions
    of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of
    2001, and to regulatory oversight and enforcement by the United
    States Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement
    Network, or “FinCEN.” In addition, as a money
    transmitter, we are subject to licensing, regulation and
    examination by almost all the states and the District of
    Columbia. With the advent of the EU Payment Services Directive
    we have become directly subject to reporting, recordkeeping and
    anti-money laundering regulations in the EU. Our business in the
    EU is now subject to licensing, regulation and examination by
    our regulators in Ireland and the United Kingdom. If additional
    countries adopt money transfer legislation similar to the PSD,
    we could become subject to licensing, regulation and examination
    in those locations, as well.

Current
    difficult conditions in the global financial markets, the global
    economic crisis and continued financial market disruptions could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

The global capital and credit markets have been experiencing
    unprecedented volatility and disruption and we face certain
    risks in the event that such events reoccur, including:

•

Our agents or other business relationships having reduced sales
    or business as a result of a deterioration in economic
    conditions. As a result, our agents could reduce their numbers
    of locations or hours of operation, or cease doing business
    altogether. Businesses using our services may make fewer
    cross-currency payments or may have fewer customers making
    payments to them through us, particularly businesses in those
    industries that may be more affected by an economic downturn
    such as the automobile, mortgage and financial services
    industries.

•

Our revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks is one
    source for funding liquidity needs and also backs our commercial
    paper program. If any of the banks participating in our credit
    facility fails



to fulfill its lending commitment to us, our short-term
    liquidity and ability to support borrowings under our commercial
    paper program could be adversely affected.

•

We may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness as it
    becomes due or we may have to refinance on unfavorable terms,
    which could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our
    cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby
    reducing funds available for working capital, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other purposes.

•

The market value of the securities in our investment portfolio
    may substantially decline. The impact of that decline in value
    may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

•

The derivative financial instruments that we use reduce our
    exposure to various market risks including changes in interest
    rates and foreign exchange rates. Our counterparties to our
    derivative instruments may fail to honor their obligations,
    which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. That
    failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

•

We aggregate our foreign exchange exposures in our Custom House
    business, including the exposure generated by the derivative
    contracts we write to our customers as part of our
    cross-currency payments business, and typically hedges the net
    exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial
    institution counterparties. If our customers fail to honor their
    obligations or if the counterparties to our offsetting positions
    fail to honor their obligations, our business, financial
    position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

•

Our exposure to receivables from our agents, consumers and
    businesses could impact us. For more information on this risk,
    see risk factor,

“We face credit, liquidity and fraud
    risks from our agents, consumers and businesses that could
    adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
    operations.”

•

The third-party service providers on whom we depend may
    experience difficulties in their businesses, which may impair
    their ability to provide services to us and have a potential
    impact on our own business. The impact of a change or temporary
    stoppage of services may have an adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

•

Banks upon which we rely to conduct our businesses could fail.
    This could lead to our inability to access funds

and/or

credit losses for us and could adversely impact our ability to
    conduct our business.

•

If market disruption and volatility occurs, we could experience
    difficulty in accessing capital and our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Risks
    associated with operations outside the United States and foreign
    currencies could adversely affect our business, financial
    position and results of operations.

An increasing portion of our revenue is generated in currencies
    other than the United States dollar. As a result, we are subject
    to risks associated with changes in the value of our revenues
    denominated in foreign currency. We also recently acquired
    Canada-based Custom House which provides currency conversion and
    foreign exchange hedging services to its customers. In order to
    mitigate these risks, we enter into derivative contracts.
    However, these contracts do not eliminate all of the risks
    related to fluctuating foreign currency rates.

With the acquisition of Custom House in the third quarter of
    2009, our foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange
    risk management has increased due to the nature of this
    business. The significant majority of Custom House’s
    revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling
    customers to make cross-currency payments. This business also
    writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our
    customers. The duration of these derivatives contracts is
    generally nine months or less. Custom House aggregates its
    foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts,
    including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges
    the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting
    contracts with



established financial institution counterparties. If we are
    unable to obtain offsetting positions, our business, financial
    position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

A significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the
    United States and much of the cash and cash equivalents from
    this business are held by our foreign entities. Repatriating
    these funds to the United States would, in many cases,
    result in significant tax obligations because most of these
    funds have been taxed at foreign tax rates that are relatively
    low compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the
    United States. If repatriation of these funds is required or if
    a change in legislation requires a different tax treatment, that
    could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

Money transfers and payments to, from or within or between
    countries may be limited or prohibited by law. At times in the
    past, we have been required to cease operations in particular
    countries due to political uncertainties or government
    restrictions imposed by foreign governments or the United
    States. Occasionally agents have been required by their
    regulators to cease offering our services. Additionally,
    economic or political instability or natural disasters may make
    money transfers to, from or within a particular country
    difficult, such as when banks are closed, when currency
    devaluation makes exchange rates difficult to manage or when
    natural disasters or civil unrest makes access to agent
    locations unsafe. These risks could negatively impact our
    ability to make payments to or receive payments from
    international agents or our ability to recoup funds that have
    been advanced to international agents and could adversely affect
    our business, financial position and results of operations. In
    addition, the general state of telecommunications and
    infrastructure in some lesser developed countries, including
    countries where we have a large number of transactions, creates
    operational risks for us and our agents that generally are not
    present in our operations in the United States and other more
    developed countries.

Many of our agents outside the United States are post offices,
    which are usually owned and operated by national governments.
    These governments may decide to change the terms under which
    they allow post offices to offer remittances and other financial
    services. For example, governments may decide to separate
    financial service operations from postal operations, or mandate
    the creation or privatization of a “post bank” or they
    may require multiple service providers in their network. These
    changes could have an adverse effect on our ability to
    distribute, offer or price our services in countries that are
    material to our business.

Changes
    in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies
    could adversely affect our tax expense.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally. From
    time to time, the United States Congress and foreign, state and
    local governments consider legislation that could increase our
    effective tax rates. Recent proposed changes to the United
    States tax laws, if enacted, could potentially adversely affect
    our future effective tax rate. The proposed changes include
    limiting tax deductions for interest related to unrepatriated
    foreign-source income and modifications to the United States
    foreign tax credit. We cannot determine whether, or in what
    form, legislation implementing the proposals will ultimately be
    enacted. If these or other changes to applicable tax laws are
    enacted, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by
    federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An
    unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax
    expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.
    We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax
    exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with
    respect to our international operations which were restructured
    in 2003, whereby our income from certain

foreign-to-foreign

money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low
    foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax
    rates in the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of
    $522.7 million, including accrued interest and penalties.
    Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the
    issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe
    that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax
    risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an
    issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial
    cost that does not exceed our related reserve, and such
    resolution could have a material affect on our effective tax
    rate, financial position, results of operations and cash flows
    in the current period

and/or

future periods. With respect to these reserves, our income tax
    expense would include



(i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material
    changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e.
    new information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any
    difference from the Company’s tax position as recorded in
    the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue
    during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or
    decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial
    statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash
    flows.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its
    examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax
    returns of First Data Corporation (“First Data”) for
    2003 and 2004, of which Western Union was a part, and issued a
    Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency
    alleges significant additional taxes, interest and penalties
    owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and
    our subsidiaries, and we generally have responsibility for taxes
    associated with these potential Company-related adjustments
    under the tax allocation agreement with First Data executed at
    the time of the Spin-off. We agree with a number of the
    adjustments in the Notice of Deficiency; however, we do not
    agree with the Notice of Deficiency regarding several
    substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional
    tax and penalties due of approximately $114 million. As of
    December 31, 2009, interest on the alleged amounts due for
    unagreed adjustments would be approximately $30 million. A
    substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed
    adjustments relates to our international restructuring, which
    took effect in the fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the
    alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are
    attributable to 2004. On March 20, 2009, we filed a
    petition in the United States Tax Court contesting those
    adjustments with which we do not agree. We believe our overall
    reserves are adequate, including those associated with the
    adjustments alleged in the Notice of Deficiency. If the
    IRS’ position in the Notice of Deficiency is sustained, our
    tax provision related to 2003 and later years would materially
    increase, which could materially impact our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows. See Note 10 to our
    consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of
    this matter.

Acquisitions
    and integration of new businesses create risks and may affect
    operating results.

We occasionally acquire businesses both inside and outside the
    United States. The acquisition and integration of businesses
    involve a number of risks. The core risks involve valuation
    (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently
    limited due diligence) and integration (managing the complex
    process of integrating the acquired company’s people,
    products and services, technology and other assets in an effort
    to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the
    projected synergies of the acquisition). In addition, the need
    in some cases to improve regulatory compliance standards is
    another risk associated with acquiring companies. International
    acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks
    including, for example:

•

managing geographically separated organizations, systems and
    facilities;

•

integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and
    organizational cultures;

•

integrating the acquired technologies into our company;

•

realization of anticipated financial benefits from these
    acquisitions and where necessary, improving internal controls of
    these acquired businesses;

•

complying with regulatory requirements;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign
    countries;

•

difficulty entering new markets with the services of the
    acquired business; and

•

general economic and political conditions, including legal and
    other barriers to cross-border investment in general, or by
    United States companies in particular.

Integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or divert
    resources from, one or more of our businesses and could result
    in the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management’s
    attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in
    connection with an acquisition and the integration of the
    acquired



company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2009, we had $2,143.4 million of
    goodwill comprising approximately 29% of our total assets. An
    impairment review of goodwill is conducted at least once a year
    and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be
    recoverable. If we are unsuccessful in integrating the
    businesses we have acquired or acquire in the future, or if
    these acquired businesses experience declines in operating
    income or cash flows, adverse changes in the business climate,
    or if we are unable to successfully execute our strategy for
    these businesses, we may be required to write down the goodwill
    on our balance sheet associated with these acquisitions, which
    could have an impact on our financial position and results of
    operations in future periods.

Our
    consolidated balance sheet may not contain sufficient amounts or
    types of regulatory capital to meet the changing requirements of
    our various regulators worldwide, which could adversely affect
    our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

We have substantial indebtedness as of December 31, 2009.
    Our regulators expect us to possess sufficient financial
    soundness and strength to adequately support our regulated
    subsidiaries. In addition, although we are not a bank holding
    company for purposes of United States law or the law of any
    other jurisdiction, as a global provider of payments services
    and in light of the changing regulatory environment in various
    jurisdictions, we could become subject to new capital
    requirements introduced or imposed by our regulators that could
    require us to issue securities that would qualify as Tier 1
    regulatory capital under the Basel Committee accords or retain
    earnings over a period of time. Any of these requirements could
    adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

If we
    are unable to maintain our agent, subagent or global business
    payments networks under terms consistent with those currently in
    place, or if our agents or subagents fail to comply with Western
    Union business and technology standards and contract
    requirements or applicable laws and regulations, our business,
    financial position and results of operations would be adversely
    affected.

Most of our

consumer-to-consumer

revenue is derived through our agent network. In addition, our
    international agents may have subagent relationships in which we
    are not directly involved. Transaction volumes at existing agent
    and subagent locations often increase over time and new agents
    and subagents provide us with additional revenue. If agents or
    subagents decide to leave our network, if we are unable to sign
    new agents or maintain our agent network under terms consistent
    with those currently in place, or if our agents are unable to
    maintain relationships with or sign new subagents, our revenue
    and profit growth rates may be adversely affected. Agent
    attrition might occur for a number of reasons, including a
    competitor engaging an agent or an agent’s dissatisfaction
    with its relationship with us or the revenue derived from that
    relationship. In addition, agents may generate fewer
    transactions or less revenue for various reasons, including
    increased competition or changes in the economy. Because an
    agent is a third party that engages in a variety of activities
    in addition to providing our services, it may encounter business
    difficulties unrelated to its provision of our services, which
    could cause the agent to reduce its number of locations, hours
    of operation, or cease doing business altogether.

We rely on our agents’ information systems

and/or

processes to obtain transaction data. If an agent or subagent
    loses information, if there is a significant disruption to the
    information systems of an agent or subagent, or if an agent or
    subagent does not maintain the appropriate controls over their
    systems, we may experience reputational harm which could result
    in losses to the Company.

The types of enterprises that are legally authorized to act as
    our agents vary significantly from one country to another.
    Changes in the laws affecting the kinds of entities that are
    permitted to act as money transfer agents (such as changes in
    requirements for capitalization or ownership) could adversely
    affect our ability to distribute our services and the cost of
    providing such services, both by us and our agents. For example,
    a requirement that a money transfer provider be a bank or other
    highly regulated financial entity could increase significantly
    the cost of providing our services in many countries where that
    requirement does



not exist today or could prevent us from offering our services
    in an affected country. Further, any changes in law that would
    require us to provide directly the money transfer services to
    consumers as opposed to through an agent
    network—effectively changing our business model—could
    significantly adversely impact our ability to provide our
    services,

and/or

the
    cost of our services, in the relevant jurisdiction. Changes
    mandated by laws such as the EU Payment Services Directive,
    which make Western Union responsible for any acts of its agents
    while they are providing the Western Union money transfer
    service, increase our risk of regulatory liability and our costs
    for monitoring our agents’ performance.

Our agents are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements,
    which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject
    to change. A material change in the regulatory requirements
    necessary to offer money transfer services in a jurisdiction
    important to our business could mean increased costs

and/or

operational demands on our agents, which could result in the
    attrition of agents and subagents, a decrease in the number of
    locations at which money transfer services are offered and other
    negative consequences. The regulatory status of our agents could
    affect their ability to offer our services. For example, our
    agents in the United States are considered Money Service
    Businesses, or “MSBs,” under the Bank Secrecy Act. An
    increasing number of banks view MSBs, as a class, as higher risk
    customers for purposes of their anti-money laundering programs.
    Furthermore, some of our agents have had difficulty establishing
    banking relationships due to the banks’ credit policies. If
    a significant number of agents are unable to maintain existing
    or establish new banking relationships, they may not be able to
    continue to offer our services.

Although most of our Orlandi Valuta and Vigo branded agents are
    not exclusive, most of our Western Union branded agents have
    offered our services on an exclusive basis—that is, they
    have agreed by contract not to provide any non-Western Union
    branded money transfer services. While we expect to continue
    signing agents under exclusive arrangements and believe that
    these agreements generally are valid and enforceable, changes in
    laws regulating competition or in the interpretation of those
    laws could undermine our ability to enforce them in the future.
    Recently, several countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
    States, Africa and South Asia have promulgated laws or
    regulations that effectively prohibit payment service providers,
    such as money transfer companies, from agreeing to exclusive
    arrangements with agents in those countries. Certain
    institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and others
    are actively advocating against exclusive arrangements in money
    transfer agent agreements. Advocates for laws prohibiting or
    limiting exclusivity continue to push for enactment of similar
    laws in other jurisdictions. The inability to enter into
    exclusive arrangements or to enforce our exclusivity rights
    under our contracts could adversely affect our operations and
    revenue by, for example, allowing competitors to benefit from
    the goodwill associated with the Western Union brand at our
    agent locations.

We have relationships with more than 6,300 businesses to which
    our consumers can make payments. These relationships are a core
    component of our global business payments services, and we
    derive a substantial portion of our global business payments
    revenue through these relationships. If we are unable to sign
    new relationships or maintain our current relationships under
    terms consistent with those currently in place, our revenue and
    profit growth rates may be adversely affected.

If
    consumers’ confidence in our business or in traditional
    money transfer providers generally deteriorates, our business,
    financial position and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

Our business is built on consumers’ confidence in our
    brands and our ability to provide fast, reliable money transfer
    services. Erosion in consumers’ confidence in our business,
    or in traditional money transfer providers as a means to
    transfer money, could adversely impact transaction volumes which
    would in turn adversely impact our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

A number of factors could adversely affect consumers’
    confidence in our business, or in traditional money transfer
    providers generally, many of which are beyond our control, and
    could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. These
    factors include:

•

changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations that have the
    effect of making it more difficult for consumers to transfer
    money using traditional money transfer providers;



•

actions by federal, state or foreign regulators that interfere
    with our ability to transfer consumers’ money reliably, for
    example, attempts to seize money transfer funds;

•

federal, state or foreign legal requirements, including those
    that require us to provide consumer data to a greater extent
    than is currently required;

•

any significant interruption in our systems, including by fire,
    natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure,
    terrorism, vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer
    viruses; and

•

any breach of our security policies or legal requirements
    resulting in a compromise of consumer data.

Many of our money transfer consumers are migrants. Consumer
    advocacy groups or governmental agencies could consider the
    migrants to be disadvantaged and entitled to protection,
    enhanced consumer disclosure, or other different treatment. If
    governments implement new laws or regulations that limit our
    right to set fees

and/or

foreign exchange spreads, or if consumer advocacy groups are
    able to generate widespread support for positions that are
    detrimental to our business, then our business, financial
    position and results of operations could be adversely affected.
    For example, Pakistan has recently started to subsidize certain
    remittances into the country from Pakistanis working abroad.
    Remittance companies accepting the subsidy would be prohibited
    from charging fees to the sender or receiver. While the
    geographical extent and other details are being determined, it
    is an example of governmental intervention in our industry.

We
    face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents,
    consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our
    business, financial position and results of
    operations.

The vast majority of our global funds transfer business is
    conducted through third-party agents that provide our services
    to consumers at their retail locations. These agents sell our
    services, collect funds from consumers and are required to pay
    the proceeds from these transactions to us. As a result, we have
    credit exposure to our agents. In some countries, our agent
    networks include superagents that establish subagent
    relationships; these agents must collect funds from their
    subagents in order to pay us. We are not insured against credit
    losses, except in certain circumstances related to agent theft
    or fraud. If an agent becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy,
    commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay money order, money
    transfer or payment services proceeds to us, we must nonetheless
    pay the money order, complete the money transfer or payment
    services on behalf of the consumer.

The liquidity of our agents is necessary for our business to
    remain strong and to continue to provide our services. If our
    agents are unable to settle with us in a timely manner, our
    liquidity could be affected.

From time to time, we have made, and may in the future make,
    short term advances and longer term loans to our agents. These
    advances and loans generally are secured by settlement funds
    payable by us to these agents. However, the failure of these
    borrowing agents to repay these advances and loans constitutes a
    credit risk to us.

As a result of our acquisition of Custom House, we are also
    exposed to credit risk relating to foreign currency forward and
    option contracts written by us to our customers. The duration of
    these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. If
    a customer becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits
    fraud or otherwise fails to pay us for the value of these
    contracts, we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting
    position with a financial institution counterparty.

We offer consumers, primarily in the United States, the ability
    to transfer money utilizing their credit or debit card via the
    internet and telephone. Because they are not

face-to-face

transactions, these transactions involve a greater risk of
    fraud. We apply verification and other tools to help
    authenticate transactions and protect against fraud. However,
    these tools are not always successful in protecting us against
    fraud. As the merchant of these transactions, we may bear the
    financial risk of the full amount sent in some of the fraudulent
    transactions. Issuers of credit and debit cards may also incur
    losses due to fraudulent transactions through our distribution
    channels and may elect to block transactions by their
    cardholders in these channels with or without notice. For
    example, during 2007, we received notification from several
    issuing banks that



credit or debit cards issued by them were blocked from
    transacting on westernunion.com. Although these banks
    subsequently have allowed our consumers to use their cards again
    on our website, there is no certainty that these banks will not
    issue a similar restriction in the future, and as a result, we
    may continue to be impacted by notifications such as these in
    the future. Additionally, we may be subject to additional fees
    or penalties if the amount of chargebacks exceeds a certain
    percentage of our transaction volume. Such fees and penalties
    escalate over time if we do not take effective action to reduce
    chargebacks below the threshold, and if chargeback levels are
    not ultimately reduced to acceptable levels, could lead to the
    suspension or revocation of our merchant accounts, which would
    adversely affect our results of operations.

The remittance industry has come under increasing scrutiny from
    government regulators and others in connection with its ability
    to prevent its services from being abused by people seeking to
    defraud others. A competitor of Western Union recently entered
    into a multi-year, multi-million dollar settlement with the
    Federal Trade Commission over this issue. While we believe our
    fraud prevention efforts are effective and comply with
    applicable law and best practices, the ingenuity of criminal
    fraudsters, combined with the potential susceptibility to fraud
    by consumers during economically difficult times, make the
    prevention of consumer fraud a significant and challenging
    problem. Our failure to continue to help prevent such frauds, an
    increase in government enforcement activity or a change in laws
    or their interpretation could pose a material challenge to us.

Interruptions
    in our systems or disruptions in our workforce may have a
    significant effect on our business.

Our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the
    efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer
    information systems and those of our service providers. Any
    significant interruptions could harm our business and reputation
    and result in a loss of consumers. These systems and operations
    could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural
    disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism,
    vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or other
    causes, many of which may be beyond our control or that of our
    service providers. Although we have taken steps to prevent
    systems failure, our measures may not be successful and we may
    experience problems other than system failures. We also may
    experience software defects, development delays, installation
    difficulties and other systems problems, which would harm our
    business and reputation and expose us to potential liability
    which may not be fully covered by our business interruption
    insurance. In addition, any strikes, work stoppages or other
    labor actions by employees who support our systems or perform
    any of our major functions could adversely affect our business.
    Our data applications may not be sufficient to address
    technological advances, regulatory requirements, changing market
    conditions or other developments.

Our
    business, financial position and results of operations could be
    harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating
    agencies.

Currently, each of the major credit rating agencies has given
    our outstanding indebtedness an investment grade rating. If our
    current rating is downgraded, or if a negative outlook is
    provided by a rating agency, our business, financial position
    and results of operations could be adversely affected and
    perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. This
    could adversely affect our relationships with our agents,
    particularly those agents that are financial institutions or
    post offices. In addition, if a downgrade or a negative outlook
    is provided by a rating agency, it could result in regulators
    imposing additional capital and other requirements on us,
    including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated
    subsidiaries to pay dividends. Also, a significant downgrade
    could increase our costs of borrowing money, adversely affecting
    our business, financial position and results of operations.

Western
    Union has been the subject of

class-action

litigation, and remains the subject of other litigation as well
    as consent agreements with or enforcement actions by
    regulators.

Western Union has been the subject of

class-action

litigation in the United States, alleging that its foreign
    exchange rate disclosures failed to adequately inform consumers
    about the revenue that Western Union and its agents derive from
    international remittances. These suits were all settled in or
    before 2004, without an admission of liability, and we have made
    changes in our advertising and consumer forms. It is possible
    that



because of changes in law or future litigation or regulatory
    action, we could be required to modify our disclosures or our
    practices further. These modifications could be costly to
    implement, restrict our ability to advertise or promote our
    services

and/or

limit
    the amount of our foreign exchange income.

In addition, as a company that provides global financial
    services primarily to consumers, we could be subject to future

class-action

lawsuits, other litigation or regulatory action alleging
    violations of consumer protection or other laws. We also are
    subject to claims asserted by consumers based on individual
    transactions.

We recently entered into an agreement and settlement with the
    State of Arizona regarding claims concerning our ability to
    prevent our service from being abused by some users to launder
    money or to facilitate other criminal activity. The agreement
    and settlement resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims
    with the State. In addition to certain investments in, and
    changes to, our anti-money laundering compliance obligations in
    the region during the term of the agreement, we are required to
    fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. The settlement relates to
    a number of lawsuits in which we and the State of Arizona were
    parties. The issues in those cases related to subpoenas for
    transaction data and the State’s attempt to seize money
    transfers originated in states other than Arizona and intended
    for payment in Mexico. Additional civil actions or any criminal
    actions could adversely affect our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

The United States Department of Justice served one of our
    subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents in
    connection with an investigation into money transfers from the
    United States to the Dominican Republic during the last several
    years. Due to the stage of the investigation, we are unable to
    predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss
    or range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of any
    charges that may be brought against us.

Over the past several years, we have entered into consent
    agreements with federal and state authorities, including FinCEN,
    the New York State Banking Department, the California Department
    of Financial Institutions and the Arizona Department of
    Financial Institutions, relating to the Bank Secrecy Act and
    anti-money laundering requirements and related consumer
    identification matters. These agreements required us to pay
    civil penalties and to take certain measures to enhance our
    compliance with recordkeeping, reporting, training and agent
    oversight requirements under applicable state and federal law.
    The consent agreements with the New York State Banking
    Department and the California Department of Financial
    Institutions were lifted during 2007. However, the financial
    services industry and businesses like ours continue to be under
    significant federal and state regulatory scrutiny with respect
    to the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance
    matters. It is possible that as a result of periodic
    examinations or otherwise, we could be subject to deficiency
    findings, fines, criminal penalties, asset seizures or
    enforcement actions that could adversely affect our business,
    financial position and results of operations.

We
    face competition from global and niche or corridor money
    transfer providers, United States and international banks, card
    associations, card-based payments providers and a number of
    other types of service providers, including electronic and
    internet providers. Our continued growth depends on our ability
    to compete effectively in the industry.

Money transfer and global business payments are highly
    competitive industries which include service providers from a
    variety of financial and non-financial business groups. Our
    competitors include banks, credit unions, ATM providers and
    operators, card associations, card-based payments providers such
    as issuers of

e-money,

travel cards or stored-value cards, informal remittance systems,
    web-based services, telephone payment systems (including mobile
    phone networks), postal organizations, retailers, check cashers,
    mail and courier services, currency exchanges and traditional
    money transfer companies. These services are differentiated by
    features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network
    size, hours of operations, loyalty programs, reliability and
    price. Our continued growth depends on our ability to compete
    effectively in these industries. We have made periodic pricing
    decreases in response to competition and to implement our brand
    investment strategy, which includes better meeting consumer
    needs, maximizing market opportunities and strengthening our
    overall competitive positioning. Pricing decreases generally
    reduce margins, but are



done in anticipation that they will result in increased
    transaction volumes. In addition, failure to compete on service
    differentiation could significantly affect our future growth
    potential and results of operations.

As noted above, many of our agents outside the United States are
    national post offices. These entities are usually governmental
    organizations that may enjoy special privileges or protections
    that could allow them to simultaneously develop their own money
    transfer businesses. International postal organizations could
    agree to establish a money transfer network among themselves.
    Due to the size of these organizations and the number of
    locations they have, any such network could represent
    significant competition to us. Because these entities are
    governmental organizations, they may be able to—or be
    required to—offer their money transfer services to the
    public at, near or below their cost of providing such services.

Our
    ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to
    protect our brands and our other intellectual property rights
    and to defend ourselves against potential patent infringement
    claims.

The Western Union brand, which is protected by trademark
    registrations in many countries, is material to our company. The
    loss of the Western Union trademark or a diminution in the
    perceived quality associated with the name would harm our
    business. Similar to the Western Union trademark, the Vigo,
    Orlandi Valuta, Speedpay, Paymap, Equity Accelerator, Just in
    Time EFT, Pago Fácil, Western Union Quick Collect, Quick
    Pay, Quick Cash, Convenience Pay, Custom House and other
    trademarks and service marks are also important to our company
    and a loss of the service mark or trademarks or a diminution in
    the perceived quality associated with these names could harm our
    business.

Our intellectual property rights are an important element in the
    value of our business. Our failure to take appropriate actions
    against those who infringe upon our intellectual property could
    adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business
    either do not recognize intellectual property rights or do not
    protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United
    States. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative
    proceedings in the United States or in foreign countries could
    impair our ability to sell our services or license or protect
    our intellectual property, which could adversely affect our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

We have been, are and in the future may be, subject to claims
    alleging that our technology or business methods infringe
    patents owned by others, both inside and outside the United
    States. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could require us
    to change how we deliver a service, result in significant
    financial consequences, or both, which could adversely affect
    our business, financial position and results of operations.

We
    receive services from third-party vendors that would be
    difficult to replace if those vendors ceased providing such
    services which could cause temporary disruption to our
    business.

Some services relating to our business, such as software
    application support, the development, hosting and maintenance of
    our operating systems, check clearing, and processing of
    returned checks are outsourced to third-party vendors, which
    would be difficult to replace quickly. If our third-party
    vendors were unwilling or unable to provide us with these
    services in the future, our business and operations could be
    adversely affected.

Breaches
    of our information security policies or safeguards could
    adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our
    reputation, business, financial position and results of
    operations.

We collect, transfer and retain consumer, employee and agent
    data as part of our business. These activities are subject to
    laws and regulations in the United States and other
    jurisdictions. The requirements imposed by these laws and
    regulations, which often differ materially among the many
    jurisdictions, are designed to protect the privacy of personal
    information and to prevent that information from being
    inappropriately disclosed. We have developed and maintain
    technical and operational safeguards designed to comply with
    applicable legal requirements. However, despite those
    safeguards, it is possible that hackers, employees acting
    contrary to our policies or others could improperly access our
    systems or improperly obtain or disclose data about our
    consumers, agents

and/or

employees. Further, because some data is collected and



stored by third parties, it is possible that a third party could
    intentionally or negligently disclose personal data in violation
    of law. Also, in some jurisdictions we transfer data related to
    our employees, consumers, agents and potential employees to
    third-party vendors in order to perform due diligence and for
    other reasons. It is possible that a vendor could intentionally
    or inadvertently disclose such data. Any breach of our security
    policies or applicable legal requirements resulting in a
    compromise of consumer, employee or agent data could require us
    to notify impacted individuals, and in some cases regulators, of
    a possible or actual breach, expose us to regulatory enforcement
    action, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to
    litigation

and/or

damage our reputation.

Material
    changes in the market value or liquidity of the securities we
    hold may adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.

As of December 31, 2009, we held $1.2 billion in
    investment securities, substantially all of which are high
    quality investment grade state and municipal debt obligations.
    The majority of this money represents the principal of money
    transfers sent by consumers and money orders issued by us to
    consumers in the United States. Under the PSD in the EU, we
    expect to have a similar portfolio of investment securities,
    which we will manage in a similar manner and under similar
    guidelines as our current portfolio. We regularly monitor our
    credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high
    quality investments and by diversifying our investments. At
    December 31, 2009, the majority of our investment
    securities had credit ratings of “AA-” or better from
    a major credit rating agency. Despite those ratings, it is
    possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the
    future due to any number of factors, including general market
    conditions, credit issues, the viability of the issuer of the
    security, failure by a fund manager to manage the investment
    portfolio consistently with the fund prospectus or increases in
    interest rates. Any such decline in value may adversely affect
    our results of operations and financial condition.

The trust holding the assets of our pension plans has assets
    totaling approximately $275.9 million as of
    December 31, 2009. The fair value of these assets held in
    the trust are compared to the plans’ projected benefit
    obligation to determine the pension liability of
    $124.2 million recorded within “Other
    liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2009. We attempt to mitigate risk through
    diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk on our
    portfolio through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and
    periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it
    is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the
    future due to any number of factors, including general market
    conditions and credit issues. Such declines could have an impact
    on the funded status of our pension plans and future funding
    requirements.

We
    have substantial debt obligations that could restrict our
    operations.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $3.0 billion in consolidated indebtedness, and we may also
    incur additional indebtedness in the future.

Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:

•

limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;

•

increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory
    and industry conditions;

•

limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning
    for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;

•

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds
    available for working capital, capital expenditures,
    acquisitions and other purposes.

There would be adverse tax consequences associated with using
    certain earnings generated outside the United States to pay the
    interest and principal on our indebtedness. Accordingly, this
    portion of our cash flow will be unavailable under normal
    circumstances to service our debt obligations.



Risks
    Relating to the Spin-Off

We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29,
    2006, First Data distributed 100% of its money transfer and
    consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union
    money transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real
    estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data
    shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously
    owned subsidiary.

If the
    Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, First Data
    and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of
    taxes and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to
    indemnify First Data for material taxes pursuant to
    indemnification obligations under the tax allocation
    agreement.

First Data received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the
    effect that, the Spin-off (including certain related
    transactions) qualifies as tax-free to First Data, us and First
    Data stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes
    under sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code, assuming, among other things, the
    accuracy of the representations made by First Data with respect
    to certain matters on which the IRS did not rule. If the factual
    assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling
    request were determined to be untrue or incomplete, then First
    Data and ourselves would not be able to rely on the ruling.

The Spin-off was conditioned upon First Data’s receipt of
    an opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, counsel to First Data, to the
    effect that, with respect to requirements on which the IRS did
    not rule, those requirements would be satisfied. The opinion was
    based on, among other things, certain assumptions and
    representations as to factual matters made by First Data and us
    which, if untrue or incomplete, would jeopardize the conclusions
    reached by counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on
    the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree
    with the opinion.

If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and
    opinion of tax counsel, the Spin-off were determined to be a
    taxable transaction, each holder of First Data common stock who
    received shares of our common stock in connection with the
    Spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable
    distribution in an amount equal to the fair value of our common
    stock received. First Data would recognize taxable gain equal to
    the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by
    First Data in the contribution over First Data’s tax basis
    in the assets contributed to us in the contribution. If First
    Data were unable to pay any taxes for which it is responsible
    under the tax allocation agreement, the IRS might seek to
    collect such taxes from Western Union.

Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualified as a tax-free
    distribution under section 355 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, the Spin-off may result in significant United States
    federal income tax liabilities to First Data if 50% or more of
    First Data’s stock or our stock (in each case, by vote or
    value) is treated as having been acquired, directly or
    indirectly, by one or more persons as part of a plan (or series
    of related transactions) that includes the Spin-off. For
    purposes of this test, any acquisitions, or any understanding,
    arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an
    acquisition, within two years before or after the Spin-off are
    subject to special scrutiny.

With respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be
    imposed as a result of a final determination that is
    inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the
    Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant
    tax opinion) (“Spin-off Related Taxes”), we, one of
    our affiliates or any person that, after the Spin-off, is an
    affiliate thereof, will be liable to First Data for any such
    Spin-off Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by
    or with respect to us. In addition, we will also be liable for
    50% of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that would not have
    been imposed but for the existence of both an action by us and
    an action by First Data or (ii) where we and First Data
    each take actions that, standing alone, would have resulted in
    the imposition of such Spin-off Related Taxes. We may be
    similarly liable if we breach certain representations or
    covenants set forth in the tax allocation agreement. If we are
    required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result
    of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would
    have an adverse effect on our business, financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

PROPERTIES

Properties
    and Facilities

As of December 31, 2009, we have offices in approximately
    50 countries, which includes three owned facilities and
    approximately 25 United States and 350 international leased
    properties. Our owned facilities include our corporate
    headquarters located in Englewood, Colorado.

Our owned and leased facilities are used for operational, sales
    and administrative purposes in support of both our

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments segments and are all currently
    being utilized. In certain locations, our offices include
    customer service centers, where our employees answer operational
    questions from agents and customers. Our office in Dublin,
    Ireland serves as our international headquarters.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our
    current business; however, we periodically review our facility
    requirements and may acquire new facilities to meet the needs of
    our businesses or consolidate and dispose of or sublet
    facilities which are no longer required.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are party to a variety of legal proceedings that arise in the
    normal course of our business. While the results of these legal
    proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management
    believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial position.

Dividend
    Policy

On December 9, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable on
    December 30, 2009 to shareholders of record on
    December 21, 2009. On December 11, 2008, our Board of
    Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.04 per share
    payable on December 31, 2008 to shareholders of record on
    December 22, 2008. The declaration and amount of future
    dividends will be determined by our Board of Directors and will
    depend on our financial condition, earnings, capital
    requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and any
    other factors that our Board of Directors believes are relevant.
    As a holding company with no material assets other than the
    capital stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends
    in future periods will be dependent on our receiving dividends
    from our operating subsidiaries. Several of our operating
    subsidiaries are subject to financial services regulations and
    their ability to pay dividends may be restricted.

On February 25, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable on
    March 31, 2010 to shareholders of record on March 19,
    2010.



ITEM 6.

SELECTED
    FINANCIAL DATA

The financial information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for periods ending on or after September 29, 2006 is
    presented on a consolidated basis and includes the accounts of
    the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries. On
    September 29, 2006, First Data Corporation (“First
    Data”) distributed 100% of its money transfer and consumer
    payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money
    transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real
    estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data
    shareholders (“Spin-off”). The Spin-off by First Data
    of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses became
    effective on September 29, 2006 through a distribution of
    100% of the common stock of The Western Union Company to the
    holders of record of First Data’s common stock (the
    “Distribution”). The financial information for the
    periods presented prior to the Distribution is presented on a
    combined basis and represents those entities that were
    ultimately transferred to the Company as part of the Spin-off.
    The assets and liabilities presented have been reflected on a
    historical basis, as prior to the Distribution such assets and
    liabilities presented were 100% owned by First Data. The
    financial statements for the periods presented prior to the
    Distribution do not include all of the actual expenses that
    would have been incurred had Western Union been a stand-alone
    entity during the periods presented and do not reflect Western
    Union’s combined results of operations, financial position
    and cash flows had Western Union been a stand-alone company
    during the periods presented.

Our selected historical financial data are not necessarily
    indicative of our future financial position, future results of
    operations or future cash flows.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction
    with our historical consolidated financial statements and the
    notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual
    Report on

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with
    the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those
    statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Certain statements contained in the Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical
    facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates,
    assumptions and projections about our industry, business and
    future financial results. Our actual results could differ
    materially from the results contemplated by these
    forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including
    those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-looking
    Statements.”

Overview

We are a leading provider of money transfer services, operating
    in two business segments:

•

Consumer-to-consumer

money transfer services, provided primarily through a global
    network of third-party agents using our multi-currency,
    real-time money transfer processing systems. This service is
    available for international cross-border transfers—that is,
    the transfer of funds from one country to another—and, in
    certain countries, intra-country transfers—that is, money
    transfers from one location to another in the same country.

•

Global business payments (formerly

consumer-to-business),

which allows for the processing of payments from consumers or
    businesses to other businesses. Our business payments service
    allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations,
    including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers,
    financial service providers, government agencies and other
    businesses. On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada-based
    Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom House”), a provider of
    international

business-to-business

payment services, which is included in this segment. Custom
    House facilitates cross-border, cross-currency payment
    transactions. While we continue to pursue further international
    expansion of our offerings in this segment, the segment’s
    revenue was primarily generated in the United States during all
    periods presented.

Businesses not considered part of the segments described above
    are categorized as “Other” and primarily includes our
    money order services, and represented 2% or less of consolidated
    revenue during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007. Prior to October 1, 2009, our money orders were
    issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc. (“IPS”), a
    subsidiary of First Data Corporation (“First Data”),
    to consumers at retail locations primarily in the United States
    and Canada. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the
    responsibility for issuing money orders.

Also included in “Other” are expenses incurred in
    connection with the development of certain new service
    offerings, including costs to develop mobile money transfer
    services, new prepaid service offerings and costs incurred in
    connection with mergers and acquisitions.

Significant
    Financial and Other Highlights

Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 included:

•

We generated $5,083.6 million in total consolidated
    revenues, representing a

year-over-year

decline of 4%. This decline was partially offset by the
    acquisition of Custom House, which contributed
    $30.8 million to revenue for 2009.

•

We generated $1,282.7 million in consolidated operating
    income compared to $1,355.0 million for the comparable
    period in the prior year, representing a decrease of 5%.
    Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009
    included an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from an
    anticipated agreement and settlement which resolves all
    outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of



Arizona and requires us to fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona (the “settlement
    accrual”). The settlement agreement was signed on
    February 11, 2010. Results for 2008 included
    $82.9 million in restructuring and related expenses.

•

Our operating income margin was 25% during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, resulting in a

year-over-year

decline of 1%. The current year results included the settlement
    accrual, while the prior year results included the restructuring
    and related expenses mentioned above.

•

Consolidated net income during 2009 was $848.8 million,
    representing a decline of 8% from 2008. The current results
    included the settlement accrual of $53.9 million, net of
    tax, while the prior year results included $51.6 million in
    restructuring and related expenses, net of tax.

•

Our consumers transferred $71 billion in

consumer-to-consumer

principal, of which $65 billion related to cross-border
    principal, which represented a decrease of 3% in both

consumer-to-consumer

principal and cross-border principal over the prior year.

•

Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were
    $1,218.1 million, a decrease of 3% over 2008.

•

We completed two acquisitions in the year ended
    December 31, 2009. In February 2009, we completed the
    acquisition of the money transfer business of one of our largest
    agents, European-based FEXCO, for $243.6 million, including
    $157.4 million of cash consideration. As described earlier,
    we acquired Custom House in September 2009 for cash
    consideration of $371.0 million.

Factors that we believe are important to our long-term success
    include accelerating profitable growth in our existing

consumer-to-consumer

business, innovating to provide new products and services,
    including electronic channels, to our intended consumer,
    expanding our global business payments segment to other markets
    across the world through our cross-border, cross-currency
    payment service offerings and improving our profitability by
    leveraging our scale, reducing costs and effectively utilizing
    capital. Significant factors affecting our financial position
    and results of operations include:

•

Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our
    businesses. Transaction volume in our

consumer-to-consumer

segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the
    international migrant population and individual needs to
    transfer funds in emergency situations. As noted elsewhere in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions
    in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities
    including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws,
    economic development patterns or political events, could
    adversely affect our transaction volume. For discussion on how
    these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the

consumer-to-consumer

segment discussion below.

•

Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge
    consumers, the principal sent per transaction and by the
    variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the
    rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. We
    intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions
    and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where
    appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and
    including competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign
    exchange spreads generally reduce margins, but are done in
    anticipation that they will result in increased transaction
    volumes and increased revenues over time.

•

A majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent
    commissions, which are generally variable and fluctuate as
    revenues fluctuate.

•

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and
    foreign exchange revenue. The impact to earnings per share is
    less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses
    and our foreign currency hedging program.



Spin-off
    from First Data

We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29,
    2006, First Data distributed 100% of its money transfer and
    consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union
    money transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real
    estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data
    shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously
    owned subsidiary.

Basis
    of Presentation

The financial statements in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts
    of our company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our
    company’s segments have been eliminated.

Adoption
    of Accounting Standards

Business
    Combinations

We adopted a new accounting standard related to accounting for
    business combinations and noncontrolling interests effective
    January 1, 2010. Under the new guidance,
    acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred,
    restructuring costs generally are expensed in periods subsequent
    to the acquisition date, and changes in estimates for deferred
    tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax
    uncertainties after the measurement period, which is one year or
    less, impact income tax expense in the period of change. For
    business combinations achieved in stages, the new guidance
    requires that we re-measure any noncontrolling equity
    investments in the acquiree to fair value as of the acquisition
    date immediately before obtaining control. All re-measurement
    gains and losses are recognized in earnings and the total fair
    values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and any
    noncontrolling interests are recorded in the consolidated
    balance sheet.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We monitor our investments in debt securities to determine if
    these securities are in an

other-than-temporary

impairment position under new accounting guidance introduced in
    2009. Factors that could indicate an impairment exists include,
    but are not limited to: earnings performance, changes in credit
    rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or economic
    environment of the asset. If potential impairments exist, we
    assess whether or not we intend to sell the debt security, and
    whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to
    sell it, before its anticipated recovery. We had no material

other-than-temporary

impairments during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007.

Components
    of Revenues and Expenses

The following briefly describes the components of revenues and
    expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income.
    Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in
    Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies” in our consolidated financial statements.

Transaction fees

—Transaction fees are charged for
    sending money transfers and for global business payments
    services.

Consumer-to-consumer

transaction fees generally vary according to the principal
    amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which
    the funds are sent. Transaction fees represented 79% of Western
    Union’s total consolidated revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Foreign exchange revenue

—In certain consumer money
    transfer and global business payments transactions involving
    different currencies, we generate revenue based on the
    difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer
    and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire
    currency. Foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been
    primarily driven by growth in international cross-currency
    transactions. As a result of the acquisition of Custom House,
    our foreign exchange revenues have increased and we expect this
    trend to continue in 2010. Foreign exchange revenue represented
    18% of Western Union’s total consolidated revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.



Commission and other revenues

—Commission and other
    revenues primarily consist of commissions and fees we receive in
    connection with the sale of money orders, enrollment fees
    received when consumers enroll in our Equity
    Accelerator

®

program (a recurring mortgage payment service program) and
    investment income primarily derived from interest generated on
    money transfer, money order and payment services settlement
    assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such
    assets. As described above, prior to October 1, 2009, our
    money orders were issued by IPS, from whom we received a
    commission. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the
    responsibility for issuing money orders and no longer receive a
    commission from IPS. We now recognize fees and investment income
    derived from interest generated on money order settlement assets
    as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets
    similar to our money transfer and payment services settlement
    assets. Commission and other revenues represented 3% of our
    total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31,
    2009.

Cost of services—

Cost of services primarily consists
    of agent commissions, which represent approximately 75% of total
    cost of services, and expenses for call centers, settlement
    operations, and related information technology costs. Expenses
    within these functions include personnel, software, equipment,
    telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and
    other expenses incurred in connection with providing money
    transfer and other payment services.

Selling, general and administrative

—Selling, general
    and administrative, or “SG&A,” primarily consists
    of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and
    administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and
    promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses.

Interest income

—Interest income consists of interest
    earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement
    obligations and in connection with a loan made to several
    existing agents.

Interest expense

—Interest expense represents
    interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings,
    including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps.

Derivative (losses)/gains, net

—Represents the
    portion of the change in fair value of foreign currency
    accounting hedges that is excluded from the measurement of
    effectiveness, which includes (a) differences between
    changes in forward rates and spot rates and (b) gains or
    losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during
    periods in which the instrument is not designated as a hedge.
    Although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are
    deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until
    settlement (i.e., spot rate changes), the remaining portion of
    changes in value are recognized in income as they occur.
    Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in
    foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate
    exposures on settlement activities of our

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer business or on certain foreign currency
    denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with
    those foreign currency forward contracts are included in
    selling, general and administrative expenses. Derivative gains
    and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency
    forward and option contracts used in our international

business-to-business

payments operations. The impact of these contracts is classified
    within foreign exchange revenue in the consolidated statements
    of income.

Other income, net

—Other income, net is comprised
    primarily of equity earnings from equity method investments and
    other income and expenses.

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion of our consolidated results of
    operations and segment results refers to the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same
    period in 2007. The results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of
    operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning
    certain components of the consolidated statements of income. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our
    company’s segments have been eliminated.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an
    accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated agreement and
    settlement with the State of Arizona. On February 11, 2010,
    we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all
    outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and requires
    us to fund a



multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. While this item was
    identifiable to our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the chief operating decision maker
    (“CODM”) for purposes of assessing segment performance
    and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For
    additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses.

We incurred expenses of $82.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 for restructuring and related activities,
    which were not allocated to our segments. While these items were
    identifiable to our segments, they were not included in the
    measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for
    purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making
    with respect to resource allocation. For additional information
    on restructuring and related activities refer to “Operating
    expenses overview.”

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred a
    $22.3 million accelerated stock-based compensation vesting
    charge related to the acquisition of First Data by an affiliate
    of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (“KKR”)
    which was allocated to our segments. For additional information
    refer to “Operating expenses overview.”

    operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007.

Revenues
    overview

    compared to 2008

The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue
    were contributed by our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which is discussed in greater detail in “Segment
    Discussion.” Consolidated revenue declined 4% during the
    year ended December 31, 2009. The revenue decline was
    attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction
    growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix, product mix
    including a higher percentage of revenue earned from
    intra-country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction
    than cross-border transactions, and price decreases. Also
    impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the
    United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies
    for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue
    by approximately 3%, as discussed below.

The Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia
    (“EMEASA”) region of our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which represented 45% of our total consolidated revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue
    declines and slower transaction growth rates during the year
    ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding
    period in the prior year. The revenue declines were driven by
    most of the same factors discussed above. The acquisition of
    FEXCO’s money transfer business did not have an impact on
    our revenue as we were already recognizing 100% of the revenue
    arising from money transfers originating at FEXCO’s
    locations.

The Americas region (including North America, Latin America, the
    Caribbean and South America) of our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which represented 32% of our total consolidated revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue
    and transaction declines due to the overall weak United States
    economy. Our Americas results were further impacted by pricing
    reductions taken in the United States in the fourth quarter of
    2009 which improved our transaction volumes, but contributed to
    the decline in revenue.

The global business payments segment, which is discussed in
    greater detail in “Segment Discussion,” also
    experienced revenue declines during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding prior
    period. Revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic
    situation in the United States, which resulted in a revenue
    decline in our United States cash and electronic bill payments
    businesses. Offsetting these declines in 2009 were the results
    of our Custom House acquisition, which contributed
    $30.8 million of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 over 2008 primarily due to foreign
    exchange revenue from Custom House. Excluding the impact of
    Custom House, foreign exchange revenue decreased at a rate
    relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our
    international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar
    have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign
    exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 of
    $119.5 million over the previous year, net of foreign
    currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been
    constant currency rates. The impact to earnings per share during
    the period was less than the revenue impact due to the
    translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging
    program. The majority of our foreign currency exchange rate
    exposure is related to the EMEASA region.

    compared to 2007

Consolidated revenue growth of 8% during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 was primarily driven by revenue growth
    internationally, particularly in the EMEASA region, due to
    increased money transfers at existing agent locations, and to a
    lesser extent, money transfers at new agent locations and due to
    the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues
    into the United States dollar, specifically the euro, discussed
    below. Our international

consumer-to-consumer

transactions that were originated outside of the United States
    also continued to experience strong revenue and transaction
    growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the
    corresponding period in the prior year.



However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue was impacted
    by the weakening global economy and its effect on Western Union
    customers. In the fourth quarter, transaction growth rates
    slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of 2008.
    In addition, the amount of money remitted per transaction
    declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth
    quarter of 2007. These factors resulted in less transaction fee
    and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008
    compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in a benefit to
    transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of
    $96 million, over the previous year, net of foreign
    currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been
    constant currency rates. The positive impact to operating profit
    derived from foreign currency exchange rates increasing against
    the United States dollar during the year was offset by the
    impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign
    currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of
    fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness
    for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a
    minimal impact to overall earnings per share. The benefit in the
    first three quarters of 2008 was slightly offset by the negative
    impact to

consumer-to-consumer

transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 due to the strengthening of the United States
    dollar relative to certain other currencies, including the euro.
    However, the impact to our operating income was positive to the
    fourth quarter of 2008 due to our derivative hedges.

Our Asia Pacific (“APAC”) region also experienced
    strong transaction and revenue growth during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding previous
    period, including growth contributed by the inbound market to
    the Philippines. Revenue growth slowed in APAC during the fourth
    quarter 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, in part due to
    the weakening global economy described previously and the
    decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs
    that typically make purchases in China.

Within our Americas region, our United States to Mexico, United
    States outbound and transactions in our domestic (between and
    within the United States and Canada) businesses continued to be
    impacted by the overall weakening in the United States economy.
    The immigration debate and market softness, in part due to the
    slowdown in the construction industry, began adversely impacting
    the United States businesses in the second quarter of 2006. We
    responded to these factors by launching distribution, pricing,
    advertising, promotion and community outreach initiatives in
    2006 and 2007. Although the United States businesses revenue
    decline experienced in 2008 moderated compared with 2007, we
    experienced increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of
    2008 compared to the third quarter of 2008, due to the weakening
    in the United States economy.

Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 over the corresponding previous period,
    due to an increase in cross-currency transactions primarily as a
    result of growth in international

consumer-to-consumer

transactions. As described above, foreign exchange revenue also
    benefited during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared
    to 2007 from the strengthening of other currencies most notably
    the euro, against the United States dollar.

Operating
    expenses overview

The following factors impacted both cost of services and
    selling, general and administrative expenses during the periods
    presented:

•

Restructuring and Related Activities—

For the year
    ended December 31, 2008, restructuring and related expenses
    of $62.8 million and $20.1 million are classified
    within “cost of services” and “selling, general
    and administrative” expenses, respectively, in the
    consolidated statements of income. These restructuring and
    related expenses are associated with the closure of our
    facilities in Missouri and Texas and other reorganization plans
    executed in 2008. No expenses were recognized for these
    restructurings in 2009.

2007 Stock Compensation Charge

—At the time of the
    Spin-off, First Data converted stock options, restricted stock
    awards, and restricted stock units (collectively,
    “stock-based awards”) of First Data stock held by
    Western Union and First Data employees. Both Western Union and
    First Data



employees received converted Western Union stock-based awards.
    All converted stock-based awards, which had not vested prior to
    September 24, 2007, were subject to the terms and
    conditions applicable to the original First Data stock-based
    awards, including change of control provisions which require
    full vesting upon a change of control of First Data.
    Accordingly, upon the completion of the acquisition of First
    Data on September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of KKR, all of
    these remaining converted unvested Western Union stock-based
    awards vested. In connection with this accelerated vesting, we
    incurred a non-cash pre-tax charge of $22.3 million during
    the third quarter of 2007. Approximately one-third of this
    charge was recorded within “cost of services” and
    two-thirds was recorded within “selling, general and
    administrative” expenses in the consolidated statements of
    income.

Cost of
    services

Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31,
    2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008 primarily due
    to agent commissions, which decreased due to revenue declines,
    as well as reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of
    FEXCO and other selective

consumer-to-consumer

commission initiatives. Also impacting cost of services was the
    strengthening of the United States dollar for most of 2009
    compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a
    favorable impact on the translation of our expenses, and
    restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009
    and the related 2009 cost savings. These costs were offset by
    incremental operating costs, including increased technology
    costs and costs associated with Custom House. Cost of services
    as a percentage of revenue was 57% and 59% for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in
    cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in
    2008 was generally due to reduced commissions resulting from the
    acquisition of FEXCO and selective

consumer-to-consumer

agent commission initiatives, restructuring costs incurred in
    2008 which did not recur in 2009 and the related 2009 cost
    savings, offset somewhat by incremental operating costs,
    including increased technology costs and costs associated with
    Custom House.

In addition to the restructuring costs described above, cost of
    services increased for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the corresponding period in 2007 primarily due to
    agent commissions which increase as revenues increase. Cost of
    services as a percentage of revenue was 59% and 57% for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    the corresponding period in 2007 was primarily due to
    restructuring and related expenses of $62.8 million as
    described above, and the shift in our business mix reflecting
    stronger growth from our international

consumer-to-consumer

business, which carries higher cost of services compared to our
    United States originated businesses. Selected

consumer-to-consumer

international agent commissions have been lowered but were
    partially offset by certain higher commissions in the United
    States. In addition, a higher percentage of our global business
    payments services were generated from our United States
    electronic-based payments and payments related to Pago
    Fácil, each of which had higher cost of services as a
    percentage of revenue compared to our United States cash-based
    payments business. The increase was partially offset by lower
    stock compensation charges for the year ended December 31,
    2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007, as described
    above and below, that did not recur in 2008.

Selling,
    general and administrative

SG&A increased for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the same period in the prior year due to the
    settlement accrual described below, incremental costs associated
    with the acquisitions of FEXCO and Custom House including costs
    related to evaluating and closing these acquisitions and other
    increased operating expenses, offset by better leveraging of our
    marketing expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in 2008
    which did not recur in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an
    accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated agreement and
    settlement with the State of Arizona. On February 11, 2010,
    we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all
    outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and requires
    us to fund a



multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. The accrual includes
    amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs
    associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the
    agreement and settlement, we expect to make certain investments
    in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico
    border and to engage a monitor of that program, which are
    expected to cost up to $23 million over the next two to
    four years.

SG&A expenses increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior
    year due to higher employee compensation expenses and
    restructuring and related expenses of $20.1 million, offset
    by better leveraging of our marketing expenses as well as lower
    stock compensation charges in 2008, as described above.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    marketing related expenditures, principally classified within
    SG&A, were approximately 5% to 6% of revenue. Marketing
    related expenditures include advertising, events, loyalty
    programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing
    activities. When making decisions with respect to marketing
    investments, we review opportunities for advertising and other
    marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for
    fee adjustments, as discussed in “Segment Discussion,”
    for

consumer-to-consumer

revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the
    return on these investments.

Interest
    income

Interest income decreased during both the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 and the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower
    short-term interest rates and lower average interest-bearing
    cash balances.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense decreased for both the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 and the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower short-term
    interest rates on certain debt with floating interest rates. In
    addition, lower average borrowing balances impacted the decline
    in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the previous year.

Derivative
    (losses)/gains, net

Changes in derivative (losses)/gains, net were immaterial for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior
    year. Volatility in foreign currency forward rates compared to
    spot rates, primarily related to the euro, resulted in the
    decrease to income for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to 2007.

Other
    income, net

Other income, net decreased during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to a
    $12 million reserve taken against our receivable from the
    Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. and a decline in
    earnings on our equity method investments in 2009, primarily as
    a result of the absence of equity method earnings for FEXCO
    subsequent to the acquisition date. Changes in other income, net
    during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the
    previous corresponding year was primarily attributable to
    fluctuations in equity earnings from equity method investments.

Income
    taxes

Our effective tax rates on pretax income were 25.0%, 25.8% and
    29.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. We continue to benefit from an increasing
    proportion of profits being foreign-derived and therefore taxed
    at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in
    the United States. In addition, during 2008, we implemented
    additional foreign tax efficient strategies consistent with our
    overall tax planning which impacted our effective tax rate for
    all subsequent periods.



Recent proposed changes to United States tax laws, if enacted,
    could potentially adversely affect our future effective tax
    rate. We are closely monitoring the proposed changes, and the
    potential effect on our future effective tax rate will depend on
    the final form of any new law.

We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax
    exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with
    respect to our international operations restructured in 2003,
    whereby our income from certain

foreign-to-foreign

money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low
    foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax
    rates in the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of
    $522.7 million, including accrued interest and penalties.
    Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the
    issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe
    that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax
    risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an
    issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial
    cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to
    these reserves, our income tax expense would include
    (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material
    changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new
    information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any
    difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial
    statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the
    period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease
    income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in
    future periods and could impact our operating cash flows.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    completed its examination of the United States federal
    consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004,
    of which we are a part, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in
    December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency alleges significant
    additional taxes, interest and penalties owed with respect to a
    variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries, and we
    generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these
    potential Western Union-related adjustments under the tax
    allocation agreement with First Data executed at the time of the
    Spin-off. We agree with a number of the adjustments in the
    Notice of Deficiency; however, we do not agree with the Notice
    of Deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments
    representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of
    approximately $114 million. As of December 31, 2009,
    interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments
    would be approximately $30 million. A substantial part of
    the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates
    to our international restructuring, which took effect in the
    fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the alleged amounts due
    related to such restructuring largely are attributable to 2004.
    On March 20, 2009, we filed a petition in the United States
    Tax Court contesting those adjustments with which we do not
    agree. We believe our overall reserves are adequate, including
    those associated with adjustments alleged in the Notice of
    Deficiency. If the IRS’ position in the Notice of
    Deficiency is sustained, our tax provision related to 2003 and
    later years would materially increase, which could materially
    impact our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

Earnings
    per share

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    basic earnings per share were $1.21, $1.26 and $1.13,
    respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.21, $1.24
    and $1.11, respectively. Unvested shares of restricted stock are
    excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
    share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
    outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised
    and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were
    37.5 million, 8.0 million and 10.4 million,
    respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of
    Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share
    calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was
    anti-dilutive. The increase in anti-dilutive shares in 2009 was
    primarily due to the majority of our outstanding options having
    an exercise price higher than our average market price for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

Of the 42.8 million, 43.6 million and
    59.4 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our
    common stock as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, approximately 40%, 47% and 58%, respectively, were
    held by employees of First Data.

Earnings per share decreased for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding previous
    period as a result of the previously described factors impacting
    net income, offset by lower weighted-



average shares outstanding. Earnings per share increased during
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 due to
    the increased net income as a result of the previously described
    factors and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.
    The lower number of shares outstanding was driven by stock
    repurchases exceeding stock option exercises in both 2009 and
    2008 compared to the corresponding periods.

Segment
    Discussion

We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we
    serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two
    segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups,
    distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments. Businesses not considered part of
    these segments are categorized as “Other.”

The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by,
    our CODM are computed in accordance with the following
    principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments
    primarily based on a percentage of the segments’ revenue
    compared to total revenue.

•

Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions
    are included in “Other.”

•

An accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated agreement
    and settlement with the State of Arizona recorded during the
    year ended December 31, 2009 has not been allocated to the
    segments. On February 11, 2010, we signed this agreement
    and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and
    claims with the State and requires us to fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. While this item was
    identifiable to our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on the settlement
    accrual, refer to “Operating expenses overview.”

•

Restructuring and related activities of $82.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 have not been allocated to
    the segments. While these items were identifiable to our
    segments, they were not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on restructuring and
    related activities refer to “Operating expenses
    overview.”

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded.

The following table sets forth the components of segment
    revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

In determining the revenue and transaction growth rates under
    the regional view in the above table, the geographic split is
    determined based upon the region where the money transfer is
    initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For
    transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split
    the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with
    each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and
    paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions
    are attributed to that region.

When referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for
    individual countries in the following discussion, all
    transactions to, from and within those countries, and 100% of
    the revenue associated with each transaction to, from and within
    those countries are included. The countries of India and China
    combined represented approximately 7%, 6% and 5% of consolidated
    Western Union revenues during the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No individual country, other
    than the United States, represented more than approximately 6%,
    7% and 7% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Transaction
    fees and foreign exchange revenue

    compared to 2008

Consumer-to-consumer

money transfer revenue declined 4% on transaction growth of 4%
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008. The revenue
    decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing
    transaction growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix,
    product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from
    intra-country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction
    than cross-border transactions, and price decreases. Also
    impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the
    United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies
    for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue
    by approximately 2%, as discussed below. Our international

consumer-to-consumer

business experienced a revenue decline of 1% on transaction
    growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our
    international business represents all transactions other than
    transactions between and within the United States and Canada and
    transactions to and from Mexico. Our international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States also experienced revenue
    declines on transaction increases for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 as a result of the same factors described
    above.

Revenue in our EMEASA region declined 1% during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due
    to most of the same factors discussed above. Our largest
    European markets experienced revenue declines during most of the
    year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period
    in 2008. Our money transfer business to India for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 versus the same period in 2008 continued
    to grow with transaction growth of 22% and revenue growth of
    11%. Revenue and transaction growth for both India and the Gulf
    States slowed throughout the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to 2008. Due to the economic conditions in the Gulf
    States, transaction growth rates declined to single digits in
    the fourth quarter and we expect slowing transaction growth to
    impact 2010.

Americas revenue and transactions declined for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.
    Contributing to the overall decline in the Americas region was
    the domestic business (transactions between and within the
    United States and Canada) which experienced a revenue decline of
    14% on a transaction decline of 5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The repositioning of the domestic
    business, including pricing reductions taken in the United
    States in the fourth quarter of 2009, improved our Americas and
    domestic transaction volumes, but contributed to the decline in
    revenue. Our Mexico business also contributed to the overall
    decline in the Americas region with a revenue decline of 15% on
    a transaction decline of 12% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Our United States domestic and Mexico
    business revenue declined due to the weak economy in the United
    States. Our Mexico revenues were also impacted by our closure of
    certain Vigo branded agents, substantially all of which were
    small retailers, due to credit concerns. However, the decline in
    revenue for our United States outbound business moderated in the
    fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the previous nine months of
    2009 as a result of transaction growth experienced in the fourth
    quarter of 2009.

Our APAC revenue increased 5% on transaction growth of 18% for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same
    period in 2008. The APAC region’s revenues have been
    impacted by translating foreign currency denominated revenues
    into the United States dollar, as further described below, as
    well as moderating transaction growth. China revenue grew 1% on
    4% transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Foreign exchange revenue decreased for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 over the corresponding previous period at
    a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue
    from our international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have
    resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 of
    $101.3 million over the same period in the previous year,
    net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had
    there been constant currency rates. The majority of our exposure
    is related to the EMEASA region.

We have historically implemented and will likely implement
    future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign
    exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth
    opportunities and competitive



factors. Fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally
    reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will
    result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues
    over time. For the year ended December 31, 2009, such fee
    decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately 2% of
    total Western Union revenue compared to 1% and 3% for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature
    agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only
    marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation.
    Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location,
    is often experienced as locations mature. We believe that new
    agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number
    of locations available to send and receive money. We generally
    refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being
    initiated (versus paid) as “send locations” and to the
    balance of locations as “receive locations.” Send
    locations are the engine that drives

consumer-to-consumer

revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than
    receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations
    is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global
    distribution and convenience for consumers. The number of send
    and receive transactions at an agent location can vary
    significantly due to such factors as customer demographics
    around the location, migration patterns, the location’s
    class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location
    has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and
    competition. Each of the 410,000 agent locations in our agent
    network is capable of providing one or more of our services;
    however, not every location completes a transaction in a given
    period. For example, as of December 31, 2009, more than 85%
    of agent locations in the United States, Canada and Western
    Europe (representing at least one of our three money transfer
    brands: Western
    Union

®

,

    Orlandi
    Valuta

®

and
    Vigo

sm

)

    experienced money transfer activity in the previous
    12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other
    areas where there are primarily receive locations, approximately
    70% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the
    previous 12 months. We periodically review locations to
    determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer
    transactions.

    compared to 2007

Consumer-to-consumer

money transfer revenue growth was 9% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 over the same period in 2007. This
    increase was driven by revenue growth of 13% in our
    international business on transaction growth of 17%. Our
    international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States also continued to
    experience strong revenue growth for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as a result of strong transaction growth.

However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue was impacted
    by the weakening global economy and its effect on Western Union
    customers. In the fourth quarter, transaction growth rates
    slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of 2008.
    In addition, the amount of money remitted per transaction
    declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth
    quarter of 2007. These factors resulted in less transaction fee
    and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008
    compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.

Revenue growth in our EMEASA region was 16% on transaction
    growth of 23% for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the
    same period in 2007. The growth in our EMEASA region during the
    year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily driven by
    transaction growth and the impact of translating foreign
    currency denominated revenues into the United States dollar,
    specifically the euro, as further described below. Contributing
    to the growth in the EMEASA region was strong transaction growth
    of over 60% in our money transfer business to India for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding
    period in 2007, resulting in revenue growth of over 45%. Over
    the same period, revenue growth in the Gulf States continued to
    be strong. However, revenue growth in some European markets
    during the year ended December 31, 2008 slowed over the
    previous year, especially during the fourth quarter of 2008 as
    certain countries within Europe, such as Spain, experienced
    declines in the housing industry and rising unemployment.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in a benefit
    to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of
    $96 million, over the previous year, net of foreign
    currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been
    constant currency rates. The positive impact to operating profit
    derived from foreign



currency exchange rates increasing against the United States
    dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign
    currency derivative losses for those foreign currency
    derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair
    value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for
    these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a
    minimal impact to overall earnings per share.

Americas revenue declined 1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in
    2007 but transactions grew 2% for the same period. The United
    States domestic and the United States outbound revenue
    continued to decline, due to the overall weakening in the United
    States economy and rising unemployment, for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Within the Americas region, revenue
    declines in our domestic business, which represents
    approximately 10% of consolidated revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, continued to occur due to the factors
    described above. Although the domestic and United States
    outbound revenue declines experienced in 2008 moderated compared
    to those experienced in 2007, we did experience increased
    revenue declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the
    third quarter of 2008, due to the further weakening in the
    United States economy.

Domestic revenue declined 6% on transaction declines of 3% for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the
    corresponding period in 2007. In addition, United States
    telephone money transfer revenues continued to decline, and
    website money transfer revenues were flat for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Revenue in our Mexico business was down 2% on transaction
    declines of 1% for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007. The Mexico business
    continued to be impacted by the weakening in the United States
    economy, noted earlier, with such declines increasing in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. During a few weeks in the fourth quarter
    2008, the value of the Mexican peso decreased dramatically
    against the United States dollar and, as a result, we
    experienced a spike in transactions as United States senders
    took advantage of the more favorable exchange rates. As the
    devaluation of the peso was sudden and unusual, we needed to
    acquire pesos at less favorable rates in order to meet the
    demand for immediate payout in Mexico, which impacted the
    overall decline in revenue by less than $5 million.

Revenue and transaction growth in the APAC region for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007
    was driven by strong inbound growth to the region, especially to
    the Philippines. China revenue and transactions grew at 13% and
    11% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the
    corresponding period in 2007, respectively. Revenue growth rates
    slowed to China during the third quarter of 2008, with revenue
    declining in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same
    period in 2007, in part due to the weakening economic situation
    described previously and the decline in high revenue
    transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make
    purchases in China.

Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior
    year due to an increase in cross-currency transactions primarily
    as a result of growth in international

consumer-to-consumer

transactions. As described above, foreign exchange revenue also
    benefited during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared
    to 2007 from the exchange rate between other currencies against
    the United States dollar, despite the negative impact of
    currency rate fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Operating
    income

    compared to 2008

Consumer-to-consumer

operating income decreased 4% during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the decline in
    revenue, incremental costs, including increased technology costs
    and the acquisition of FEXCO, offset somewhat by reduced agent
    commissions, savings realized from the 2008 restructurings and
    better leveraging of our marketing expenses, as described
    earlier. The operating income margin for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was consistent with 2008.

    compared to 2007

Consumer-to-consumer

operating income increased for the year ended December 31,
    2008 compared to 2007, primarily driven by higher revenue and
    related profits from increased transactions internationally and



lower stock-based compensation expenses. Of the
    $22.3 million accelerated stock-based compensation vesting
    charge in 2007 taken in connection with the change in control of
    First Data, that did not recur in 2008, $18.9 million was
    allocated to this segment in 2007. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, the operating income
    increase was partially offset by revenue declines in our United
    States businesses, and higher employee compensation expenses.
    The ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth
    in our international business, which carries lower profit
    margins than in our United States originated business, also
    impacted

consumer-to-consumer

operating income during the year ended December 31, 2008.
    As described earlier in the revenues overview and due to the
    same factors, operating income growth for the

consumer-to-consumer

segment was lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 than that
    experienced in the previous nine months.

Consumer-to-consumer

operating income margin also increased during the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower
    stock-based compensation expense, as described above. This
    increase was partially offset by revenue declines in our United
    States businesses and the shift in our business mix reflecting
    stronger growth in our international business, which carries
    lower profit margins than in our United States originated
    business as noted earlier. However, we have been experiencing a
    convergence between international operating profits margins and
    profit margins of our United States originated businesses.

Revenues

    compared to 2008

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the global
    business payments segment revenue was adversely impacted by the
    weak economic situation in the United States, which resulted in
    a revenue decline in our United States cash and electronic bill
    payments businesses, partially offset by revenue generated from
    our recent acquisition of Custom House, as described below, and
    slight growth in the Pago Fácil business. We believe many
    United States consumers who would use our services are having
    difficulty paying their bills and are unable to obtain credit,
    resulting in our handling fewer bill payments. Due to a
    continued challenging United States economy and competitive
    pressure, we expect to see revenue declines in our United States

consumer-to-business

service offerings in 2010 similar to the declines we experienced
    in 2009. Although the segment’s revenues were primarily
    generated in the United States for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we expect the proportion of
    international revenue, specifically foreign exchange revenue,
    will grow in future periods as a percentage of total revenue due
    to our acquisition of Custom House.



On September 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of
    Canada-based Custom House, a provider of international

business-to-business

payment services. Custom House facilitates cross-border,
    cross-currency payment transactions. The significant majority of
    Custom House’s revenue is from exchanges of currency at the
    spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency payments.
    The credit risk arising from these spot foreign currency
    exchange contracts is largely mitigated, as in the majority of
    cases Custom House requires the receipt of funds from customers
    before releasing the associated cross-currency payment. In
    addition, this business writes foreign currency forward and
    option contracts for their customers to facilitate future
    payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is
    generally nine months or less. The significant majority of
    Custom House’s revenue is generated from transactions
    involving different currencies, in which Custom House generates
    revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by
    Custom House to the customer and the rate at which Custom House
    is able to acquire currency or forward and option contracts.
    This foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the
    customer initiates a transaction with Custom House. The
    acquisition of Custom House contributed $30.8 million to
    total revenue, primarily included in foreign exchange revenue,
    and approximately 200,000 transactions for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to 2008 was driven by our Pago Fácil cash-based
    and United States electronic-based bill payments businesses.
    Both of these businesses carry a lower revenue per transaction
    than our United States cash-based bill payment business. The
    transaction growth was offset by a decline in the United States
    cash-based bill payments business.

    compared to 2007

During the year ended December 31, 2008, overall revenue
    was flat compared to the corresponding period in 2007, as
    revenue growth in the Pago Fácil business was offset by a
    decline in United States cash-based bill payment revenue. The
    global business payments segment, including the United States
    electronic-based bill payments business which experienced flat
    revenues year over year, was adversely impacted in the last half
    of 2008 due to the weakening economy in the United States. Some
    consumers who were likely to use our services were having
    difficulty paying their bills and were unable to obtain credit
    in any form, resulting in us handling fewer bill payments.

Operating
    income

    compared to 2008

For the year ended December 31, 2009, operating income
    decreased compared to the same period in the prior year
    primarily due to operating income declines related to the United
    States-based bill payments business and operating and
    integration costs associated with the acquisition of Custom
    House, offset slightly by the savings generated from the 2008
    restructurings.

The decline in operating income margin in the segment is due to
    the factors described above and continues to be impacted by the
    decline in the United States cash-based bill payments business
    which has a higher operating income margin than our South
    America and electronic businesses.

    compared to 2007

Operating income for the global business payments segment
    decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    2007 primarily due to operating income declines in the United
    States-based bill payments businesses, partially offset by
    growth in Pago Fácil payments. Operating income margins
    also declined as United States electronic-based and Pago
    Fácil payments, which cumulatively represented a higher
    percentage of global business payments revenues in 2008 compared
    to 2007, have lower operating margins than the declining higher
    margin United States cash-based bill payments business.
    Partially offsetting operating income declines for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 was lower
    stock-based compensation expenses as described in the

“consumer-to-consumer”

operating income discussion.

Revenues

    compared to 2008

Revenue remained relatively consistent with prior year and is
    comprised primarily of our money order services business. In the
    fourth quarter, we experienced a decrease in the amount of
    revenue recognized related to our money order services business
    as we no longer receive a fixed return of 5.5% from IPS on the
    outstanding money order balances as described below. However, we
    now derive investment income from actual interest generated on
    our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in
    United States tax exempt state and municipal securities. In 2008
    and 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our
    fixed rate notes to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in
    interest rates. Through a combination of the revenue generated
    from these investment securities and the anticipated interest
    expense savings resulting from these interest rate swaps, we
    estimate that we should be able to retain, a materially
    comparable after-tax rate of return through 2011 as we were
    receiving under the agreement with IPS. However, the results of
    interest expense savings related to the swaps will be reflected
    in interest expense and will not impact operating income.

Effective October 1, 2009, in accordance with the agreement
    signed on July 18, 2008, IPS, a subsidiary of First Data,
    assigned and transferred to us certain operating assets used by
    IPS to issue Western Union branded money orders and
    approximately $860 million of cash sufficient to satisfy
    all outstanding money order liabilities. On the Transition Date,
    we assumed IPS’s role as issuer of the money orders,
    including its obligation to pay outstanding money orders, and
    terminated the existing agreement whereby IPS paid Western Union
    a fixed return of 5.5% on the outstanding money order balances.
    Following the Transition Date, we invested the cash received
    from IPS in high-quality, investment grade securities, primarily
    tax exempt United States state and municipal securities, in
    accordance with applicable regulations, which are the same as
    those currently governing the investment of our United States
    originated money transfer principal.

    compared to 2007

Revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 over
    the same period in 2007 due to revenue growth in our prepaid
    services business generated outside of the United States.

Operating
    income

    compared to 2008

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the decrease in
    operating income was primarily due to increased costs related to
    acquisitions and a decline in our money order services business
    due to the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 as
    described above.

    compared to 2007

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the decrease in
    operating income was driven by operating income declines related
    to our money order services business, costs incurred to develop
    mobile money transfer services and our prepaid business within
    the United States, offset by increased revenue and related
    profits from our prepaid services business outside of the United
    States.



Further financial information relating to each of our
    segments’ external revenue, operating profit measures and
    total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated
    financial statements.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our
    operating activities, driven primarily from net income and
    fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected
    by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding
    borrowings, timing of income tax payments, and collections on
    receivables, among other items. The majority of our interest
    payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results
    in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating
    activities in those quarters, and a corresponding increase to
    the first and third quarters.

Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors,
    some of which are out of our control, including changes in
    economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant
    population, and changes in income tax laws or the status of
    income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax
    matters. In 2010, we are considering making a $250 million
    refundable tax deposit relating to potential United States
    federal tax liabilities arising from our 2003 international
    restructuring. By making the deposit, interest charges related
    to the amount of the deposit will cease. To the extent the
    deposit is not ultimately used to satisfy federal tax
    liabilities, it is refundable with interest.

A significant portion of our cash flows from operating
    activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which
    are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all
    excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use,
    except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions.
    The assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions include
    those located in countries outside of the United States
    containing restrictions from being transferred outside of those
    countries and cash and investment balances that are maintained
    by a regulated subsidiary to secure certain money transfer
    obligations initiated in the United States in accordance with
    applicable state regulations. Significant changes in the
    regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our
    primary source of liquidity.

We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business
    needs, including dividends and share repurchases, through our
    existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows
    through operations. In addition, we have capacity to borrow on
    our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which was
    undrawn at December 31, 2009 and expires in September 2012.

Cash
    and Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $1.7 billion, of which $906 million was held by our
    foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund
    our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash
    balances to fluctuate.

Repatriating foreign funds to the United States would, in many
    cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of
    these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates
    compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the
    United States. We expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund
    our international operations and to acquire businesses
    internationally.

In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain
    other payment services and money orders before we settle the
    payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as
    “settlement assets” on our consolidated balance
    sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn
    income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of
    these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified
    as “cash and cash equivalents” within “settlement
    assets,” to fund settlement obligations.

Investment securities, included in settlement assets, were
    $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2009. Effective
    October 1, 2009, IPS assigned and transferred to us certain
    operating assets used by IPS to issue Western Union branded
    money orders and approximately $860 million of cash
    sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities
    which contributed to the increase in our investment securities
    from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Most
    state regulators in the United States require us to maintain
    specific high-quality, investment grade securities and such
    investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding
    settlement



obligations in accordance with applicable regulations. We do not
    hold investment securities for trading purposes, and all of our
    investment securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at fair value. Under the Payment Services Directive
    (“PSD”) in the European Union, we expect to have a
    similar portfolio of investment securities, which we will manage
    in a similar manner and under similar guidelines as our current
    portfolio.

Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes
    in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit
    risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality
    investments, including diversifying our investment portfolio. As
    of December 31, 2009, the majority of our investment
    securities had credit ratings of “AA-” or better from
    a major credit rating agency. Our investment securities are also
    actively managed with respect to concentration. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were no investments with a single
    issuer or individual securities representing more than 10% of
    our investment securities portfolio.

Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    cash provided by operating activities was $1,218.1 million,
    $1,253.9 million and $1,103.5 million, respectively.
    Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from 2008
    to 2009 due to lower net income, offset by working capital
    fluctuations in 2009 including the settlement accrual and the
    timing of tax payments. Cash flows provided by operating
    activities increased from 2007 to 2008 due to higher net income
    and working capital fluctuations in 2008.

Financing
    Resources

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had the following

Commercial
    Paper

Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured
    commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed
    $1.5 billion outstanding at any time. Our commercial paper
    borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date
    of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market
    rates at the time of issuance. We had no commercial paper
    borrowings at December 31, 2009. Our commercial paper
    borrowings at December 31, 2008 had a weighted-average
    interest rate of approximately 4.1% and a weighted-average
    initial term of 27 days.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

Our revolving credit facility expires in September 2012 and
    includes a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a
    $250.0 million letter of credit

sub-facility

and a $150.0 million swing line

sub-facility

(the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for
    the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms
    of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a
    selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of
    19 basis points. A facility fee of 6 basis points on
    the total facility is payable quarterly regardless of usage. In
    addition, to the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings
    under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related
    aggregate commitments, a utilization fee of 5 basis points
    as of December 31, 2009 based upon such ratings is payable
    to the lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings. The
    interest rate margin, facility fee and utilization fee are all
    based on certain of our credit ratings.

As of December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings
    and had $1.5 billion available to borrow. Our revolving
    credit facility, which is diversified through a group of 15
    participating institutions, is used to provide general liquidity
    for us and to support our commercial paper program, which we
    believe enhances our short term credit rating. The largest
    commitment from any single financial institution within the
    total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately
    20%. The substantial majority of the banks within this group
    were rated at least an “A-” or better as of
    December 31, 2009. If the amount available to borrow under
    the revolving credit facility decreased, or if the revolving
    credit facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of
    borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.

Term
    Loan

On December 5, 2008, we entered into a senior, unsecured,

364-day

term
    loan in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million with
    a syndicate of lenders. The Term Loan was repaid and financed
    with the issuance of the 2014 Notes on February 26, 2009.

Notes

On February 26, 2009, we issued $500 million aggregate
    principal amount of 2014 Notes to repay the balance of the Term
    Loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2009. Interest
    with respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semiannually on
    February 26 and August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum
    interest rate of 6.500%. We may redeem the 2014 Notes at any
    time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on
    the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points.

On November 17, 2006, we issued $2 billion aggregate
    principal amount of our unsecured fixed and floating rate notes,
    comprised of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our
    Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the “Floating Rate
    Notes”), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of
    5.400% Notes due 2011 and $500 million aggregate
    principal amount of 6.200% Notes due 2036 (the “2036
    Notes”). The Floating Rate Notes were paid upon maturity in
    November 2008. Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036
    Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 17 and November
    17 each year. We may redeem the 2011 Notes and



the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of
    par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus
    15 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.

On September 29, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion
    aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on
    October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable
    semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year. We may redeem
    the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of
    par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus
    20 basis points.

Credit
    Ratings and Debt Covenants

The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in
    managing our financing costs and facilitating access to
    additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe
    are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings,
    cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and overall
    business risks.

Our Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest rate margin,
    facility fee and utilization fee, all of which are determined
    based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, we are
    subject to certain provisions in our 2014 Notes and certain of
    our derivative contracts which would require settlement or
    collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined
    with a downgrade below investment grade. We do not have any
    other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that
    are tied to changes in our credit ratings. The table below
    summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2009:

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any
    of our securities. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision
    or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization,
    and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
    rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for
    any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or
    withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment,
    circumstances so warrant. A downgrade or a negative outlook
    provided by the rating agencies could result in the following:

•

Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if
    we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the
    commercial paper market would likely be eliminated;

•

We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future
    financings;

•

Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease;

•

Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements
    on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our
    regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends; and

•

Our agent relationships may be adversely impacted, particularly
    those agents that are financial institutions or post offices.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants which, among
    other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer
    assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another
    company, grant certain types of security interests, incur
    certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary
    dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur
    certain subsidiary level indebtedness. Our notes are subject to
    similar covenants except that only the 2011 Notes, 2016 Notes
    and the 2036 Notes contain a restriction on subsidiary
    indebtedness and none of the notes include a covenant that
    limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary
    dividends. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires
    us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage
    ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted
    EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum of (a) interest
    expense, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation
    expense, (d) amortization expense, (e) any other
    non-cash deductions, losses or changes made in determining net



income for such period and (f) extraordinary losses or
    charges, minus extraordinary gains, in each case determined in
    accordance with United States GAAP for such period, to interest
    expense) for each period comprising the four most recent
    consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage
    ratio was 10:1 for the year ended December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with our
    debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair
    our ability to borrow, and outstanding amounts borrowed could
    become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess
    cash for other purposes.

Cash
    Priorities

Liquidity

Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital
    structure consistent with our current credit ratings. We have
    existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities,
    access to the commercial paper markets and our $1.5 billion
    revolving credit facility available to support the needs of our
    business.

Capital
    Expenditures

The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of
    property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was
    $98.9 million, $153.7 million and $192.1 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Amounts paid for new and
    renewed agent contract costs vary depending on the terms of
    existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed
    contract signings. Other capital expenditures during 2009, 2008
    and 2007 included investments in our information technology,
    purchased and developed software and, in 2008 and 2007, the
    renovation of certain facilities.

Acquisition
    of Businesses

On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada-based Custom
    House, a provider of international

business-to-business

payment services, for cash consideration of $371.0 million
    for 100% of the common shares of this business and acquired cash
    of $2.5 million.

On February 24, 2009, we acquired the money transfer
    business of European-based FEXCO Group Holdings (“FEXCO
    Group”) one of our largest agents providing services in a
    number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom,
    Spain, Sweden and Ireland. We surrendered our 24.65% interest in
    FEXCO Group and paid €123.1 million
    ($157.4 million) as consideration for 100% of the common
    shares of the money transfer business and acquired cash of
    $11.8 million.

In December 2008, we acquired 80% of our existing money transfer
    agent in Peru for a purchase price of $35.0 million. The
    aggregate consideration paid was $29.7 million, net of a
    holdback reserve of $3.0 million and cash acquired of
    $2.3 million.

On August 1, 2008, we acquired the money transfer assets
    from our existing money transfer agent in Panama for a purchase
    price of $18.3 million, which is net of cash acquired. The
    consideration paid was $14.3 million, net of a holdback
    reserve of $4.0 million.

We expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to
    acquire companies, particularly outside of the United States,
    that complement our existing businesses worldwide.

Share
    Repurchases and Dividends

At December 31, 2009, common stock repurchases of up to
    $1.0 billion have been authorized by the Board of Directors
    through December 31, 2012. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 24.8 million,
    58.1 million and 34.7 million shares, respectively,
    have been repurchased for $400.0 million,
    $1,313.9 million and $726.5 million, respectively,
    excluding commissions, at an average cost of $16.10, $22.60 and
    $20.93 per share, respectively.



During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors
    declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share
    representing $41.2 million in total dividends. During the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, our Board of Directors declared
    an annual cash dividend of $0.04 per common share representing
    $28.4 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in
    total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of
    record in December of each respective year.

Equity
    Investments In and Loans to Certain Key Agents

In October 2007, we entered into agreements totaling
    $18.3 million to convert our non-participating interest in
    a joint venture with our Singapore agent, Hersing Corporation
    Ltd., into a fully participating 49% equity interest and
    extended the agent relationship at more favorable commission
    rates to Western Union. As a result, we earn a pro-rata share of
    profits and have enhanced voting rights. We also have the right
    to add additional agent relationships in Singapore under this
    agreement. In October 2007, we completed an agreement to acquire
    a 25% ownership interest in GraceKennedy Money Services
    Caribbean SRL (“GraceKennedy”), an agent in Jamaica
    (which also acts as our agent in several other Caribbean
    countries), and to extend the term of the agent relationship for
    $29.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid resulted in
    $20.2 million of identifiable intangible assets, including
    capitalized contract costs, which are being amortized over seven
    to 10 years.

From time to time, we also make advances and loans to agents.
    Most significantly, in the first quarter 2006, we signed a six
    year agreement with one of our existing agents which included a
    four year loan of $140.0 million to the agent, of which
    $33.1 million, $40.0 million and $30.0 million
    were repaid in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The remaining loan receivable balance
    relating to this agent as of December 31, 2009 was
    $16.9 million and was fully repaid in January 2010.

As opportunities arise, we expect we will continue to
    strategically invest in agents to further strengthen our
    business.

Debt
    Service Requirements

Our 2010 debt service requirements will include interest
    payments on all outstanding indebtedness and may include
    payments on any future borrowings under our commercial paper
    program. We have the ability to use existing financing sources,
    such as our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper
    program, to meet obligations as they arise.

Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions,
    return capital to shareholders, including share repurchases and
    dividends, and service our debt will depend on our ability to
    continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating
    subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those
    operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing
    and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that
    will align with our long-term strategy.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed
    in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, we
    have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
    reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on
    our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
    operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Pension
    Plans

We have two frozen defined benefit pension plans
    (“Plans”) for which we have a recorded unfunded
    pension obligation of $124.2 million as of
    December 31, 2009. Due to the closure of one of our
    facilities in Missouri and a recent agreement with the Pension
    Benefit Guaranty Corporation, we funded $4.1 million into
    one of our subsidiary’s pension plans during 2009. No
    contributions were made to these plans by Western Union during
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Pursuant to
    final guidance issued by the IRS in September 2009, we made
    certain interest rate elections under the Pension Protection Act
    which will require



us to fund approximately $15 million to the plans in 2010,
    which is less than was previously anticipated. In addition, we
    may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately
    $10 million for a total contribution of $25 million to
    the plans in 2010.

Our most recent measurement date for our pension plans was
    December 31, 2009. The calculation of the funded status and
    net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary
    assumptions: 1) expected long-term return on plan assets;
    and 2) discount rate.

Western Union employs a building block approach in determining
    the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets
    are studied and long-term historical relationships between
    equities and fixed income securities are considered consistent
    with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets
    with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long
    run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates
    are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
    determined. Consideration is given to diversification,
    re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities
    held. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for
    reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate
    against a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated
    value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a
    five-year period. Our expected long-term return on plan assets
    was 7.50% for 2009 and 2008. The expected long-term return on
    plan assets is 6.50% for 2010. A 25 basis point change in
    the assumed return for 2010 would impact our annual pension
    expense by approximately $0.8 million.

The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which
    the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount
    rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of
    anticipated payouts under the plans to the rates from an AA spot
    rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying
    maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit
    obligation was 5.30% and 6.26% at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. A 25 basis point change in the discount
    rate would have an impact of less than $0.1 million to our
    annual pension expense.

Contractual
    Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to
    third parties as of December 31, 2009 and the effect such
    obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows
    in future periods (in millions):

(a)

We have estimated our interest payments based on (i) the
    assumption that no commercial paper borrowings will be
    outstanding beyond 2009 and (ii) the assumption that no
    debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of
    our notes.

(b)

The timing of cash payments on unrecognized tax benefits,
    including accrued interest and penalties, is inherently
    uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such
    liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and
    outside our control. In 2010, we are considering making a
    $250 million refundable tax deposit relating to potential
    United States federal tax liabilities arising from our 2003
    international restructuring. By making the deposit, interest
    charges related to the amount of the deposit will cease. To the
    extent the deposit is not ultimately used to satisfy federal tax
    liabilities, it is refundable



Other
    Commercial Commitments

We had $88.0 million in outstanding letters of credit and
    bank guarantees at December 31, 2009, with expiration dates
    through 2015, certain of which contain a one-year renewal
    option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily
    held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent
    agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank
    guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of
    operations and financial condition is based on our financial
    statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. The
    preparation of these financial statements requires that
    management make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and
    other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ
    from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are
    discussed in Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

, of the notes to consolidated financial statements,
    included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data

.

Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below,
    are very important to the portrayal of our financial position
    and our results of operations and applying them requires our
    management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
    We believe that the understanding of these key accounting
    policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight
    into our operating results and financial condition.

Income Taxes

Reinvestment of foreign earnings

Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial
    statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect
    to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our
    operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we
    believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required
    analyses and judgments.

With respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, we
    have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more
    favorable income tax rate than the combined United States
    federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest
    these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely.

At December 31, 2009, no provision had been made for United
    States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of
    approximately $2.0 billion, which are expected to be reinvested
    outside the United States indefinitely.

Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the
    form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to
    United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign
    tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes
    payable to various foreign countries which could result in a
    material impact to our financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows in the period such distribution occurred.
    Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United
    States tax liability is not practicable because of the
    complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Income tax contingencies

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
    when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits
    of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon
    examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated
    financial statements from such a position are measured as the
    largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood
    of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations, which were restructured in 2003. Our tax reserves reflect management’s judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed audits of t
he United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for the years 2002 through 2004, which include our taxable results for those years. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these audits.

Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement signed in connection with the Spin-off from First Data, we believe we have appropriately apportioned the taxes between First Data and us.

Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2009 were $522.7 million, including interest and penalties. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates, particularly with respect to our 2003 restructuring of our international operations, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize derivatives to (a) minimize our exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency

business-to-business

payments by writing derivatives to customers and entering into offsetting derivatives with established financial institution counterparties, or by holding sufficient foreign currency cash balances to cover those transactions. We recognize all derivatives in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.

Cash Flow hedges—Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted money transfer revenues and hedges of anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss ar
e reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item. The portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in “Derivative (losses)/gains, net.”

Fair Value hedges—Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense.

The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements.

The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis.

If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively.

While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported results.

As of December 31, 2009, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss from such cash flow hedges that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $24.6 million.

As of December 31, 2009, the cumulative debt adjustments from our fair value hedges that would be reflected in earnings if such hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was a $47.1 million gain.

Other Intangible Assets

We capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as well as acquired intangible assets and software.

We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounted cash flows) is required.

The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract.

The estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions including among other things revenue growth rates, and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans.

Disruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset.

If an event described above occurs and causes us to determine that an asset has been impaired, that could result in an impairment charge. We did not record any impairment charges related to other intangible assets during the three year period ended December 31, 2009.

The net carrying value of our other intangible assets at December 31, 2009 was $489.2 million.

Goodwill Impairment Testing

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill, by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds i
ts implied fair value, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.

We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected regulatory, marketplace and other economic factors.

The determination of the reporting units also requires judgment.

We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change.

If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it could impact our reported earnings in the periods such charge occurs.

The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2009 was $2,143.4 million which represented approximately 29% of our consolidated assets.

We have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2009.

The fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts for the three years ended December 31, 2009.

Description

Judgments and Uncertainties

Assumptions

Acquisitions—Purchase Price Allocation

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

For most acquisitions, we engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as agent networks, customer relationships, tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period of one year or less as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Purchase price allocation methodology requires management to
    make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value
    of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the
    fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted
    cash flows and replacement cost analysis.

During the last three years, we completed the following
    significant acquisitions:

•   In September 2009, we acquired Custom
    House for $371.0 million.

•   In February 2009, we acquired the money
    transfer business of FEXCO for $243.6 million.

•   In 2008, we acquired an 80% interest in
    our existing money transfer agent in Peru and the money transfer
    assets of an agent in Panama for a total of $53.3 million.

See Note 3,

Acquisitions

, to the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, of this
    Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information related to the
    purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed during the
    last three years.

If estimates or assumptions used to complete the purchase price
    allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and
    liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made, the
    allocation of purchase price between goodwill and intangibles
    could significantly differ.  Such a difference would impact
    future earnings through amortization expense of these
    intangibles. In addition, if forecasts supporting the valuation
    of the intangibles or goodwill are not achieved, impairments
    could arise, as discussed further in “Goodwill Impairment
    Testing” and “Other Intangible Assets” above.
    For the acquisitions discussed above, goodwill of $504.1 million
    and intangibles of $208.7 million were recognized.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting requirements
    for the consolidation of variable interest entities. Variable
    interest entities are those entities that require additional
    financial support beyond that provided by traditional equity
    holders. The new consolidation guidance will require
    consideration of whether we have the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact each entities’
    economic performance. We have not yet completed our assessment
    of this guidance; however, the impact of adopting these new
    requirements is not expected to have a significant impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market
    rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents
    and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage
    these risks.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates

We provide

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer services in more than 200 countries and
    territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the
    structure of the business and an active risk management process.
    We settle with the vast majority of our agents in United States
    dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle
    in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain
    local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not
    reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay
    illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does
    exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions
    are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated. To
    mitigate this risk further, we enter into short-term foreign
    currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few
    days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We
    also utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with
    terms of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated cash positions and intercompany loans. In certain
    consumer money transfer and global business payments
    transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we
    generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange
    rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our
    agents are able to acquire currency, helping to provide
    protection against currency fluctuations. We promptly buy and
    sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables
    and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies.

We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to
    mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates on

consumer-to-consumer

revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and to a lesser
    degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies.
    We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at
    inception to mitigate some of the risk that changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with
    a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year.
    We believe the use of longer-term foreign currency forward
    contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our
    international

consumer-to-consumer

operations.

With the acquisition of Custom House in the third quarter of
    2009, our foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange
    risk management has increased due to the nature of this
    business. The significant majority of Custom House’s
    revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling
    customers to make cross-currency payments. This business also
    writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our
    customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these
    derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. Custom
    House aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from
    customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described
    above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering
    into offsetting contracts with established financial institution
    counterparties. The foreign exchange risk is actively managed.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, a hypothetical uniform 10%
    strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States
    dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are
    generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre-tax
    annual income of approximately $27 million and
    $24 million, respectively, based on our forecast of

consumer-to-consumer

unhedged 2010 exposure to foreign currency. There are inherent
    limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the
    assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and
    instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static, and that we
    would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the
    analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more
    complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or
    negatively affect income.

Interest
    Rates

We invest in several types of interest bearing assets, with a
    total value at December 31, 2009 of $2.7 billion.
    Approximately $2.0 billion of these assets bear interest at
    floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in
    interest rates. These assets primarily include money market
    funds and state and



municipal variable rate securities and are included in our
    consolidated balance sheets within “cash and cash
    equivalents” and “settlement assets.” To the
    extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers
    and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are
    classified as “settlement assets.” Earnings on these
    investments will increase and decrease with changes in the
    underlying short-term interest rates.

Substantially all of the remainder of our interest bearing
    assets consist of highly rated state and municipal obligations,
    the majority of which are fixed rate instruments. These
    investments may include investments made from cash received from
    our money transfer business and other related payment services
    awaiting redemption classified within “settlement
    assets” in the consolidated balance sheets. As interest
    rates rise, the fair value of these fixed rate interest-bearing
    securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest
    rates would result in an increase to the fair values of the
    securities. We have classified these investments as

available-for-sale

within “settlement assets” in the consolidated balance
    sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their
    fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the
    applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or
    deducted from our “total stockholders’
    equity/(deficiency)” on our consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2009, $750 million of our total
    $3,048.5 million in borrowings was effectively floating
    rate debt through interest rate swap agreements, changing our
    fixed-rate debt to LIBOR-based floating rate debt, with average
    spreads of approximately 200 basis points above LIBOR.
    Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a
    short period that the financing is effectively floating rate. No
    commercial paper borrowings were outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009.

We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by
    evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also
    considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage
    this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to
    minimize risk, reduce costs, and optimize returns. Our exposure
    to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our
    interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of fixed
    versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily
    through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision
    regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus
    floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to
    increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market
    conditions. At December 31, 2009, our weighted-average
    interest rate on our borrowings outstanding, including our
    hedges, was approximately 5.1%.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in
    interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre-tax
    income of approximately $8 million and $12 million
    annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
    The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest
    rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 that are sensitive to interest
    rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting
    benefit/reduction to pre-tax income of approximately
    $20 million and $13 million annually, respectively.
    There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis
    presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate
    changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is
    unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market
    changes that could arise, including changes in credit risk
    regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively
    affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus
    floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and
    liabilities will change over time.

Credit
    Risk

Our interest earning assets include investment securities,
    substantially all of which are state and municipal debt
    obligations, which are classified in “settlement
    assets” and accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities, and money market fund investments, which are
    classified in “cash and cash equivalents.” The
    majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of
    “AA-” or better from a major credit rating agency.

On September 15, 2008, we requested redemption of our
    shares in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. (the
    “Fund”), a money market fund, totaling
    $298.1 million. In 2009, we received partial distributions
    totaling $255.5 million from the Fund. We continue to
    vigorously pursue collection of the remaining balance and
    believe we have a right to full payment of the remaining amount
    based on the written and verbal representations from the Manager
    and our legal position. However, given the increased uncertainty
    surrounding the numerous third-party legal claims associated
    with the Fund, we reserved $12 million



representing the estimated impact of a pro-rata distribution of
    the Fund during 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had a
    remaining receivable balance of $30.6 million, net of the
    related reserve, which is included in “other assets”
    in the consolidated balance sheet. If further deterioration
    occurs in the underlying assets in the Fund, or if the Fund
    incurs significant legal

and/or

administrative costs during the distribution process, we may
    record additional reserves related to the remaining receivable
    balance, which could negatively affect our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to
    investment securities, money market investments and other credit
    risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and
    financial institutions, we regularly review investment
    concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit
    ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among
    global financial institutions. Since January 1, 2009, we
    also limit our investment level to no more than
    $100 million with respect to individual funds.

We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable
    balances from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment
    and money order settlement process. In addition, we are exposed
    to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly
    through our internet services and electronic channels, where
    transactions are originated through means other than cash, and
    therefore are subject to “chargebacks,” insufficient
    funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud. We perform
    a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic
    analyses. Our losses associated with agent and consumer bad
    debts have been less than 1% of our revenues in all periods
    presented. We continue to monitor the credit worthiness of our
    agents, and due to the challenging economy, we have closed
    agents at higher rates than in prior years, primarily small
    retailers in the United States. Closing agents may impact
    transactions and revenues.

As a result of our acquisition of Custom House, we are now
    exposed to credit risk relating to derivative financial
    instruments written by us to our customers. The duration of
    these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. To
    mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an
    ongoing basis. In addition, we may require certain customers to
    post collateral based on the fair value of the customer’s
    contract and their risk profile. The credit risk arising from
    our spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely
    mitigated, as in most cases we require the receipt of funds from
    our customers before releasing the associated cross-currency
    payment.

Management’s
    Report on the Financial Statements

Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
    objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements and the related financial information. The financial
    statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on
    estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared
    the related financial information included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the
    financial statements.

As stated in their report included elsewhere in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

the consolidated financial statements have been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm who conducted their audits in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2009. The independent registered public accounting firm’s
    responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness, in
    all material respects, with which such financial statements
    present our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Western Union
    Company’s (“Western Union” or the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Western Union’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are
    being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and Board of Directors; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Western Union’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, utilizing the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company
    completed its acquisition of Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom
    House”) effective September 1, 2009. As permitted by
    the Securities and Exchange Commission, management’s
    assessment did not include the internal control of the acquired
    operations of Custom House, which are included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements as of
    December 31, 2009 and for the period from September 1,
    2009 through December 31, 2009. The assets of Custom House,
    excluding goodwill, constituted approximately 5% of the
    Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2009, and
    Custom House revenues constituted approximately 0.6% of our
    total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Based
    on the results of its evaluation, which excluded an assessment
    of the internal control of the acquired operations of Custom
    House, the Company’s management concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is effective. Western Union’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009
    has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Western
    Union’s independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their attestation report included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union
    Company

We have audited The Western Union Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
    based on criteria established in Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
    criteria). The Western Union Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s
    assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting did not include the internal
    controls of Custom House, Ltd., which was acquired
    September 1, 2009 and is included in the consolidated
    financial statements of The Western Union Company as of
    December 31, 2009 and for the period from September 1,
    2009 through December 31, 2009. The assets of Custom House,
    Ltd., excluding goodwill, constituted approximately 5% of The
    Western Union Company’s total assets as of
    December 31, 2009, and Custom House, Ltd. revenues
    constituted approximately 0.6% of The Western Union
    Company’s total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting of The Western
    Union Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal
    control over financial reporting of Custom House, Ltd.

In our opinion, The Western Union Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of The Western Union Company as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’
    equity/(deficiency) for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2009 and our report dated
    February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union
    Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    The Western Union Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows,
    and stockholders’ equity/(deficiency) for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Western Union Company at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” (codified in FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification Topic 740, “Income Taxes”).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The
    Western Union Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion thereon.

THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Formation
    of the Entity and Basis of Presentation

The Western Union Company (“Western Union” or the
    “Company”) is a leader in global money transfer and
    payment services, providing people and businesses with fast,
    reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments
    around the world. The Western
    Union

®

brand is globally recognized. The Company’s services are
    available through a network of agent locations in more than 200
    countries and territories. Each location in the Company’s
    agent network is capable of providing one or more of the
    Company’s services.

The Western Union business consists of the following segments:

•

Consumer-to-consumer—money

transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global
    network of third-party agents using the Company’s
    multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems.
    This service is available for international cross-border
    transfers—that is, the transfer of funds from one country
    to another—and, in certain countries, intra-country
    transfers—that is, money transfers from one location to
    another in the same country.

•

Global business payments (formerly

consumer-to-business)— the

processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other
    businesses. The Company’s business payments services allow
    consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations
    including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers,
    financial service providers, government agencies and other
    businesses. As described further in Note 3,
    “Acquisitions,” the Company acquired Canada-based
    Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom House”), a provider of
    international

business-to-business

payment services, which is included in this segment. Custom
    House facilitates cross-border, cross-currency payment
    transactions. While the Company continues to pursue further
    international expansion of its offerings in this segment, the
    segment’s revenue was primarily generated in the United
    States during all periods presented.

All businesses that have not been classified into the

consumer-to-consumer

or global business payments segments are reported as
    “Other” and primarily include the Company’s money
    order services business. Prior to October 1, 2009, the
    Company’s money orders were issued by Integrated Payment
    Systems Inc. (“IPS”), a subsidiary of First Data
    Corporation (“First Data”), to consumers at retail
    locations primarily in the United States and Canada. Effective
    October 1, 2009, the Company assumed the responsibility for
    issuing money orders.

There are legal or regulatory limitations on transferring
    certain assets of the Company outside of the countries where
    these assets are located, or which constitute undistributed
    earnings of affiliates of the Company accounted for under the
    equity method of accounting. However, there are generally no
    limitations on the use of these assets within those countries.
    As of December 31, 2009, the amount of net assets subject
    to these limitations totaled approximately $190 million.

Various aspects of the Company’s services and businesses
    are subject to United States federal, state and local
    regulation, as well as regulation by foreign jurisdictions,
    including certain banking and other financial services
    regulations.

Spin-off
    from First Data

On January 26, 2006, the First Data Board of Directors
    announced its intention to pursue the distribution of 100% of
    its money transfer and consumer payments business and its
    interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its
    related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free
    distribution to First Data shareholders (the
    “Separation” or “Spin-off”). Effective on
    September 29, 2006, First Data completed the separation and
    the distribution of these businesses by distributing The Western
    Union Company common stock to First Data shareholders (the
    “Distribution”). Prior to the Distribution, the
    Company had been a segment of First Data.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Basis
    of Presentation

The financial statements in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts
    of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
    eliminated.

Consistent with industry practice, the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets are unclassified due to the short-term nature of
    Western Union’s settlement obligations contrasted with the
    Company’s ability to invest cash awaiting settlement in
    long-term investment securities.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ from these estimates.

Principles
    of Consolidation

Western Union consolidates financial results when it will absorb
    a majority of an entity’s expected losses or residual
    returns or when it has the ability to exert control over the
    entity. Control is normally established when ownership interests
    exceed 50% in an entity. Western Union utilizes the equity
    method of accounting when it is able to exercise significant
    influence over the entity’s operations, which generally
    occurs when Western Union has an ownership interest of between
    20% and 50% in an entity.

Earnings
    Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is computed by
    dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
    weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
    for the period. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded
    from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share
    reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding
    stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of
    restricted stock have vested, using the treasury stock method.
    The treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise
    price of stock options, the unamortized compensation expense and
    assumed tax benefits of options and restricted stock are
    available to acquire shares at an average market price
    throughout the year, and therefore, reduce the dilutive effect.

As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were
    37.5 million, 8.0 million and 10.4 million,
    respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of
    Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share
    calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive. During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, the average market price of the
    Company’s common stock was lower than the exercise price
    for most of its outstanding options, resulting in higher
    anti-dilutive shares than in the comparable prior periods.

The following table provides the calculation of diluted
    weighted-average shares outstanding (in millions):

For the Year Ended December 31,

THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair values of its assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    accordance with the hierarchy described below. The fair values
    of the assets and liabilities held in the Company’s defined
    benefit plan trust (“Trust”) are recognized or
    disclosed utilizing the same hierarchy. The following three
    levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

•

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1
    prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
    quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs
    that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities. Western Union utilizes pricing services to value
    its Level 2 financial instruments. For most of these
    assets, the Company utilizes pricing services that use multiple
    prices as inputs to determine daily market values. In addition,
    the Trust has other investments that fall within Level 2
    that are valued at net asset value which is not quoted on an
    active market, however, the unit price is based on underlying
    investments which are traded on an active market.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and
    liabilities include items where the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation. The
    Company has Level 3 assets that are recognized and
    disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis related to the
    Company’s business combinations, where the values of the
    intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a purchase are
    derived utilizing one of the three recognized approaches: the
    market approach, the income approach or the cost approach.

Except as it pertains to an investment redemption discussed in
    Note 9, carrying amounts for many Western Union financial
    instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, settlement
    cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivables, settlement
    obligations, borrowings under the commercial paper program and
    other short-term notes payable, approximate fair value due to
    their short maturities. Investment securities, included in
    settlement assets, and derivative financial instruments are
    carried at fair value and included in Note 8, “Fair
    Value Measurements.” Fixed rate notes are carried at their
    original issuance values as adjusted over time to accrete that
    value to par, except for portions of notes hedged by interest
    rate swap agreements as disclosed in Note 14. The fair
    values of fixed rate notes are also disclosed in Note 15
    and are based on market quotations. For more information on the
    fair value of financial instruments see Note 8, “Fair
    Value Measurements.”

The fair values of non-financial assets and liabilities related
    to the Company’s business combinations are disclosed in
    Note 3. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities
    related to the Trust are disclosed in Note 11.

Business
    Combinations

The Company accounts for all business combinations where control
    over another entity is obtained using the acquisition method of
    accounting, which requires that most assets (both tangible and
    intangible), liabilities (including contingent consideration),
    and remaining noncontrolling interests be recognized at fair
    value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase
    price over the fair value of assets less liabilities and
    noncontrolling interests is recognized as goodwill. Certain
    adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets,
    liabilities, or noncontrolling interests made subsequent to the
    acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is
    one year or less, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any
    adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in
    income. Any cost or equity method interest that the Company
    holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is
    remeasured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or
    loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value
    and existing book value. Results of operations



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

of the acquired company are included in the Company’s
    results from the date of the acquisition forward and includes
    amortization expense arising from acquired intangible assets.
    Effective January 1, 2009, the Company expenses all costs
    as incurred related to or involved with an acquisition in
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses.
    Previously, such amounts were capitalized as part of the
    acquisition.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments (other than those included in
    settlement assets) with maturities of three months or less at
    the date of purchase (that are readily convertible to cash), are
    considered to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which
    approximates market value.

Western Union maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with
    various financial institutions, including a substantial portion
    in money market funds. Western Union limits the concentration of
    its cash and cash equivalents with any one institution; however,
    such balances often exceed United States federal deposit
    insurance limits. Western Union regularly reviews investment
    concentrations and credit worthiness of these institutions, and
    has relationships with a globally diversified list of banks and
    financial institutions.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Western Union records an allowance for doubtful accounts when it
    is probable that the related receivable balance will not be
    collected based on its history of collection experience, known
    collection issues, such as agent suspensions and bankruptcies,
    and other matters the Company identifies in its routine
    collection monitoring. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $33.7 million and $21.6 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, and is recorded in the same
    Consolidated Balance Sheet caption as the related receivable.
    During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    the provision for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) reflected
    in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $36.2 million,
    $26.6 million and $23.5 million, respectively.

Settlement
    Assets and Obligations

Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received
    from agents for unsettled money transfers, money orders and
    consumer payments. Western Union records corresponding
    settlement obligations relating to amounts payable under money
    transfers, money orders and consumer payment service
    arrangements. Settlement assets and obligations also include
    amounts receivable from and payable to businesses for the value
    of customer cross-currency payment transactions related to the
    global business payments segment.

Settlement assets consist of cash and cash equivalents,
    receivables from selling agents and

business-to-business

customers and investment securities. Cash received by Western
    Union agents generally becomes available to Western Union within
    one week after initial receipt by the agent. Cash equivalents
    consist of short-term time deposits, commercial paper and other
    highly liquid investments. Receivables from selling agents
    represent funds collected by such agents, but in transit to
    Western Union. Western Union has a large and diverse agent base,
    thereby reducing the credit risk of the Company from any one
    agent. In addition, Western Union performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its agents’ financial condition and credit
    worthiness.

Receivables from

business-to-business

customers arise from cross-currency payment transactions in the
    global business payments segment. Receivables (for currency to
    be received) and payables (for the cross-currency payments to be
    made) are recognized at trade date for these transactions. The
    credit risk arising from these spot foreign currency exchange
    contracts is largely mitigated, as in most cases Custom House
    requires the receipt of funds from customers before releasing
    the associated cross-currency payment.

Settlement obligations consist of money transfer, money order
    and payment service payables and payables to agents. Money
    transfer payables represent amounts to be paid to transferees
    when they request their funds. Money order payables represent
    amounts not yet presented for payment. Most agents typically
    settle with



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

transferees first and then obtain reimbursement from Western
    Union. Payment service payables represent amounts to be paid to
    utility companies, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers,
    financial service providers, government agencies and others. Due
    to the agent funding and settlement process, payables to agents
    represent amounts due to agents for money transfers that have
    been settled with transferees.

In 2009, the Company’s settlement assets and obligations
    include assets and obligations transferred as a result of the
    Company assuming the money order assets and obligations
    previously held by IPS. See Note 7 for information
    concerning the Company’s investment securities.

    10 years for equipment, furniture and fixtures, and
    30 years for buildings) or the lease term. Maintenance and
    repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective
    assets, are charged to expense as incurred.

Deferred
    Customer Set Up Costs

The Company capitalizes direct incremental costs not to exceed
    related deferred revenues associated with the enrollment of
    customers in the Equity Accelerator program, a service that
    allows consumers to make mortgage payments based on a customized
    payment program. Deferred customer set up costs, included in
    “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
    amortized to “Cost of services” in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income over the length of the customer’s
    expected participation in the program, generally five to seven
    years. Actual customer attrition data is assessed at least
    annually and the amortization period is adjusted prospectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
    value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired, less
    liabilities assumed arising from business combinations. The
    Company’s annual goodwill impairment test did not identify
    any goodwill impairment during the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007.

Other
    Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets primarily consist of contract costs
    (primarily amounts paid to agents in connection with
    establishing and renewing long-term contracts), acquired
    contracts and software. Other intangible assets are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the length of the contract or benefit
    periods. Included in “Cost of services” in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income is amortization expense of
    approximately $98.3 million, $82.3 million and
    $74.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company capitalizes initial payments for new and renewed
    agent contracts to the extent recoverable through future
    operations or penalties in the case of early termination. The
    Company’s accounting policy is to limit the amount of
    capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the
    estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination
    fees the Company would receive in the event of early termination
    of the contract.

Acquired contracts include customer and contractual
    relationships and networks of subagents that are recognized in
    connection with our acquisitions.

The Company develops software that is used in providing
    services. Software development costs are capitalized once
    technological feasibility of the software has been established.
    Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility
    are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is
    established when the Company has completed all planning and
    designing activities that are necessary to determine that a
    product can be produced to meet its design specifications,
    including functions, features and technical performance
    requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is
    available for general use. Software development costs and
    purchased software are generally amortized over a term of three
    to five years.

The estimated future aggregate amortization expense for existing
    other intangible assets as of December 31, 2009 is expected
    to be $107.6 million in 2010, $89.1 million in 2011,
    $61.6 million in 2012, $44.7 million in 2013,
    $38.1 million in 2014 and $148.1 million thereafter.

Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual
    basis and whenever events indicate that their carrying amount
    may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted
    cash flows associated with these assets or operations are
    compared with their carrying values to determine if a write-down
    to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique)
    is required. Western Union did not record any impairment related
    to other intangible assets during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from consumer
    money transfer transaction fees that are based on the principal
    amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which
    funds are transferred. The Company also offers several global
    business payments services, including payments from consumers or
    businesses to other businesses. Transaction fees are set by the
    Company and recorded as revenue at the time of sale.

In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments
    transactions involving different currencies, the Company
    generates revenue based on the difference between the exchange
    rate set by the Company to the customer and the rate at which
    the Company or its agents are able to acquire currency. This
    foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the related
    consumer money transfer transaction fee revenue is recognized or
    at the time a customer initiates a transaction through the
    Company’s cross-border, cross-currency international

business-to-business

payment service operations.

The Company’s Equity Accelerator service generally requires
    a consumer to pay an upfront enrollment fee to participate in
    this mortgage payment service. These enrollment fees are
    deferred and recognized into income over the length of the
    customer’s expected participation in the program, generally
    five to seven years. Actual customer attrition data is assessed
    at least annually and the period over which revenue is
    recognized is adjusted prospectively. Many factors impact the
    duration of the expected customer relationship, including
    interest rates, refinance activity and trends in consumer
    behavior.

Cost
    of Services

Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions and
    expenses for call centers, settlement operations, and related
    information technology costs. Expenses within these functions
    include personnel,



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation
    and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with
    providing money transfer and other payment services.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred
    or at the time the advertising first takes place. Advertising
    costs for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
    were $201.4 million, $247.1 million and
    $264.2 million, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

Western Union accounts for income taxes under the liability
    method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be determined based on the expected future income tax
    consequences of events that have been recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences
    between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases
    of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in
    the years in which the temporary differences are expected to
    reverse.

The Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax
    positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the
    technical merits of the position, the tax position will be
    sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any
    related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in
    the consolidated financial statements from such a position are
    measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
    percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The United States dollar is the functional currency for all of
    Western Union’s businesses except global business payments
    subsidiaries located primarily in Canada and South America.
    Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
    prevailing during the period. Foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities for those entities for which the local
    currency is the functional currency are translated into United
    States dollars based on exchange rates at the end of the period.
    The effects of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from
    the translation of assets and liabilities of these entities are
    included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive
    loss.” Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
    liabilities of operations in which the United States dollar is
    the functional currency are remeasured based on exchange rates
    at the end of the period and are recognized in operations.
    Non-monetary assets and liabilities of these operations are
    remeasured at historical rates in effect when the asset was
    recognized or the liability was incurred.

Derivatives

Western Union utilizes derivatives to (a) minimize its
    exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency

business-to-business

payments by writing derivatives to customers and entering into
    offsetting derivatives with established financial institution
    counterparties, or by holding sufficient foreign currency cash
    balances to cover those transactions. The Company recognizes all
    derivatives in the “Other assets” and “Other
    liabilities” captions in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at their fair value. All cash flows associated
    with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating
    activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

•

Cash Flow hedges—Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded
    in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” Cash flow
    hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted
    revenues, as well as, from time to time, hedges of anticipated
    fixed rate debt issuances. Derivative fair value changes that
    are captured in “Accumulated other



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

comprehensive loss” are reclassified to earnings in the
    same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings. The
    portion of the change in fair value that is excluded from the
    measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in
    “Derivative (losses)/gains, net.”

•

Fair Value hedges—Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    that are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt are
    recorded in interest expense. The offsetting change in value of
    the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the
    benchmark interest rate is also recorded in interest expense.

•

Undesignated—Derivative contracts entered into to reduce
    the variability related to (a) money transfer settlement
    assets and obligations, generally with maturities of a few days
    up to one month, and (b) certain money transfer related
    foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany
    loans, generally with maturities of less than one year, are not
    designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in
    their fair value are included in “Selling, general and
    administrative.” Subsequent to the acquisition of Custom
    House, the Company is also exposed to risk from derivative
    contracts written to its customers arising from its
    cross-currency

business-to-business

payments operations. These contracts have durations generally of
    nine months or less. The Company aggregates its foreign exchange
    exposures in its Custom House business, including the exposure
    generated by the derivative contracts it writes to its customers
    as part of its cross-currency payments business, and typically
    hedges the net exposure through offsetting contracts with
    established financial institution counterparties. To mitigate
    credit risk, the Company performs credit reviews of the customer
    on an ongoing basis. The changes in fair value related to these
    contracts are recorded in “Foreign exchange revenue.”

The fair value of the Company’s derivatives is derived from
    standardized models that use market based inputs (e.g., forward
    prices for foreign currency).

The details of each designated hedging relationship are formally
    documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the
    risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item,
    specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how
    effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any,
    will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in
    offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged
    item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a
    retrospective and prospective basis.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company currently has a stock-based compensation plan that
    provides for the granting of Western Union stock options,
    restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees
    who perform services for the Company. In addition, the Company
    has a stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of
    Western Union stock options and stock unit awards to
    non-employee directors of the Company. Prior to the Spin-off,
    employees of Western Union participated in First Data’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

All stock-based compensation to employees is required to be
    measured at fair value and expensed over the requisite service
    period and also requires an estimate of forfeitures when
    calculating compensation expense. The Company recognizes
    compensation expense on awards on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period for the entire award. Refer to
    Note 16 for additional discussion regarding details of the
    Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Restructuring
    and Related Expenses

The Company records severance-related expenses once they are
    both probable and estimable related to severance provided under
    an ongoing benefit arrangement. One-time, involuntary benefit
    arrangements and other exit costs are generally recognized when
    the liability is incurred. Costs arising under the
    Company’s defined benefit pension plans from curtailing
    future service of employees participating in the plans and
    providing enhanced benefits are recognized in earnings when it
    is probable and reasonably estimable. The



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company also evaluates impairment issues associated with
    restructuring activities when the carrying amount of the assets
    may not be fully recoverable. Restructuring and related expenses
    consist of direct and incremental costs associated with
    restructuring and related activities, including severance,
    outplacement and other employee related benefits; facility
    closure and migration of the Company’s IT infrastructure;
    other expenses related to relocation of various operations to
    existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including
    hiring, training, relocation, travel and professional fees. Also
    included in facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses
    related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and
    acceleration of depreciation and amortization. For more
    information on the Company’s restructuring and related
    expenses see Note 4, “Restructuring and Related
    Expenses.”

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new accounting
    requirements for the consolidation of variable interest
    entities. Variable interest entities are those entities that
    require additional financial support beyond that provided by
    traditional equity holders. The new consolidation guidance will
    require consideration of whether the Company has the power to
    direct the activities that most significantly impact each
    entities’ economic performance. The Company has not yet
    completed its assessment of this guidance; however, the impact
    of adopting these new requirements is not expected to have a
    significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Acquisitions

Custom
    House, Ltd.

On September 1, 2009, the Company acquired Canada-based
    Custom House, a provider of international

business-to-business

payment services, for $371.0 million. The acquisition of
    Custom House has allowed the Company to enter the international

business-to-business

payments market. Custom House facilitates cross-border,
    cross-currency payment transactions. These payment transactions
    are conducted through various channels including the telephone
    and internet. The significant majority of Custom House’s
    revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling
    customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, this
    business writes foreign currency forward and option contracts
    for their customers to facilitate future payments. The duration
    of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less.
    The results of operations for Custom House have been included in
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the
    date of acquisition, September 1, 2009.

The valuation of assets acquired resulted in $118.1 million
    of identifiable intangible assets, $99.8 million of which
    were attributable to customer and other contractual
    relationships and were valued using an income approach and
    $18.3 million of other intangibles, which were valued using
    both income and cost approaches. These fair values were derived
    using primarily unobservable Level 3 inputs which require
    significant management judgment and estimation. For the
    remaining assets and liabilities, fair value approximated
    carrying value. The intangible assets related to customer and
    other contractual relationships are being amortized over 10 to
    12 years. The remaining intangibles are being amortized
    over three to five years. The goodwill recognized of
    $272.2 million is attributable to the projected long-term
    business growth in current and new markets and an assembled
    workforce. All goodwill relates entirely to the global business
    payments segment. The preliminary assessment of goodwill
    expected to be deductible for United States income tax purposes
    is approximately $225.1 million. The net deferred tax
    liability of $31.9 million and the resulting impacts on
    goodwill are preliminary and will be completed once the Company
    finalizes its tax review for this acquisition. In addition, the
    Company is finalizing its analysis of the accounts associated
    with working capital and settlement, which may also result in an
    adjustment to goodwill.

FEXCO

On February 24, 2009, the Company acquired the money
    transfer business of European-based FEXCO, one of the
    Company’s largest agents providing services in a number of
    European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden
    and Ireland. The acquisition of FEXCO’s money transfer
    business has assisted the Company in the implementation of the
    Payment Services Directive (“PSD”) in the European
    Union by providing an initial operating infrastructure. The PSD
    has allowed the Company to operate under a single license in the
    27 European Union countries and, in those European Union
    countries where the Company has been limited to working with
    banks, post-banks and foreign exchange houses, to expand its
    network to additional types of businesses. The acquisition does
    not impact the Company’s revenue, because the Company was
    already recording 100% of the revenue arising from money
    transfers originating at FEXCO’s locations. As of the
    acquisition date, the Company no longer incurs commission costs
    for transactions related to FEXCO; rather, the Company now pays
    commissions directly to former FEXCO subagents, resulting in
    lower overall



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

commission expense. The Company’s operating expenses
    include costs attributable to FEXCO’s operations subsequent
    to the acquisition date.

Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 24.65% interest in
    FEXCO Group Holdings (“FEXCO Group”), which was a
    holding company for both the money transfer business as well as
    various unrelated businesses. The Company surrendered its 24.65%
    interest in FEXCO Group as non-cash consideration, which had an
    estimated fair value of $86.2 million on the acquisition
    date, and paid €123.1 million ($157.4 million) as
    additional consideration for 100% of the common shares of the
    money transfer business, resulting in a total purchase price of
    $243.6 million. The Company recognized no gain or loss in
    connection with the disposition of its equity interest in the
    FEXCO Group, because its estimated fair value approximated its
    carrying value. The Company recorded the assets and liabilities
    of FEXCO at fair value, excluding the deferred tax liability.

The valuation of assets acquired resulted in $74.9 million
    of identifiable intangible assets, $64.8 million of which
    were attributable to the network of subagents, which were valued
    using an income approach, and $10.1 million relating to
    other intangibles, which were valued using both income and cost
    approaches. These fair values, along with the fair value of the
    Company’s 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group, were derived
    using primarily unobservable Level 3 inputs which require
    significant management judgment and estimation. For the
    remaining assets and liabilities, fair value approximated
    carrying value. The subagent network intangible assets are being
    amortized over 10 to 15 years. The remaining intangibles
    are being amortized over two to three years. The goodwill
    recognized of $190.6 million is attributable to growth
    opportunities that will arise from the Company directly managing
    its agent relationships through a dedicated sales force,
    expected synergies, projected long-term business growth and an
    assembled workforce. All goodwill relates entirely to the

consumer-to-consumer

segment and $91.1 million is expected to be deductible for
    income tax purposes.

Other
    acquisitions

In December 2008, the Company acquired 80% of its existing money
    transfer agent in Peru for a purchase price of
    $35.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid was
    $29.7 million, net of a holdback reserve of
    $3.0 million. The Company acquired cash of
    $2.3 million as part of the acquisition. In 2009,
    $1.0 million of the holdback reserve was paid and the
    remainder is scheduled to be paid in annual $1.0 million
    increments

in December 2010 and 2011, subject to the terms of the
    agreement. The results of operations of the acquiree have been
    included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    since the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation
    resulted in $10.1 million of identifiable intangible
    assets, a significant portion of which were attributable to the
    network of subagents acquired by the Company. The identifiable
    intangible assets are being amortized over three to
    10 years and goodwill of $27.1 million was recorded,
    most of which is expected to be deductible for income tax
    purposes. In addition, the Company has the option to acquire the
    remaining 20% of the money transfer agent and the money transfer
    agent has the option to sell the remaining 20% to the Company
    within 12 months after December 2013 at fair value.

In August 2008, the Company acquired the money transfer assets
    from its then-existing money transfer agent in Panama for a
    purchase price of $18.3 million. The consideration paid was
    $14.3 million, net of a holdback reserve of
    $4.0 million. In 2009, $1.7 million of the holdback
    reserve was paid and the remainder is scheduled to be paid in
    approximately equal installments in August 2010 and 2011,
    subject to the terms of the agreement. The results of operations
    of the acquiree have been included in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
    The purchase price allocation resulted in $5.6 million of
    identifiable intangible assets, a significant portion of which
    were attributable to the network of subagents acquired by the
    Company. The identifiable intangible assets are being amortized
    over three to seven years and goodwill of $14.2 million was
    recorded, which is not expected to be deductible for income tax
    purposes.

In October 2007, the Company entered into agreements totaling
    $18.3 million to convert its non-participating interest in
    an agent in Singapore to a fully participating 49% equity
    interest and to extend the agent relationship at more favorable
    commission rates to Western Union. As a result, the Company
    earns a pro-rata share of profits and has enhanced voting
    rights. The Company also has the right to add additional agent
    relationships in Singapore. In addition, in October 2007, the
    Company completed an agreement to acquire a 25% ownership
    interest in an agent in Jamaica and to extend the term of the
    agent relationship for $29.0 million. The aggregate
    consideration paid resulted in $20.2 million of
    identifiable intangible assets for these two investments,
    including capitalized contract costs, which are being amortized
    over seven to 10 years. Western Union’s investments in
    these agents are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting.

Restructuring
    and Related Expenses

Missouri
    and Texas Closures

During 2008, the Company closed substantially all of its
    facilities in Missouri and Texas and did not renew the
    Company’s collective bargaining agreement with the
    unionized workers employed at these locations.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The decision also resulted in the elimination of certain
    management positions in these same facilities and resulted,
    along with other actions, in the Company no longer having
    employees working in the United States under a collective
    bargaining agreement.

The Company incurred severance and employee related benefit
    expenses for all union and certain affected management
    employees, facility closure expenses and other expenses
    associated with the relocation of these operations to existing
    Company facilities and third-party providers, including costs
    related to hiring, training, relocation, travel and professional
    fees.

The Company incurred cumulative total expenses of
    $46.3 million comprised of $13.1 million,
    $7.3 million, $7.8 million and $18.1 million in
    severance and other employee related costs, asset write-offs and
    incremental depreciation, lease terminations and other
    restructuring expenses, respectively, through December 31,
    2008. No additional restructuring and related expenses were
    incurred in the year ended December 31, 2009.

Other
    Reorganizations

Also during 2008, in addition to the Missouri and Texas
    closures, the Company restructured some of its operations and
    relocated or eliminated certain shared service and call center
    positions. The relocated positions were moved to the
    Company’s existing facilities or outsourced service
    providers in 2008.

The Company incurred cumulative total expenses of
    $36.6 million comprised of $31.2 million,
    $0.6 million and $4.8 million in severance and other
    employee related costs, asset write-offs and incremental
    depreciation and other restructuring expenses, respectively,
    through December 31, 2008. No additional restructuring and
    related expenses were incurred in the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Total
    Plans

At December 31, 2008, the Company had a restructuring
    accrual of $25.8 million related to these plans, of which
    $24.8 million represented an accrual for severance and
    employee related expenses. During 2009, substantially all of the
    accruals were paid resulting in a remaining restructuring
    accrual which was immaterial at December 31, 2009. The
    Company did not incur any material restructuring and related
    expenses in the year ended December 31, 2009. Restructuring
    and related expenses were reflected in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2008 as
    follows (in millions):

While these items were identifiable to the Company’s
    segments, these expenses were excluded from the measurement of
    segment operating profit provided to the chief operating
    decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. Of the Company’s total restructuring and
    related expenses of $82.9 million, $56.1 million,
    $23.4 million and $3.4 million are attributable to the
    Company’s

consumer-to-consumer,

global business payments and other segments, respectively.

Related
    Party Transactions

The Company has ownership interests in certain of its agents
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company
    pays these agents, as it does its other agents, commissions for
    money transfer and other services provided on the Company’s
    behalf. Commission expense recognized for these agents for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled
    $203.2 million, $305.9 million and
    $256.6 million, respectively. For those agents where an
    ownership interest was acquired during 2007, only amounts paid
    subsequent to the investment date have been reflected as a
    related party transaction. Commission expense recognized for
    FEXCO prior to February 24, 2009, the date of the
    acquisition (see Note 3), was considered a related party
    transaction.

In July 2009, the Company appointed a director who is also a
    director for a company holding significant investments in two of
    the Company’s existing agents. These agents had been agents
    of the Company prior to the director being appointed to the
    board. The Company recognized commission expense of
    $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    related to these agents.

6.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Letters
    of Credit and Bank Guarantees

The Company had $88.0 million in outstanding letters of
    credit and bank guarantees at December 31, 2009 with
    expiration dates through 2015, certain of which contain a
    one-year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank
    guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease
    arrangements and certain agent agreements. The Company expects
    to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to
    expiration in most circumstances.

Litigation
    and Related Contingencies

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated
    agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona. On
    February 11, 2010, the Company signed this agreement and
    settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and
    claims with the State and requires the Company to fund a
    multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. The accrual includes
    amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs
    associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the
    agreement and settlement, the Company expects to make certain
    investments in its compliance programs along the United States
    and Mexico border and to engage a monitor of that program, which
    are expected to cost up to $23 million over the next two to
    four years. While the $71.0 million in charges were
    identifiable to the Company’s

consumer-to-consumer

segment, they were not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation.

The United States Department of Justice served one of our
    subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents in
    connection with an investigation into money transfers from the
    United States to the Dominican Republic during the last several
    years. The Company is cooperating fully with the DOJ
    investigation. Due to the stage of the DOJ investigation, the
    Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation or
    the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with the
    resolution of any charges that may be brought against the
    Company.

In the normal course of business, Western Union is subject to
    claims and litigation. Management of Western Union believes such
    matters involving a reasonably possible chance of loss will not,
    individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse
    effect on Western Union’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. Western Union accrues for loss
    contingencies as they become probable and estimable.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In May 2007, the Company initiated litigation against MoneyGram
    Payment Systems, Inc. (“MoneyGram”) for infringement
    of the Company’s Money Transfer by Phone patents by
    MoneyGram’s FormFree service. On September 24, 2009, a
    jury found that MoneyGram was liable for patent infringement and
    awarded the Company $16.5 million in damages. This case is
    on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
    Circuit. In accordance with its policies, the Company does not
    recognize gain contingencies in earnings until realization and
    collectability are assured and, therefore, due to
    MoneyGram’s challenges to the verdict, the Company has not
    recognized any amounts in its Consolidated Statement of Income
    through December 31, 2009.

Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with First
    Data in connection with the Spin-off, First Data and the Company
    are each liable for, and agreed to perform, all liabilities with
    respect to their respective businesses. In addition, the
    separation and distribution agreement also provides for
    cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial
    responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the
    Company’s business with the Company and financial
    responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of First
    Data’s retained businesses with First Data. The Company
    also entered into a tax allocation agreement that sets forth the
    rights and obligations of First Data and the Company with
    respect to taxes imposed on their respective businesses both
    prior to and after the Spin-off as well as potential tax
    obligations for which the Company may be liable in conjunction
    with the Spin-off (see Note 10).

Investment
    Securities

Investment securities, classified within “Settlement
    assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist
    primarily of high-quality state and municipal debt obligations.
    Substantially all of the Company’s investment securities
    were marketable securities during the periods presented. The
    Company is required to maintain specific high-quality,
    investment grade securities and such investments are restricted
    to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with
    applicable state and foreign country requirements. Western Union
    does not hold investment securities for trading purposes. All
    investment securities are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at fair value. Investment securities are exposed to
    market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk.
    Western Union regularly monitors credit risk and attempts to
    mitigate its exposure by making high-quality investments and
    through investment diversification. At December 31, 2009,
    the majority of the Company’s investment securities had
    credit ratings of “AA-” or better from a major credit
    rating agency.

Effective October 1, 2009 (the “Transition
    Date”), in accordance with the agreement signed on
    July 18, 2008, IPS, a subsidiary of First Data, assigned
    and transferred to the Company certain operating assets used by
    IPS to issue Western Union branded money orders and
    approximately $860 million of cash sufficient to satisfy
    all outstanding money order liabilities. On the Transition Date,
    the Company assumed IPS’s role as issuer of the money
    orders, including its obligation to pay outstanding money
    orders, and terminated the existing agreement whereby IPS paid
    Western Union a fixed return of 5.5% on the outstanding money
    order balances. Following the Transition Date, Western Union
    invested the cash received from IPS in high-quality, investment
    grade securities, primarily tax exempt United States state and
    municipal securities, in accordance with applicable regulations,
    which are the same as those currently governing the investment
    of the Company’s United States originated money transfer
    principal. Prior to the Transition Date, the Company had entered
    into interest rate swaps on certain of its fixed rate notes to
    reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Through a
    combination of the revenue generated from these investment
    securities and the anticipated interest expense savings
    resulting from the interest rate swaps, the Company estimates
    that it should be able to retain, subsequent to the Transition
    Date, a materially comparable after-tax rate of return through
    2011 as it was receiving under its agreement with IPS. Refer to
    Note 14 for additional information on the interest rate
    swaps.

Subsequent to the Transition Date, all revenue generated from
    the investment portfolio is being retained by the Company. IPS
    continues to provide the Company with clearing services
    necessary for payment of the money orders in exchange for the
    payment by the Company to IPS of a per-item processing fee. The
    Company



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

no longer provides to IPS the services required under the
    original money order agreement or receives from IPS the fee for
    such services.

In 2008, the Company began increasing its investment levels in
    various state and municipal variable rate demand note securities
    which can be put (sold at par) typically on a daily basis with
    settlement periods ranging from the same day to one week, but
    that have varying maturities through 2048. Generally, these
    securities are used by the Company for short-term liquidity
    needs and are held for short periods of time, typically less
    than 30 days. As a result, this has increased the frequency
    of purchases and proceeds received by the Company.

Unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities are excluded from earnings and presented as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net
    of related deferred taxes. Proceeds from the sale and maturity
    of

available-for-sale

securities during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 were $8.4 billion, $2.8 billion and
    $0.2 billion, respectively.

Gains and losses on investments are calculated using the
    specific-identification method and are recognized during the
    period in which the investment is sold or when an investment
    experiences an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. Factors that could indicate an impairment
    exists include, but are not limited to: earnings performance,
    changes in credit rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or
    economic environment of the asset. If potential impairment
    exists, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell
    the debt security, more likely than not will be required to sell
    the debt security before its anticipated recovery or expects
    that some of the contractual cash flows will not be received.
    The Company had no material

other-than-temporary

impairments during the periods presented.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair value, as defined by the relevant accounting standards,
    represents the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. For additional information on how Western
    Union measures fair value, refer to Note 2, “Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The carrying amounts for Western Union financial instruments,
    including cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash
    equivalents, settlement receivables and settlement obligations
    approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The
    Company’s borrowings had a carrying value and fair value of
    $3,048.5 million and $3,211.3 million, respectively,
    at December 31, 2009 and had a carrying value and fair

Receivable
    for securities sold

On September 15, 2008, Western Union requested redemption
    of its shares in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd.
    (the “Fund”), a money market fund, totaling
    $298.1 million. Western Union included the value of the
    receivable in “Other assets” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. At the time the redemption request was made, the
    Company was informed by the Reserve Management Company, the
    Fund’s investment advisor (the “Manager”), that
    the Company’s redemption trades would be honored at a $1.00
    per share net asset value. In 2009, the Company received partial
    distributions totaling $255.5 million from the Fund. The
    Company continues to vigorously pursue collection of the
    remaining balance and believes it has a right to full payment of
    the remaining amount based on the written and verbal
    representations from the Manager and the Company’s legal
    position. However, given the increased uncertainty surrounding
    the numerous third-party legal



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

claims associated with the Fund, the Company reserved
    $12 million representing the estimated impact of a pro-rata
    distribution of the Fund during 2009. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company had a remaining receivable balance of
    $30.6 million, net of the related reserve. If further
    deterioration occurs in the underlying assets in the Fund, or if
    the Fund incurs significant legal

and/or

administrative costs during the distribution process, the
    Company may record additional reserves related to the remaining
    receivable balance, which could negatively affect its financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Amounts
    advanced to agents, net of discounts

From time to time, the Company makes advances and loans to
    agents. In 2006, the Company signed a six year agreement with
    one of its existing agents which included a four year loan of
    $140.0 million to the agent. The remaining loan receivable
    balance at December 31, 2009 was $16.9 million, which
    was fully repaid in January 2010. At December 31, 2008, the
    note had a receivable balance of $47.0 million, net of a
    discount of $3.0 million, which represented imputed
    interest on this below-market rate note receivable. Other
    advances and loans outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008 were $20.6 million and $22.3 million,
    respectively.

NOTES TO

The Company continues to benefit from an increasing proportion
    of profits being foreign-derived and therefore taxed at lower
    rates than its combined federal and state tax rates in the
    United States. In addition, in the second quarter of 2008, the
    Company implemented additional foreign tax efficient strategies
    consistent with its overall tax planning which impacted its
    effective tax rate for all subsequent periods.

Uncertain
    Tax Positions

The Company has established contingency reserves for material,
    known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments
    with respect to its international operations, which were
    restructured in 2003. The Company’s tax reserves reflect
    management’s judgment as to the resolution of the issues
    involved if subject to judicial review. While the Company
    believes its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected
    tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an
    issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With
    respect to these reserves, the Company’s income tax expense
    would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from
    material changes during the period in the facts and
    circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue
    and (ii) any difference from the Company’s tax
    position as recorded in the financial statements and the final
    resolution of a tax issue during the period.

The Company adopted an accounting standard relating to the
    accounting for and disclosure of uncertain tax positions on
    January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of applying this
    standard resulted in a reduction of $0.6 million to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of
    differences between tax return positions and the amounts
    otherwise recognized in the Company’s financial statements,
    and are reflected in “Income taxes payable” in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
    interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):

(a)

Includes recurring accruals for issues which initially arose in
    previous periods.

(b)

Changes to positions taken in prior periods relate to changes in
    estimates used to calculate prior period unrecognized tax
    benefits.

A substantial portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefits relate to the 2003 restructuring of the Company’s
    international operations whereby the Company’s income from
    certain

foreign-to-foreign

money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low
    foreign tax rates compared to the Company’s combined
    federal and state tax rates in the United States. The total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
    affect the effective tax rate was $468.6 million and
    $352.4 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, excluding interest and penalties.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties with respect to
    unrecognized tax benefits in “Provision for income
    taxes” in its Consolidated Statements of Income, and
    records the associated liability in “Income taxes
    payable” in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company
    recognized $11.0 million, $11.6 million and
    $13.5 million in interest and penalties during the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    Company has accrued $45.5 million and $35.8 million
    for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Subject to the matter referenced in the paragraph below, the
    Company has identified no other uncertain tax positions for
    which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or
    decrease within 12 months, except for recurring accruals on
    existing uncertain tax positions. The change in unrecognized tax
    benefits during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008
    is substantially attributable to such recurring accruals.

The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns for the United
    States, for multiple states and localities, and for various

non-United

States jurisdictions, and the Company has identified the United
    States and Ireland as its two major tax jurisdictions. The
    United States federal income tax returns of First Data, which
    include



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the Company, are eligible to be examined for the years 2002
    through 2006. The Company’s United States federal income
    tax returns since the Spin-off are also eligible to be examined.
    The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has
    issued a report of the results of its examination of the United
    States federal consolidated income tax return of First Data for
    2002, and the Company believes that the resolution of the
    adjustments that affect the Company proposed in the report will
    not result in a material change to the Company’s financial
    position. In addition, the IRS completed its examination of the
    United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First
    Data for 2003 and 2004, which included the Company, and issued a
    Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency
    alleges significant additional taxes, interest and penalties
    owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving the
    Company and its subsidiaries, and the Company generally has
    responsibility for taxes associated with these potential
    Company-related adjustments under the tax allocation agreement
    with First Data executed at the time of the Spin-off. The
    Company agrees with a number of the adjustments in the Notice of
    Deficiency; however, the Company does not agree with the Notice
    of Deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments
    representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of
    approximately $114 million. As of December 31, 2009,
    interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments
    would be approximately $30 million. A substantial part of
    the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates
    to the Company’s international restructuring, which took
    effect in the fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the alleged
    amounts due related to such restructuring largely are
    attributable to 2004. On March 20, 2009, the Company filed
    a petition in the United States Tax Court contesting those
    adjustments with which it does not agree. The Company believes
    its overall reserves are adequate, including those associated
    with the adjustments alleged in the Notice of Deficiency. If the
    IRS’ position in the Notice of Deficiency is sustained, the
    Company’s tax provision related to 2003 and later years
    would materially increase. The IRS has now commenced an
    examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax
    returns of First Data that cover the Company’s 2005 and
    pre-spin-off 2006 taxable periods and also has commenced an
    examination of the Company’s federal consolidated income
    tax return for the post-spin-off 2006 period. The Irish income
    tax returns of certain subsidiaries for the years 2005 and
    forward are eligible to be examined by the Irish tax
    authorities, although no examinations have commenced.

At December 31, 2009, no provision had been made for United
    States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of
    approximately $2.0 billion, which are expected to be
    reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. Upon
    distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form
    of actual or constructive dividends, the Company would be
    subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment
    for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible
    withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
    Determination of this amount of unrecognized deferred United
    States tax liability is not practicable because of the
    complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Tax
    Allocation Agreement with First Data

The Company and First Data each are liable for taxes imposed on
    their respective businesses both prior to and after the
    Spin-off. If such taxes have not been appropriately apportioned
    between First Data and the Company, subsequent adjustments may
    occur that may impact the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations.

Also under the tax allocation agreement, with respect to taxes
    and other liabilities that result from a final determination
    that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of
    the Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and
    relevant tax opinion), (“Spin-off Related Taxes”), the
    Company will be liable to First Data for any such Spin-off
    Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by or with
    respect to the Company. In addition, the Company will also be
    liable for 50% of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that would
    not have been imposed but for the existence of both an action by
    the Company and an action by First Data or (ii) where the
    Company and First Data each take actions that, standing alone,
    would have resulted in the imposition of such Spin-off Related
    Taxes. The Company may be similarly liable if it breaches
    certain



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

representations or covenants set forth in the tax allocation
    agreement. If the Company is required to indemnify First Data
    for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin-off being taxable to
    First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s business, financial position and results of
    operations. First Data generally will be liable for all Spin-off
    Related Taxes, other than those described above.

11.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined
    Contribution Plans

The Western Union Company Incentive Savings Plan
    (“401(k)”) covers eligible employees on the United
    States payroll of Western Union. Employees who make voluntary
    contributions to this plan receive up to a 4% Western Union
    matching contribution. All matching contributions are
    immediately 100% vested.

On September 30, 2009, the Company merged its defined
    contribution plan covering its former union employees and
    transferred the plan assets into the 401(k).

The Company administers more than 20 defined contribution plans
    in various countries globally on behalf of approximately
    1,000 employee participants as of December 31, 2009.
    Such plans have vesting and employer contribution provisions
    that vary by country.

In addition, Western Union sponsors a non-qualified deferred
    compensation plan for a select group of highly compensated
    employees. The plan provides tax-deferred contributions,
    matching and the restoration of Company matching contributions
    otherwise limited under the 401(k).

The aggregate amount charged to expense in connection with all
    of the above plans was $11.2 million, $12.5 million
    and $11.6 million during the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Defined
    Benefit Plans

The Company has two frozen defined benefit pension plans
    (“Plans”) for which it had a recorded unfunded pension
    obligation of $124.2 million as of December 31, 2009,
    included in “Other liabilities” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Due to the closure of one of its facilities in
    Missouri (see Note 4) and a recent agreement with the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Company funded
    $4.1 million into one of its subsidiary’s pension
    plans during 2009. No contributions were made to these plans by
    Western Union during the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007. Pursuant to final guidance issued by the IRS in September
    2009, the Company made certain interest rate elections under the
    Pension Protection Act which will require it to fund
    approximately $15 million to the plans in 2010, which is
    less than was previously anticipated. In addition, the Company
    may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately
    $10 million for a total contribution of $25 million to
    the plans in 2010.

In connection with the adoption of an accounting standard,
    effective January 1, 2008, the Company changed its plan
    measurement date to December 31. In connection with the
    Company’s change in measurement date, the Company prepared
    a

15-month

projection of net periodic benefit income for the period from
    October 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. The
    pro-rated portion of net periodic benefit income of
    $0.1 million for the period from October 1, 2007
    through December 31, 2007 was reflected as an increase to
    “Retained earnings” on January 1, 2008.

The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension plans in
    its Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment
    to “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” net of tax.

    interest costs of $6.1 million, offset by $6.2 million
    which represents the expected return on plan assets less
    amortization of the actuarial loss.

Differences in expected returns on plan assets estimated at the
    beginning of the year versus actual returns, and assumptions
    used to estimate the beginning of year projected benefit
    obligation versus the end of year obligation (principally
    discount rate and mortality assumptions) are, on a combined
    basis, considered actuarial gains and losses. Such actuarial
    gains and losses are recognized as a component of
    “Comprehensive income” and amortized to income over
    the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants.
    Included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at
    December 31, 2009 is $6.2 million ($3.9 million,
    net of tax) of actuarial losses that are expected to be
    recognized in net periodic pension cost during the year ended

During 2008, the Company recorded $2.8 million of expense
    relating to the termination of certain retirement eligible union
    and management plan participants in connection with the
    restructuring and related activities disclosed in Note 4.

The accrued loss related to the pension liability included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax,
    increased/(decreased) $11.3 million, $46.4 million and
    ($15.3) million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    significant comprehensive loss in 2008 was caused by a decline
    in the fair value of plan assets, which was primarily
    attributable to a decrease in the value of the equity securities
    within the plan asset portfolio.

The weighted-average rate assumptions used in the measurement of
    the Company’s benefit obligation were as follows:

Western Union measures the Plan’s obligations and annual
    expense using assumptions that reflect best estimates and are
    consistent to the extent that each assumption reflects
    expectations of future economic conditions. As the bulk of the
    pension benefits will not be paid for many years, the
    computation of pension expenses and benefits is based on
    assumptions about future interest rates and expected rates of
    return on plan assets. In general, pension obligations are most
    sensitive to the discount rate assumption, and it is set based
    on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled
    effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the
    timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the plans to the
    rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived
    from AA bonds of varying maturities.

Western Union employs a building block approach in determining
    the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets
    are studied and long-term historical relationships between
    equities and fixed-income securities are considered consistent
    with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets
    with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long
    run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates
    are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
    determined. Consideration is given to diversification,
    re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities
    held. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for
    reasonableness and appropriateness. The Company then applies
    this rate against a calculated value for its plan assets. The
    calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan
    assets over a five-year period.

    return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed
    income investments are used in an effort to maximize the
    long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
    Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of
    plan liabilities and plan funded status. The investment
    portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and
    fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are
    diversified across United States and

non-United

States stocks, as well as securities deemed to be growth, value,
    and small and large capitalizations. Other assets, primarily
    private equity, are used judiciously in an effort to enhance
    long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. The
    Company’s defined benefit plans also include certain
    derivatives. On behalf of the Plans, investment advisors may
    enter into futures contracts to manage interest rate risks.
    These contracts are contractual obligations to buy or sell a
    United States treasury bond or note at predetermined future
    dates and prices. Futures are transacted in standardized amounts
    on regulated exchanges. Investment risk is measured and
    monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment
    portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic
    asset and liability studies.

The following table reflects investments of the Trust that were
    measured and carried at fair value as of December 31, 2009

Stockholders’
    Equity

Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes all changes in
    equity during a period that have yet to be recognized in income,
    except those resulting from transactions with shareholders. The
    major components include foreign currency translation
    adjustments, pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and
    losses on investment securities and gains or losses from cash
    flow hedging activities.

Unrealized gains and losses on investment securities that are
    available for sale, primarily municipal securities, are included
    in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the investment is
    either sold or deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired. See Note 7 for further discussion.

The effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives
    that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss. Generally, amounts are recognized in
    income when the related forecasted transaction affects earnings.
    See Note 14 for further discussion.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose
    functional currency is not the United States dollar are
    translated using the appropriate exchange rate as of the end of
    the year. Foreign currency translation adjustments represent
    unrealized gains and losses on assets and liabilities arising
    from the difference in the foreign country currency compared to
    the United States dollar. These gains and losses are accumulated
    in comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is
    substantially liquidated, the cumulative translation gain or
    loss is removed from “Accumulated other comprehensive
    loss” and is recognized as a component of the gain or loss
    on the sale of the subsidiary.

A pension liability adjustment associated with our defined
    benefit pension plans is recognized for the difference between
    estimated assumptions (e.g., asset returns, discount rates,
    mortality) and actual results. The amount in “Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss” is amortized to income over the
    remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Details of
    the pension plans’ assets and obligations are explained
    further in Note 11.

Cash
    Dividends Paid

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company’s Board of
    Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common
    share representing $41.2 million in total dividends. During
    the fourth quarter of 2008



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

and 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors declared an
    annual dividend of $0.04 per common share representing
    $28.4 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in
    total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of
    record in December of each respective year.

On February 25, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable on
    March 31, 2010 to shareholders of record on March 19,
    2010.

Share
    Repurchases

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    24.8 million, 58.1 million and 34.7 million
    shares, respectively, have been repurchased for
    $400.0 million, $1,313.9 million and
    $726.5 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an
    average cost of $16.10, $22.60 and $20.93 per share,
    respectively. At December 31, 2009, common stock
    repurchases of up to $1.0 billion have been authorized by
    the Board of Directors through December 31, 2012.

During December 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    adopted resolutions to retire all of its existing treasury
    stock, thereby restoring the status of the Company’s common
    stock held in treasury as “authorized but unissued”.
    The resulting impact to the Company’s Consolidated Balance
    Sheet was the elimination of $462.0 million held in
    “Treasury stock” and a decrease in “Common
    stock” of $0.2 million and “Retained
    earnings” of $461.8 million. There is no change to the
    Company’s overall equity position as a result of this
    retirement. All shares repurchased by the Company subsequent to
    this resolution have been and will continue to be retired at the
    time such shares are reacquired.

14.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
    resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the
    euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar
    and other currencies, related to forecasted money transfer
    revenues and on money transfer settlement assets and
    obligations. Subsequent to the acquisition of Custom House, the
    Company is also exposed to risk from derivative contracts
    written to its customers arising from its cross-currency

business-to-business

payments operations. Additionally, the Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk related to changes in market rates both prior
    to and subsequent to the issuance of debt. The Company uses
    derivatives to (a) minimize its exposures related to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates
    and (b) facilitate cross-currency

business-to-business

payments by writing derivatives to customers and entering into
    offsetting derivatives with established financial institution
    counterparties, or by holding sufficient foreign currency cash
    balances to cover those transactions. Foreign currency forward
    and option contracts and interest rate swaps of varying
    maturities are used in these activities.

The Company executes the

consumer-to-consumer

derivatives with established financial institutions, with the
    substantial majority of these financial institutions having
    credit ratings of “A-” or better from a major credit
    rating agency. The Company executes global business payments
    derivatives mostly with small and medium size enterprises. The
    credit risk inherent in both the

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments agreements represents the
    possibility that a loss may occur from the nonperformance of a
    counterparty to the agreements. The Company performs a review of
    the credit risk of these counterparties at the inception of the
    contract and on an ongoing basis. The Company also monitors the
    concentration of its contracts with any individual counterparty.
    The Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to
    fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements, but takes
    action (including termination of contracts) when doubt arises
    about the counterparties’ ability to perform. The
    Company’s hedged foreign currency exposures are in liquid
    currencies, consequently there is minimal risk that appropriate
    derivatives to maintain the hedging program would not be
    available in the future.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Foreign

Currency—Consumer-to-Consumer

The Company’s policy is to use longer-term foreign currency
    forward contracts, with maturities of up to 36 months at
    inception and a targeted weighted-average maturity of
    approximately one year, to mitigate some of the risk that
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the
    United States dollar could have on forecasted revenues
    denominated in other currencies related to its business. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s longer-term foreign
    currency forward contracts had maturities of a maximum of
    24 months with a weighted-average maturity of approximately
    one year. The Company assesses the effectiveness of these
    foreign currency forward contracts based on changes in the spot
    rate of the affected currencies during the period of
    designation. Accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the
    hedges not considered effective or portions of the hedge that
    are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized
    immediately in “Derivative (losses)/gains, net” within
    the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company also uses short duration foreign currency forward
    contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one
    month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on
    settlement assets and obligations between initiation and
    settlement. In addition, forward contracts, typically with
    maturities of less than one year, are utilized to offset foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated cash positions. None of these contracts are
    designated as accounting hedges.

The aggregate United States dollar notional amounts of foreign
    currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2009 were as
    follows (in millions):

Contracts not designated as hedges:

Foreign
    Currency—Global Business Payments

As a result of the acquisition of Custom House, the Company
    writes derivatives, primarily foreign currency forward contracts
    and, to a much smaller degree, option contracts, mostly with
    small and medium size enterprises (customer contracts) and
    derives a currency spread from this activity as part of its
    global business payments operations. In this capacity, the
    Company facilitates cross-currency payment transactions for its
    customers but aggregates its Custom House foreign currency
    exposures arising from customer contracts, including the
    derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting
    net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with
    established financial institution counterparties (economic hedge
    contracts). The derivatives written are part of the broader
    portfolio of foreign currency positions arising from its
    cross-currency

business-to-business

payments operation, which includes significant spot exchanges of
    currency in addition to forwards and options. None of these
    contracts are designated as accounting hedges. The duration of
    these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less.

The aggregate United States dollar notional amounts of foreign
    currency derivative customer contracts held by the Company as of
    December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.0 billion. The
    significant majority of customer contracts are written in major
    currencies such as the Canadian dollar, euro, Australian dollar
    and the British pound.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company also entered into a forward contract, with a
    notional amount of approximately 230 million Canadian
    dollars ($220 million), to offset foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations on a Canadian dollar denominated position in
    connection with the purchase of Custom House. This contract is
    not designated as an accounting hedge.

Interest
    Rate Hedging—Corporate

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to effectively change
    the interest rate payments on a portion of its notes from
    fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
    payments in order to manage its overall exposure to interest
    rates. The Company designates these derivatives as fair value
    hedges utilizing the short-cut method, which permits an
    assumption of no ineffectiveness if certain criteria are met.
    The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps is offset by
    a change in the balance of the debt being hedged within the
    Company’s “Borrowings” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and “Interest expense” in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income has been adjusted to include
    the effects of interest accrued on the swaps.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held interest
    rate swaps in an aggregate notional amount of $750 million
    and $660 million, respectively.

    $1.5 billion thereafter.

The Company’s obligations with respect to its outstanding
    borrowings, as described below, rank equally.

Commercial
    Paper Program

On November 3, 2006, the Company established a commercial
    paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue unsecured
    commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”)
    in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any
    time. The Commercial Paper Notes may have maturities of up to
    397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for
    borrowings are based on market rates at the time of

    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

issuance. The Company’s commercial paper borrowings at
    December 31, 2008 had weighted-average interest rates of
    approximately 4.1% and weighted-average initial terms of
    27 days. The Company had no commercial paper borrowings
    outstanding at December 31, 2009.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

On September 27, 2006, the Company entered into a five-year
    unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a
    $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a
    $250.0 million letter of credit

sub-facility

and a $150.0 million swing line

sub-facility

(the “Revolving Credit Facility”). On
    September 28, 2007, the Company entered into an amended and
    restated credit agreement, the primary purpose of which was to
    extend the maturity by one year from its original five-year
    $1.5 billion facility entered into in 2006. No other
    material changes were made in the amended and restated facility.
    The Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a
    group of 15 participating institutions, is used to meet
    additional liquidity needs that might arise for the Company and
    to support borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper
    program. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain
    covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the
    ability of the Company and other significant subsidiaries to
    grant certain types of security interests, incur debt or enter
    into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company is also
    required to maintain compliance with a consolidated interest
    coverage ratio covenant.

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for
    the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms
    of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a
    selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of
    19 basis points. A facility fee of 6 basis points on
    the total facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of
    usage. The facility fee percentage is determined based on
    certain of the Company’s credit ratings. In addition, to
    the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the
    Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related aggregate
    commitments, a utilization fee of 5 basis points as of
    December 31, 2009 based upon such ratings is payable to the
    lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $1.5 billion
    available to borrow, as the Company had no commercial paper
    borrowings outstanding.

Term
    Loan

On December 5, 2008, the Company entered into a senior,
    unsecured,

364-day

term
    loan in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million with
    a syndicate of lenders. The Term Loan was paid and financed with
    the issuance of the 2014 Notes on February 26, 2009.

Notes

On February 26, 2009, the Company issued $500 million
    of aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes to repay the
    balance of the Term Loan which was scheduled to mature in
    December 2009. Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is
    payable semiannually on February 26 and August 26 each year
    based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.500%. The 2014
    Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit or
    restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its
    subsidiaries to grant certain types of security interests or
    enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may
    redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the
    greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate
    plus 50 basis points.

On November 17, 2006, the Company issued $2 billion
    aggregate principal amount of the Company’s unsecured fixed
    and floating rate notes, comprised of $500 million
    aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Floating Rate
    Notes due 2008 (the “Floating Rate Notes”),
    $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.400% Notes
    due 2011 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.200% Notes due 2036 (the “2036 Notes”). The
    Floating Rate Notes were redeemed upon maturity in November 2008.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is
    payable semiannually on May 17 and November 17 each year based
    on fixed per annum interest rates of 5.400% and 6.200%,
    respectively. The indenture governing the 2011 Notes and 2036
    Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit or
    restrict the ability of the Company and other significant
    subsidiaries to grant certain types of security interests, incur
    debt (in the case of significant subsidiaries), or enter into
    sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may redeem the 2011
    Notes and the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the
    greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate
    plus 15 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.

On September 29, 2006, the Company issued $1.0 billion
    aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on
    October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable
    semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on a fixed
    per annum interest rate of 5.930%. The indenture governing the
    2016 Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit or
    restrict the ability of the Company and other significant
    subsidiaries to grant certain types of security interests, incur
    debt (in the case of significant subsidiaries) or enter into
    sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may redeem the 2016
    Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a
    price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis
    points.

The
    Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    (“2006 LTIP”) provides for the granting of stock
    options, restricted stock awards and units, unrestricted stock
    awards, and other equity-based awards to employees who perform
    services for the Company. A maximum of 120.0 million shares
    of common stock may be awarded under the 2006 LTIP, of which
    34.6 million shares are available as of December 31,
    2009.

Options granted under the 2006 LTIP are issued with exercise
    prices equal to the fair value of Western Union common stock on
    the grant date, have

10-year

terms, and vest over four equal annual increments beginning
    12 months after the date of grant. Compensation expense
    related to stock options is recognized over the requisite
    service period. The requisite service period for stock options
    is the same as the vesting period, with the exception of
    retirement eligible employees, who have shorter requisite
    service periods ending when the employees become retirement
    eligible.

Restricted stock awards and units granted under the 2006 LTIP
    typically become 100% vested on the three year anniversary of
    the grant date. The fair value of the awards granted is measured
    based on the fair value of the shares on the date of grant.
    Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of
    dividend equivalents. For those grants, the value of the grants
    is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend
    equivalent payments. The related compensation expense is
    recognized over the requisite service period which is the same
    as the vesting period.

In February 2009, the Compensation Committee of the
    Company’s board of directors granted the Company’s
    executives long-term incentive awards under the 2006 LTIP which
    consisted of one-third restricted stock units, one-third stock
    option awards and one-third performance-based cash awards. The
    performance-based cash awards are based on strategic performance
    objectives for 2009 and 2010 and are payable in equal
    installments on the second and third anniversaries of the award,
    assuming the applicable performance objectives are satisfied.
    Based on their contributions to the Company and additional
    assumed responsibilities, certain executives received an
    incremental grant of restricted stock units which fully vest on
    the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Additionally,
    non-executive employees of the Company participating in the 2006
    LTIP received annual equity grants of 50% stock option awards
    and 50% restricted stock units, representing a change from the
    75% stock option awards and 25% restricted stock awards or units
    previously granted under the 2006 LTIP.

The
    Western Union Company 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity
    Compensation Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity
    Compensation Plan (“2006 Director Plan”) provides
    for the granting of equity-based awards to non-employee
    directors of the Company. Options granted under the
    2006 Director Plan are issued with exercise prices equal to
    the fair value of Western Union common stock at the grant date,
    have

10-year

terms, and vest immediately. Since options and deferred stock
    units under this plan vest immediately, compensation expense is
    recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of the
    awards when granted. Awards under the plan may be settled
    immediately unless the participant elects to defer the receipt
    of the common shares under applicable plan rules. A maximum of
    1.5 million shares of common stock may be awarded under the
    2006 Director Plan. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company has issued 0.5 million options and 0.2 million
    unrestricted stock units to non-employee directors of the
    Company.

Impact
    of Spin-Off to Stock—Based Awards Granted Under First Data
    Plans

At the time of the Spin-off, First Data converted stock options,
    restricted stock awards and restricted stock units
    (collectively, “Stock-Based Awards”) of First Data
    stock held by Western Union and First Data employees. For
    Western Union employees, each outstanding First Data Stock-Based
    Award was converted to new Western Union Stock-Based Awards. For
    First Data employees, each outstanding First Data Stock-Based
    Award held prior to the Spin-off was converted into one
    replacement First Data Stock-Based Award and one Western Union
    Stock-Based Award. The new Western Union and First Data
    Stock-Based Awards maintained their pre-conversion aggregate
    intrinsic values, and, in the case of stock options, their ratio
    of the exercise price per share to their fair value per share.

All converted Stock-Based Awards, which had not vested prior to
    September 24, 2007, were subject to the terms and
    conditions applicable to the original First Data Stock-Based
    Awards, including change of control provisions which required
    full vesting upon a change of control of First Data.
    Accordingly, upon the completion of the acquisition of First
    Data on September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of Kohlberg
    Kravis Roberts & Co.’s (“KKR”), all of
    these remaining converted unvested Western Union Stock-Based
    Awards vested. In connection with this accelerated vesting, the
    Company incurred a non-cash pre-tax charge of $22.3 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2007 for such awards
    held by Western Union employees. Approximately one-third of this
    charge was recorded within “Cost of services” and
    two-thirds was recorded within “Selling, general and
    administrative expense” in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. As a result of this accelerated vesting, there is no
    remaining unamortized compensation expense associated with such
    converted Stock-Based Awards.

After the Spin-off, the Company receives all cash proceeds
    related to the exercise of all Western Union stock options, and
    recognizes all stock compensation expense and retains the
    resulting tax benefits relating to Western Union awards held by
    Western Union employees. First Data recognizes all stock-based
    compensation expense and retains all associated tax benefits for
    Western Union Stock-Based Awards held by First Data employees.

Expected volatility

—For the Company’s board of
    directors and executives, the expected volatility for the 2009,
    2008 and 2007 grants was 46.9%, 31.3% and 26.9%, respectively.
    The expected volatility for the Company’s non-executive
    employees was 46.0%, 31.9% and 22.8% for the 2009, 2008 and 2007
    grants, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, Western Union used a
    blend of implied and historical volatility. The Company’s
    implied volatility was calculated using the market price of
    traded options on Western Union’s common stock. In 2009,
    the historical volatility represented a blend of Western Union
    and First Data (prior to the Spin-off) stock data. In 2008, the
    historical volatility also included a peer group of companies in
    similar industries

and/or

market capitalizations. In 2007, Western Union’s volatility
    was determined based entirely on the calculated peer group
    historical volatility since there was not sufficient trading
    history for Western Union’s common stock or traded options.

Expected dividend yield

—The Company’s expected
    annual dividend yield is the calculation of the annualized
    Western Union dividend divided by a rolling 12 month
    average Western Union stock price on each



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

respective grant date. The 2009 grants do not reflect the
    increase in dividends approved by the Board of Directors on
    December 9, 2009 as all 2009 grants were issued prior to
    that date.

Expected term

— For 2009, Western Union’s
    expected term was 5.0 years for non-executive employees and
    6.7 years for the board of directors and executives. For
    2008 and 2007, Western Union’s expected term was
    5.8 years for non-executive employees and 7.5 years
    for the board of directors and executives. The Company’s
    expected term of options was based upon, among other things,
    historical exercises (including the exercise history of First
    Data’s awards), the vesting term of the Company’s
    options and the options’ contractual term of ten years.

Risk-free interest rate

—The risk-free rate for stock
    options granted during the period is determined by using a
    United States Treasury rate for the period that coincided with
    the expected terms listed above.

The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options
    granted will be evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect
    market conditions and the Company’s historical experience
    and future expectations. The calculated fair value is recognized
    as compensation cost in the Company’s financial statements
    over the requisite service period of the entire award.
    Compensation cost is recognized only for those options expected
    to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant and
    evaluated and adjusted periodically to reflect the
    Company’s historical experience and future expectations.
    Any change in the forfeiture assumption will be accounted for as
    a change in estimate, with the cumulative effect of the change
    on periods previously reported being reflected in the financial
    statements of the period in which the change is made. In the
    future, as more historical data is available to calculate the
    volatility of Western Union stock and the actual terms Western
    Union employees hold options, expected volatility and expected
    term may change which could change the grant-date fair value of
    future stock option awards and, ultimately, the recorded
    compensation expense.

Segments

As previously described in Note 1, the Company classifies
    its businesses into two reportable segments:

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments. Operating segments are defined as
    components of an enterprise that engage in business activities,
    about which separate financial information is available that is
    evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating
    decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding where to allocate
    resources and in assessing performance.

The

consumer-to-consumer

reporting segment is viewed as one global network where a money
    transfer can be sent from one location to another, anywhere in
    the world. The segment consists of three regions, which
    primarily coordinate agent network management and marketing
    activities. The CODM makes decisions regarding resource
    allocation and monitors performance based on specific corridors
    within and across these regions, but also reviews total revenue
    and operating profit of each region. These regions frequently
    interact on transactions with consumers and share processes,
    systems and licenses, thereby constituting one global

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer network. The regions and corridors generally
    offer the same services distributed by the same agent network,
    have the same types of customers, are subject to similar
    regulatory requirements, are processed on the same system and
    have similar economic characteristics, allowing the geographic
    regions to be aggregated into one reporting segment.

The global business payments (formerly

consumer-to-business)

segment processes payments from consumers or businesses to other
    businesses. The results of the Company’s existing

consumer-to-business

operations as well as the newly acquired Custom House business
    have been combined in this segment as both are focused on
    facilitating payments. For further information on Custom House,
    see Note 3, “Acquisitions.”

All businesses that have not been classified into

consumer-to-consumer

or global business payments are reported as “Other.”
    These businesses primarily include the Company’s money
    order services business.



THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s reportable segments are reviewed separately
    below because each reportable segment represents a strategic
    business unit that offers different products and serves
    different markets. The business segment measurements provided
    to, and evaluated by, the Company’s CODM are computed in
    accordance with the following principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments
    primarily based on a percentage of the segments’ revenue
    compared to total revenue.

•

Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions
    are included in “Other.”

•

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated
    agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona, which has
    not been allocated to the segments. On February 11, 2010,
    the Company signed an agreement and settlement which resolved
    all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and
    requires the Company to fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. While this item was
    identifiable to the Company’s

consumer-to-consumer

segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on the settlement
    accrual, refer to Note 6.

•

Restructuring and related activities of $82.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 were not allocated to the
    segments. While these items were identifiable to the
    Company’s segments, they were not included in the
    measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for
    purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making
    with respect to resource allocation. For additional information
    on restructuring and related activities refer to Note 4.

•

In connection with the change in control of First Data, the
    Company incurred an accelerated stock-based compensation vesting
    charge of $22.3 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Of the $22.3 million charge,
    $18.9 million, $3.0 million and $0.4 million were
    allocated to the

consumer-to-consumer,

global business payments and other segments, respectively.

•

The geographic split of revenue above for

consumer-to-consumer

is based upon the country where a money transfer is initiated
    and the country where a money transfer is paid with revenue
    being split 50% between the two countries. The geographic split
    of revenue above for global business payments is based upon the
    country where the transaction is initiated with 100% of the
    revenue allocated to that country. Long-lived assets, consisting
    of “Property and equipment, net,” are presented based
    upon the location of the assets.

A majority of Western Union’s

consumer-to-consumer

transactions involve at least one

non-United

States location. Based on the method used to attribute revenue
    between countries described in the paragraph above, no
    individual country outside the United States accounted for more
    than 10% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007. In addition, no individual agent or global
    business payments customer accounted for greater than 10% of
    revenue during these periods.

CONDENSED
    FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE REGISTRANT

THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis of
    Presentation

The Western Union Company (“the Parent”) is a holding
    company that conducts substantially all of its business
    operations through its subsidiaries. Under a parent company only
    presentation, the Parent’s investments in its consolidated
    subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of
    accounting, and the condensed financial statements do not
    present the financial statements of the Parent and its
    subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial statements
    should be read in conjunction with The Western Union
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2.

Restricted
    Net Assets

Certain assets of the Parent’s subsidiaries totaling
    approximately $190 million constitute restricted net
    assets, as there are legal or regulatory limitations on
    transferring such assets outside of the countries where the
    respective assets are located, or because they constitute
    undistributed earnings of affiliates of the Parent accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31,
    2009, the Parent is in a stockholders’ equity position of
    $353.5 million, and as such, all of the restricted net
    assets of the Parent’s subsidiaries currently exceeds 25%
    of the consolidated net assets of the Parent and its
    subsidiaries, thus requiring this Schedule I,
    “Condensed Financial Information of the Registrant.”

3.

Related
    Party Transactions

Excess cash generated from operations of the Parent’s
    subsidiaries that is not required to meet certain regulatory
    requirements is paid periodically to the Parent and is reflected
    as “Payable to subsidiaries, net” in the Condensed
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009. The Parent’s
    subsidiaries periodically distribute excess cash balances to the
    Parent in the form of a dividend, although the amounts of such
    dividends may vary from year to year.

The Parent files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax
    return, and also a number of consolidated state income tax
    returns on behalf of its subsidiaries. In these circumstances,
    the Parent is responsible for remitting income tax payments on
    behalf of the consolidated group. The Parent’s provision
    for income taxes has been computed as if it were a separate
    tax-paying entity.

4.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Parent provides guarantees of the performance on property
    leases to its subsidiaries for properties located in various
    facilities in the United States and Mexico.

The Company provides a parental guarantee to one of its
    subsidiaries for letters of credit to certain agents. These
    letters of credit are amended quarterly. As of December 31,
    2009, $2.4 million of letters of credit were outstanding.



ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation
    of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
    Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our controls and
    procedures related to our reporting and disclosure obligations
    as of December 31, 2009, which is the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and
    Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed by us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, in the
    reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported, as applicable, within the
    time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
    and Exchange Commission, and are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
    we file or submit are accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our Principal Executive Officer and
    Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management’s report on Western Union’s internal
    control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and the related
    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, are set
    forth under Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Management’s annual report on internal control over
    financial reporting did not include an assessment of and
    conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting of Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom
    House”), which was acquired on September 1, 2009 and
    is included in our consolidated financial statements as of
    December 31, 2009 and for the period from September 1,
    2009 through December 31, 2009. The assets of Custom House,
    excluding goodwill, constituted approximately 5% of our total
    assets as of December 31, 2009, and Custom House revenues
    constituted approximately 0.6% of our total revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Under guidelines established
    by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are allowed
    to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal
    control over financial reporting during the first year following
    the acquisition while integrating the acquired company.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we completed
    the implementation of a new version of our existing Oracle
    enterprise resource planning system. This implementation was
    subject to various testing and review procedures prior to
    execution. We believe the conversion to and implementation of
    this new version further strengthened our existing internal
    control over financial reporting by enhancing certain business
    processes.

Other than the change described above, there has not been any
    change in our internal control over financial reporting during
    our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B.

    INFORMATION
