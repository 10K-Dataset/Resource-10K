ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

The Western Union Company (the “Company,”
    “Western Union,” “we,” “our” or
    “us”) is a leader in global money movement and payment
    services, providing people and businesses with fast, reliable
    and convenient ways to send money and make payments around the
    world.

The Western
    Union

®

brand is globally recognized and represents speed, reliability,
    trust and convenience. As people move and travel around the
    world, they are able to use the services of a well recognized
    brand to transfer funds. Our

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer service enables people to send money around the
    world in minutes. Our services are available through a global
    network of more than 445,000 agent locations in more than 200
    countries and territories, with approximately 85% of those
    locations outside of the United States. Each location in our
    agent network is capable of providing one or more of our
    services, with the majority offering a Western Union branded
    service. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 75% of our
    locations had experienced money transfer activity in the prior
    12 months.

Our global business payments service provides consumers and
    businesses with flexible and convenient options for making
    one-time or recurring bill payments, including

business-to-business

cross-border, cross currency payment transactions. In September
    2009, we acquired Canada-based Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom
    House”), a provider of international

business-to-business

cross-border, cross-currency payment services. In the third
    quarter of 2010, Custom House was rebranded “Western
    Union

®

Business Solutions.” Although the majority of the revenue
    in our global business payments segment was generated in the
    United States, international expansion and other key strategic
    initiatives have resulted in international revenue continuing to
    increase in this segment.

We believe that brand strength, size and reach of our global
    network, and convenience and reliability for our customers have
    been important factors relating to the growth of our business.
    As we continue to meet the needs of our customers for fast,
    reliable and convenient money transfer services, we are also
    working to enhance our services and provide our consumer and
    business clients with access to an expanding portfolio of
    payment and other financial services.

The majority of our revenue comes from fees that consumers pay
    when they send money or make payments. In certain money transfer
    and payment services transactions involving different send and
    receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference
    between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business
    and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire
    currency.

Our
    Segments

We manage our business based on the customers we serve and the
    type of services we offer. Each segment addresses a different
    combination of customer needs, distribution networks and
    services. Our segments are

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments. Our other businesses not included
    in these segments primarily consist of Western Union branded
    money order services available through a network of third-party
    agents primarily in the United States and Canada.

Form 10-K.

See Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to
    our foreign operations.

Consumer-to-Consumer

Segment

Individual money transfers from one consumer to another are the
    core of our business, representing 84% of our total consolidated
    revenues for 2010. We offer consumers a variety of ways to send
    money. Although most remittances are sent from one of our more
    than 445,000 agent locations worldwide, in some countries we
    offer the ability to send money over the internet or the
    telephone, using a credit or debit card, or through a withdrawal
    directly from a consumer’s bank account. All agent
    locations accept cash to initiate a transaction, and some also
    accept debit cards. We also offer consumers several options to
    receive a money transfer. While the vast majority of transfers
    are paid in cash at agent locations, in some places we offer
    payout directly to the receiver’s bank account, to a
    stored-value card, to a mobile phone or through the issuance of
    a money order.

Operations

Our revenue is derived primarily from transaction fees charged
    to consumers to transfer money. In money transfers involving
    different send and receive currencies, we also generate revenue
    based on the difference between the exchange rate set by Western
    Union to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are
    able to acquire currency.

In a typical money transfer transaction, a consumer goes to one
    of our agent locations, completes a form specifying, among other
    things, the name and address of the recipient, and delivers it,
    along with the principal amount of the money transfer and the
    fee, to the agent. This sending agent enters the transaction
    information into our money transfer system and the funds are
    made available for payment, usually within minutes. The
    recipient enters an agent location in the designated receiving
    area or country, presents identification and is paid the
    transferred amount. Recipients do not pay a fee (although in
    limited circumstances, a tax may be imposed by the local
    government on the receipt of the money transfer). We determine
    the fee paid by the sender, which generally is based on the
    principal amount of the transaction and the send and receive
    locations.

We generally pay our agents a commission based on a percentage
    of revenue. The commission is shared between the agent that
    initiated the transaction, the “send agent,” and the
    agent that paid the transaction, the “receive agent.”
    For most agents, the costs of providing the physical
    infrastructure and staff are typically covered by the
    agent’s primary business (e.g., postal services, banking,
    check cashing, travel and retail businesses), making the
    economics of being a Western Union agent attractive. Western
    Union’s global reach and large consumer base allow us to
    attract agents we believe to be of high quality.

To complement the convenience offered by our network’s
    global physical locations, in certain countries we have also
    made our services available through other channels, as described
    below under “Services.”



Over 85% of our

consumer-to-consumer

transactions involve at least one

non-United

States location. No individual country outside the United States
    accounted for more than approximately 6%, 6% and 7% of our
    consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Certain of our agents facilitate a
    large number of transactions; however, all individual agents
    accounted for less than 10% of the segment’s revenue during
    these periods.

Services

We offer money transfer services worldwide. In 2010, over 95% of
    our

consumer-to-consumer

transactions were cash money transfers involving our walk-in
    agent locations around the world. Although demand for in-person,
    cash money transfers has historically been the strongest, we
    offer a number of options for sending and receiving funds that
    provide consumer convenience and choice to meet the needs of
    consumers. The different ways consumers can send or receive
    money include the following:

Walk-in money transfer service.

The substantial
    majority of our remittances constitute transactions in which
    cash is collected by the agent and payment (usually cash) is
    available for

pick-up

at
    another agent location in the designated receive location,
    usually within minutes. In the United States, including some
    United States outbound corridors, Canada and in other select
    international corridors, we provide a “Direct to Bank”
    service, enabling a consumer to send a transaction from an agent
    location directly to a bank account. We also provide a
    “Cash to Card” service that provides consumers an
    option to direct funds to a Western Union branded stored-value
    card in the United States, with the option to have the card
    delivered overnight to consumers’ homes. To facilitate
    offering our services at retail locations that do not have
    dedicated service staff, we are in the early stages of the
    roll-out of
    “goCASH

sm

”

    in the United States, a money transfer service that lets
    consumers purchase money transfers at pre-set amounts

in-lane,

at
    a cash register, and then complete the transfer over the phone
    through a Western Union customer service representative or
    through a website.

Our “Next Day” delivery option is a money transfer
    that is available for payment the morning after the money
    transfer is sent. This option is available in certain markets
    for domestic service within the United States, and in select
    United States outbound and international corridors. The Next Day
    delivery service gives our consumers a lower-priced option for
    money transfers that do not need to be received within minutes,
    while still offering the convenience, reliability and

ease-of-use

that our consumers expect.

Online money transfer service.

Our websites allow
    consumers to send funds on-line, generally using a credit or
    debit card, for pay-out at most Western Union branded agent
    locations around the world. As of December 31, 2010, we are
    now providing on-line money transfer service in 20 countries,
    allowing consumers in these countries to send money throughout
    the world.

Telephone money transfer service.

Our Telephone
    Money Transfer service allows Western Union consumers to send
    funds by telephone without visiting an agent location. Consumers
    call a toll-free number in the United States, Canada, Ireland or
    the United Kingdom and use a debit card or credit card to
    initiate a transaction. The money transfer is then available for
    pay-out at a Western Union agent location.

Account based money transfer service.

This service
    allows consumers to access Western Union services
    electronically, directly from their bank’s internet, or ATM
    banking service. They can use their bank account to either
    initiate, or in some cases, receive a Western Union money
    transfer electronically, without having to visit a physical
    Western Union agent location. We have relationships with 40
    banks that have agreed to offer this service, primarily through
    their online banking portals.

Mobile money transfer service.

Our mobile money
    transfer service provides consumers in a number of select
    countries with the ability to transfer money to a mobile wallet
    or bank account. Consumers in selected countries can also
    initiate transactions from their mobile phones and send money
    from mobile wallets or bank accounts. As of December 31,
    2010, there were over 80,000 Western Union agent locations
    enabled with the technology to transfer money to a mobile phone.



Distribution
    and Marketing Channels

We offer our

consumer-to-consumer

service to millions of consumers around the world primarily
    through our global network of third-party agents in almost every
    country and territory, with approximately 85% of our agent
    locations being located outside of the United States. Our agents
    facilitate the global distribution and convenience associated
    with our Western Union and other brands, which in-turn helps
    create demand for our services and helps us to recruit and
    retain agents. Western Union agents include large networks such
    as post offices, banks and retailers and other established
    organizations that provide other consumer products and services.
    Many of our agents have multiple locations. Our agents know the
    markets they serve and work with our management to develop
    business plans for their markets. Many of our agents contribute
    financial resources, or otherwise support, our efforts to market
    the business. Many agents operate in locations that are open
    outside of traditional banking hours, for example on nights and
    weekends. Our top 40 agents globally have been with us an
    average of approximately 14 years, and in 2010, these
    long-standing agents were involved in transactions that
    generated more than 60% of our

consumer-to-consumer

revenue.

We provide our third-party agents with our multi-currency,
    real-time money transfer processing systems used to originate
    and pay money transfers. Over the last several years, we have
    emphasized the development of our receive network around the
    world to optimize send and receive corridors. Our systems and
    processes enable our agents to pay money transfers in more than
    120 currencies worldwide. Many of our agents can pay in multiple
    currencies at a single location. Our agents provide the physical
    infrastructure and staff required to complete the transfers.
    Western Union provides central operating functions such as
    transaction processing, settlement, marketing support and
    customer relationship management to our agents.

Some of our agents outside the United States manage subagents.
    We refer to these agents as superagents. Although our subagents
    are under contract with these superagents (and not with Western
    Union directly), the subagent locations typically have access to
    the same technology and services as our other agent locations.

Our international agents often customize services as appropriate
    for their geographic markets. In some markets, individual agents
    are independently offering specific services such as
    stored-value card payout options and Direct to Bank service. Our
    marketing benefits from feedback from our agents and consumers,
    and in many of our markets, our agents fund marketing activities.

Our marketing strategy includes our global loyalty card program,
    which is available in a growing number of countries and
    territories. As of December 31, 2010, the loyalty card
    program was available in 80 countries and territories and had
    almost 16 million active cards, an increase in the number
    of active cards of 18% from December 31, 2009. The card
    offers consumers faster service at the

point-of-sale

and, in certain countries, reduced service fees or cash back to
    consumers. Loyalty card consumers generally initiate more
    transactions and have a higher rate of retention than non-carded
    consumers. Over one-third of Western Union branded

consumer-to-consumer

transactions are initiated using a loyalty card. The global
    loyalty card program is one component of our consumer
    relationship management strategy designed to support and enhance
    long-term relationships with our consumers. Consumer databases
    supplement these efforts by providing insight on consumer
    preferences so that we can selectively target consumer
    communications and marketing.

Industry
    Trends

Over the last several years, except for 2009, the cross-border
    money transfer industry has experienced growth. Trends in the
    cross-border money transfer business tend to correlate to
    migration trends, global economic opportunity and related
    employment rates worldwide. The top four inbound remittance
    countries in the world are India, China, Mexico and the
    Philippines, and cumulatively receive an estimated
    $150 billion annually according to The World Bank’s
    November 2010 report. Due to the weak global economy, including
    declines in consumer confidence and high unemployment, the
    demand for money transfers has softened. The World Bank projects
    cross-border remittance growth of approximately 5% in 2011. We
    anticipate that the remittance market will continue to recover
    as the global economy improves.

Another significant trend impacting the money transfer industry
    is the increase in regulation. Regulation in the United States
    and elsewhere focuses, in part, on anti-money laundering,
    anti-terrorist activities and consumer



protection. Regulations require money transfer providers, banks
    and other financial institutions to develop systems to detect,
    monitor and report certain transactions.

Competition

We face robust competition in the highly-fragmented

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer industry. We compete with a variety of money
    transfer service providers, including:

•

Global money transfer providers

—Global money
    transfer providers allow consumers to send money to a wide
    variety of locations, in both their home countries and abroad.

•

Regional money transfer providers

—Regional money
    transfer providers, or “niche” players, provide the
    same services as global money transfer providers, but focus on a
    small group of corridors or services within one region, such as
    North America to the Caribbean, Central or South America, or
    Western Europe to North Africa.

•

Banks and postbanks

—Banks and postbanks of all sizes
    compete with us in a number of ways, including bank wire
    services and card-based services. We believe that banks and
    postbanks offer consumers wire transfer services and other money
    transfer methods as an incentive to those consumers to purchase
    other services and products.

•

Informal networks

—Informal networks enable people to
    transfer funds without formal mechanisms and often without
    compliance with government reporting requirements. We believe
    that such networks comprise a significant share of the market.

•

Electronic commerce

—Online money transfer services
    allow consumers to send and receive money electronically using
    the internet.

•

Alternative channels

—Alternative channels for
    sending and receiving money include mail and commercial courier
    services, money transfers using mobile phones, and card-based
    options, such as ATM cards and stored-value cards.

We believe the most significant competitive factors in

consumer-to-consumer

remittances relate to brand recognition, trust and reliability,
    distribution network and channel options, consumer experience
    and price.

Global
    Business Payments Segment

In our global business payments segment, we provide fast and
    convenient options to make one-time or recurring payments for
    consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business
    payments services allow consumers to make payments to a variety
    of organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies,
    mortgage servicers, financial service providers, governmental
    agencies and other businesses. We also provide international

business-to-business

cross-border, cross-currency payment services. We can process
    payments using the customer’s credit card, debit card, bank
    account or cash depending on the service selected. We believe
    our business customers who receive payments through our services
    benefit from their relationship with Western Union as it
    provides them with real-time or near real-time posting of their
    customer payments. In certain circumstances, our relationships
    with business customers also provide them with an additional
    source of income, as well as reduced expenses for cash and check
    handling.

Operations

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from
    transaction fees paid by the customer. These fees are typically
    less than the fees charged in our

consumer-to-consumer

segment. Consumers may make a cash payment at an agent or owned
    location and businesses may remit a check, electronic or wire
    transfer in order to initiate a transaction. In order to make an
    electronic payment, consumers or businesses initiate a
    transaction over the telephone or the internet which we process
    through credit card, debit card, automated clearing house
    (“ACH”) or wire transfer, depending on the service
    selected. Our internet services are provided through our own
    websites or, in certain circumstances, in partnership with other
    websites for which we act as the service provider. In
    cross-border transactions involving different currencies, we
    primarily generate revenue based on the difference between the



exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business and the rate
    at which we are able to acquire currency. In addition, we
    generate revenue from upfront enrollment fees received for our
    Equity
    Accelerator

®

service, and we earn investment income on funds received from
    services sold in advance of settlement with payment recipients.

While we continue to pursue further international expansion of
    our offerings in this segment, the majority of the
    segment’s revenue was generated in the United States during
    all periods presented. However, international expansion and
    other key strategic initiatives have resulted in international
    revenue continuing to increase in this segment.

Services

Our global business payments services are available through a
    variety of products which give customers choices as to the
    payment channel and method of payment, and include the following:

Western Union Business Solutions.

Western Union
    Business Solutions (“Business Solutions”) offers
    international cross-border, cross-currency

business-to-business

payment solutions. These payment transactions are conducted
    through various channels including the telephone and internet.
    Business Solutions operates its own website to offer services
    and also serves as the ultimate service provider for other
    partner websites. Payments are made predominately through wire
    transfers and ACH, but in some situations, checks are remitted.
    The majority of Business Solutions’ business relates to
    exchanges of currency at the spot rate which enables customers
    to make cross-currency payments. In addition, we write foreign
    currency forward and option contracts for customers to
    facilitate future payments.

Western Union Payments.

The Western Union Payments
    service, formerly Quick
    Collect

®

,

    allows consumers to send funds to businesses and government
    agencies across the United States and Canada, using cash and, in
    certain locations, a debit card. This service is offered
    primarily at Western Union agent locations, but may be provided
    via our westernunion.com website in limited situations. This
    service is also offered in select international locations under
    the service mark Quick
    Pay

sm

.

    We also offer Quick
    Cash

®

,

    a cash disbursement service used by businesses and government
    agencies to send money to employees or individuals with whom
    they have accounts or other business relationships. Similar to
    our Western Union Payments service, consumers use our Western
    Union Convenience
    Pay

®

(“Convenience Pay”) service to send payments by cash
    or check from a smaller number of Convenience Pay agent
    locations primarily to utilities and telecommunication
    providers. We are in the process of consolidating all of these
    services to be marketed as Western Union Payments.

Pago
    Fácil

®

. In

    South America, we offer walk-in, cash bill payment services
    which allow consumers to make payments for services such as
    phone, utilities and other recurring bills. In Argentina, we
    provide this service under the Pago Fácil brand. We offer
    this service under the Western Union brand in Peru and Panama.

Speedpay

®

. Our

    Speedpay service is offered principally in the United States and
    allows consumers to make payments to a variety of businesses
    using credit cards, debit cards, ACH and in limited situations,
    checks. Payments are initiated over the telephone or the
    internet. We also partner with some businesses to allow their
    customers to access Speedpay from their websites.

Equity Accelerator.

Our Equity Accelerator service
    enables consumers to make mortgage payments by ACH. It is
    marketed as a convenient way for homeowners to schedule
    additional recurring principal payments on their mortgages.
    Consumers who enroll in this service make mortgage payments
    based on an accelerated program, which results in a more rapid
    reduction of their mortgage balance, as well as interest
    savings. We also offer a non-recurring mortgage payment service
    under the brand Just in Time
    EFT

®

.

Distribution
    and Marketing Channels

Our electronic consumer payment services are available primarily
    through the telephone and the internet, while our cash-based
    consumer services are available through our agent networks and
    select Company owned locations. Our business payment services
    are offered through owned locations, telephone, via the internet
    and partner channels.

Businesses market our services to consumers in a number of ways,
    and we market our services directly to consumers and businesses
    using a variety of means, including advertising materials,
    promotional activities, call



campaigns and attendance at trade shows and seminars. Our
    internet services are marketed to consumers and businesses on
    our websites as well as through co-branding arrangements with
    our website partners who offer our payment solutions.

We have relationships with more than 6,400 businesses to which
    our customers can make payments, approximately 2,500 of which
    primarily relate to our bill payment business in Argentina, Pago
    Fácil. These relationships are a core component of our
    global business payments services. On average, we have provided
    our payment services to our top 20 businesses to which our
    consumers can make payments for more than 14 years. No
    individual customer or business accounted for greater than 10%
    of this segment’s revenue during all periods presented.

Industry
    Trends

The global business payments industry has evolved with
    technological innovations that have created new methods of
    processing payments from individuals or businesses to other
    businesses. The various products within the global business
    payments industry are in varying stages of development outside
    the United States. The cross-border payments industry is
    expected to expand considerably in the future due to the
    expanding global focus of many businesses. We believe that the
    United States is in the midst of a trend away from cash and
    paper checks toward electronic payment methods accessible
    through multiple technologies. Furthermore, due to the weak
    economic situation in the United States, we believe many United
    States consumers who would use our services are having
    difficulty paying their bills and are unable to obtain credit in
    any form, resulting in our handling fewer bill payments.

Competition

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers
    offering both cash and electronic-based payment solutions and

business-to-business

payment services. Competition in electronic payments and

business-to-business

payment services include financial institutions (which may offer
    consumer bill payment or business payment services in their own
    name or may “host” payment services operated under the
    names of their clients). Competition for electronic payments
    also includes businesses offering their own or third-party
    services to their own customers and third-party providers of all
    sizes offering services directly to consumers. In many cases,
    competitors specialize in a small number of industries.
    Competitors for cash payments include businesses that allow
    consumers to pay a bill at one of their locations, or at the
    location of a partner business, as well as mail and courier
    services. The ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments
    in the United States and competitive pressures, which result in
    lower volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction
    products, are impacting this business.

We believe the most significant competitive factors in this
    segment relate to brand recognition, customer service, trust and
    reliability, convenience, speed, variety of payment methods,
    service offerings and price.

For additional details regarding our global business payments
    segment, see Item 7 of Part II and our historical
    financial statements and the notes to those statements included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Other

Our remaining businesses are grouped in the “Other”
    category, which primarily includes our money order and prepaid
    services.

Customers use our money orders for making purchases, paying
    bills, and as an alternative to checks that can be deposited
    directly into bank accounts or cashed at check cashiers, some
    banks and some retailers. We derive investment income from
    interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which
    are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and
    municipal debt securities.

Our prepaid cards are sold primarily in the United States
    through retail locations and on the Internet. This service
    allows consumers to load money or receive a direct deposit from
    their employer onto the card for use at a later date. The card
    can be used to withdraw money from an ATM or used where debit
    cards are accepted. We have agreements with FDIC-insured
    depository institutions that serve as the issuers of our cards
    in the United States. We plan to leverage our brand,
    distribution, consumer relationships, and infrastructure to
    develop prepaid in international markets.



Intellectual
    Property

The Western Union brand, consisting of trademark registrations
    in many countries, is material to our Company. The international
    expansion of our agent network over the past decade has taken
    the Western Union brand nearly everywhere consumers send and
    receive money. The loss of the Western Union trademark or a
    diminution in the perceived quality associated with the name
    would harm our growth. We offer money transfer services under
    the Western Union, Orlandi

tm

,

    that are also important to our Company.

Our operating results over the past several years have allowed
    us to invest significantly each year to support our brands. In
    2010, we invested approximately $210 million to market,
    advertise and promote our brands and services. Many of our
    agents have also contributed significant financial resources to
    assist with marketing our services.

We own patents and patent applications covering various aspects
    of our processes and services. We have been, are and in the
    future may be, subject to claims and suits alleging that our
    technology or business methods infringe patents owned by others,
    both in and out of the United States. Unfavorable resolution of
    these claims could require us to change how we deliver services,
    result in significant financial consequences, or both, which
    could adversely affect our business, financial position and
    results of operations.

Risk
    Management

Our Company has a credit risk management department that
    evaluates and monitors our agent-related credit and fraud risks.
    We are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances
    from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment and
    money order settlement process. We also are exposed to credit
    risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through
    our online services and electronic global business payment
    channels, where transactions are originated through means other
    than cash, and may therefore be subject to
    “chargebacks,” insufficient funds or other collection
    impediments, such as fraud. Our credit risk management team
    performs a credit review before each agent signing and conducts
    periodic analyses. As a result, our losses associated with bad
    debts have been less than 1% of our annual revenue in each of
    the last three fiscal years. However, the challenging global
    economic environment may increase our losses associated with bad
    debts.

Our Business Solutions business exposes us to credit risk
    relating to derivative financial instruments written by us to
    our customers. The duration of these derivative contracts is
    generally nine months or less. The credit risk associated with
    our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency
    exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting
    their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to
    us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. To mitigate
    this risk, we perform periodic credit reviews of customers on an
    ongoing basis. In addition, we may require certain customers to
    post collateral based on the fair value of the customer’s
    contract and their risk profile. As we require the receipt of
    funds from our customers, in most cases, before releasing the
    associated cross-currency payment, the credit risk arising from
    our spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely
    mitigated.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to
    investment securities, money market fund investments and other
    credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with
    banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment
    concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit
    ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among
    global financial institutions.

A key component of the Western Union business model is our
    ability to manage financial risk associated with conducting
    transactions worldwide. We settle accounts with the majority of
    our agents in United States dollars or euros. We utilize foreign
    currency exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts, to
    mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations and to
    provide predictability of future cash flows. Limited foreign
    currency risk arises with respect to the agent settlement
    process. The foreign currency exchange risk is limited because
    the majority of money transfer transactions are paid within
    24 hours after they are initiated and agent settlements
    occur within a few days in most instances.



Our financial results may fluctuate due to changes in interest
    rates. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed
    rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each,
    while also considering the duration of the individual positions.
    We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an
    attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and optimize returns. Our
    exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix
    of our interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of
    fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished
    primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the terms
    of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use
    interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the
    percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions.

International
    Investment

We have accumulated approximately $2.5 billion of foreign
    earnings at December 31, 2010, for which no provision has
    been made for United States federal and state income taxes, as
    we have reinvested or expect to reinvest these earnings outside
    the United States indefinitely. We intend to invest these
    earnings to expand and diversify our global distribution and
    explore new service offerings. In 2009, we used our foreign
    earnings to acquire the money transfer business of our largest
    European-based agent, FEXCO, and also to acquire Custom House,
    which expanded the service offerings of the global business
    payments segment to include cross-currency, cross-border
    business to business payments. We continue to look for
    opportunities for international acquisitions and investments in
    joint ventures that will complement our existing businesses
    worldwide, such as our recent agreement to acquire the remaining
    70% interest which we currently do not own in Angelo Costa
    S.r.l. (“Costa”), one of our largest money transfer
    agents in Europe, which is expected to close in the first half
    of 2011. We may also invest in expanding our current service
    offerings or our international operating sites to drive organic
    growth. However, if we are unable to utilize these earnings
    outside of the United States and we repatriate these earnings to
    the United States in the form of actual or constructive
    dividends, we would be subject to United States federal income
    taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state
    income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various
    foreign countries.

Regulation

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations
    enacted by the United States federal government, each of the
    states, many localities and many other countries and
    jurisdictions, such as the European Union. These include
    financial services regulations, consumer disclosure and consumer
    protection laws, currency control regulations, money transfer
    and payment instrument licensing regulations, payment service
    laws, rules, laws and regulations including those governing
    credit cards, electronic payments, foreign exchange hedging
    services and the sale of spot and forward currency contracts,
    escheat laws, competition laws and laws covering consumer
    privacy, data protection and information security. Our services
    also are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and
    regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent
    money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit
    activity. Failure to comply with any of these
    requirements—by either Western Union or its agents or their
    subagents (who are third parties, over whom Western Union has
    limited legal and practical control)—could result in the
    suspension or revocation of a license or registration required
    to provide money transfer services

and/or

payment services or foreign exchange products, the limitation,
    suspension or termination of services, the seizure of our
    assets,

and/or

the
    imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines and
    restrictions on our ability to offer services.

We have developed and continue to enhance our global compliance
    programs, including our anti-money laundering program,
    comprising policies, procedures, systems and internal controls
    to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory
    requirements. In addition, we continue to adapt our business
    practices and strategies to help us comply with current and
    evolving legal standards and industry practices. These programs
    include dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring
    programs, suspicious activity reporting, regulatory outreach and
    education, and support and guidance to our agent network on
    regulatory compliance. Our money transfer network operates
    through third-party agents in most countries, and, therefore,
    our legal and practical ability to control those agents’
    compliance activities is limited.



Dodd-Frank
    Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
    (the “Financial Reform Act” or “Act”) became
    United States federal law in 2010. The Financial Reform Act
    creates a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the
    “Consumer Protection Bureau”) whose purpose will be to
    issue and enforce consumer protection initiatives governing
    financial products and services, including money transfer
    services in the United States, which will require us to provide
    enhanced disclosures to our money transfer customers. Depending
    upon the final rules to be issued by the Consumer Protection
    Bureau, we may need to modify our systems to provide these
    additional disclosures or we may be liable for the failure of
    our money transfer agents to comply with the Act, the extent of
    which liability will be determined by rules not yet enacted. In
    addition, rules adopted under the Act by other governmental
    agencies may subject our corporate interest rate and foreign
    exchange hedging transactions to centralized clearing and
    collateral posting requirements. Also, our Business Solutions
    business in the United States may be subjected to increased
    regulatory oversight and licensing requirements relating to the
    foreign exchange derivative products offered to certain of its
    customers.

Money
    Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing and
    Regulation

In the United States, most states license money transfer
    services providers. Many states exercise authority over the
    operations of our money transfer services and, as part of this
    authority, regularly examine us. Many states require us to
    invest the proceeds of money transfers in high-quality,
    investment grade securities, and our use of such investments is
    restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations. We
    regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our
    exposure by making high-quality investments in compliance with
    these regulations. The majority of our investment securities,
    classified within “settlement assets” in the
    consolidated balance sheets, most of which relate to state
    licensing requirements in the United States, had credit ratings
    of “AA-” or better from a major credit rating agency
    as of December 31, 2010.

These licensing laws also cover matters such as government
    approval of controlling shareholders and senior management of
    our licensed entities, regulatory approval of agent locations,
    consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the
    licensee, and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain
    certain net worth levels. Many states also require money
    transmitters and their agents to comply with federal

and/or

state
    anti-money laundering laws and regulations.

Our money transfer and money order services are subject to
    anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank
    Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
    (collectively, the “BSA”) and similar state laws and
    regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money
    transfer companies and the issuers and sellers of money orders,
    to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering
    programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious
    activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information
    about consumers who use their services and maintain other
    transaction records. Many states impose similar and, in some
    cases, more stringent requirements. These requirements also
    apply to our agents. In addition, the United States Department
    of the Treasury has interpreted the BSA to require money
    transfer companies to conduct due diligence into and risk-based
    monitoring of their agents inside and outside the United States.

Economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the United
    States Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets
    Control (“OFAC”) prohibit or restrict transactions to
    or from (or dealings with) certain countries, their governments,
    and in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with
    specifically-designated individuals and entities such as
    narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations.
    We provide very limited

consumer-to-consumer

services to individuals in Cuba, Syria and Sudan pursuant to and
    as authorized by advisory opinions of, or licenses granted by,
    OFAC.

Outside of the United States, our money transfer business is
    subject to some form of regulation in all of the countries and
    territories in which we offer those services. These laws and
    regulations may include limitations on what types of entities
    may offer money transfer services, limitations on the amount of
    principal that can be sent into or out of a country, limitations
    on the number of money transfers that may be sent or received by
    a consumer and controls on the rates of exchange between
    currencies. They may also include laws and regulations intended
    to help detect and prevent money laundering or terrorist
    financing, including reporting requirements similar to those



required under the BSA described earlier. In most countries,
    either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or
    permits to offer money transfer services.

The Payment Services Directive (“PSD”), which became
    effective on November 1, 2009, has changed the payments
    market in the European Union (“EU”), harmonizing the
    licensing and certain other requirements for offering payment
    services within the EU. Previously, those requirements differed
    significantly among these countries. The PSD also imposed new
    rules on payment service providers like Western Union. In
    particular, the PSD makes us responsible for the regulatory
    compliance of our agents and their subagents in the EU who are
    engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries which
    are regulated by Ireland and the United Kingdom. The majority of
    our EU business will be managed through our PSD subsidiaries by
    April 2011. Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory action against
    us because of the actions of our EU agents and their subagents
    has increased. Under the PSD, we are subject to investment
    safeguarding rules and periodic examinations similar to those we
    are subject to in the United States. These rules have resulted
    in increased compliance costs and may lead to increased
    competition in our areas of service.

We have developed and continue to enhance global compliance
    programs to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory
    requirements. Our money transfer network operates through
    third-party agents in most countries, and our legal and
    practical ability to control those agents’ compliance
    activities is limited. To assist in managing and monitoring
    money laundering and terrorist financing risks, we have
    developed and continue to enhance our global compliance
    programs, including an anti-money laundering compliance program
    comprising policies, procedures, systems and internal controls.
    We have employees in a number of our offices around the world
    dedicated to our global compliance program efforts. In
    connection with an agreement and settlement with the State of
    Arizona and other states entered into in February 2010, we have
    funded $71 million to a

not-for-profit

organization to promote safety and security along the entire
    United States and Mexico border and to the State of Arizona for
    its costs associated with this matter. This agreement and
    settlement also resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims
    with the State. In addition, as part of the agreement and
    settlement, we have made and expect to make certain investments
    in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico
    border and we have engaged a monitor of those programs. The
    costs of the investments and the monitor are expected to reach
    up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013. See
    also Item 1A, Risk Factors—“

Western Union has
    been the subject of

class-action

litigation, and remains the subject of other litigation as well
    as consent agreements with or enforcement actions by
    regulators

” for more information on this agreement and
    settlement.

Government agencies both inside and outside the United States
    may impose new or additional rules on money transfers affecting
    us or our agents, including regulations that:

•

prohibit transactions in, to or from certain countries,
    governments and individuals and entities;

•

impose additional identification, reporting or recordkeeping
    requirements;

•

limit the types of entities capable of providing money transfer
    services or impose additional licensing or registration
    requirements;

•

impose minimum capital or other financial requirements on us or
    our agents and their subagents;

•

limit or restrict the revenue which may be generated from money
    transfers, including transaction fees and revenue derived from
    foreign exchange;

•

require enhanced disclosures to our money transfer customers;

•

require the principal amount of money transfers originated in a
    country to be invested in that country or held in trust until
    they are paid; or

•

limit the number or principal amount of money transfers which
    may be sent to or from the jurisdiction, whether by an
    individual, through one agent or in aggregate.

Escheat
    Regulations

Our Company is subject to unclaimed or abandoned property
    (escheat) laws in the United States and abroad. These laws
    require us to turn over to certain government authorities the
    property of others held by our Company that



has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as
    unpaid money transfers. We hold property subject to escheat laws
    and we have an ongoing program to comply with the laws. We are
    subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices.

Privacy
    and Information Security Regulations

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of
    personal information is required to provide our services. These
    activities are subject to information security standards, data
    privacy, data breach and related laws and regulations in the
    United States and other countries. In the United States, data
    privacy and data breach laws such as the federal
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws apply directly to
    a broad range of financial institutions including money
    transmitters like Western Union, and indirectly to companies
    that provide services to those institutions. Many state laws
    require us to provide notification to affected individuals,
    state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a
    security breach of computer databases or physical documents that
    contain certain types of non-public personal information and
    present a risk for unauthorized use.

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of
    personal information required to provide our services is subject
    to data privacy laws outside of the United States, such as laws
    adopted pursuant to the EU’s 95/46 EC Directive of the
    European Parliament (the “Data Protection Directive”),
    Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic
    Documents Act, individual European national laws and data
    privacy laws of other provinces or countries. In some cases, the
    laws of a country may be more restrictive than the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the laws developed to comply with
    the Data Protection Directive may impose additional duties on
    companies. Each of these laws may restrict the collection,
    transfer, processing, storage, use and disclosure of sensitive
    personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy
    practices and may give individuals certain rights to prevent the
    use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes
    such as marketing.

These regulations, laws and industry standards also impose
    requirements for safeguarding personal information through the
    issuance of internal data security standards, controls or
    guidelines.

In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the
    prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and
    pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, Western Union
    makes information available to certain United States federal and
    state, as well as certain foreign government agencies when
    required by law. In recent years, these agencies have increased
    their requests for such information from Western Union and other
    companies (both financial service providers and others),
    particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist
    financing or identity theft. During the same period, there has
    also been increased public attention regarding the corporate use
    and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by
    legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data
    protection, information security and consumer privacy. These
    regulatory goals—the prevention of money laundering,
    terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the
    individual’s right to privacy—may conflict, and the
    law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we
    believe that Western Union is compliant with its regulatory
    responsibilities, the legal, political and business environments
    in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation,
    regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could
    expose Western Union to increased program costs, liability and
    reputational damage.

Banking
    Regulation

We have subsidiaries that operate under banking licenses granted
    by the Austrian Financial Market Authority and the Brazilian
    Central Bank which subject these subsidiaries to Austrian and
    Brazilian regulations. We are also subject to regulation,
    examination and supervision by the New York State Banking
    Department (the “Banking Department”), which has
    regulatory authority over our entity that holds all interest in
    these subsidiaries, a limited liability investment company
    organized under Article XII of the New York Banking Law. An
    Agreement of Supervision with the Banking Department imposes
    various regulatory requirements including operational
    limitations, capital requirements, affiliate transaction
    limitations, and notice and reporting requirements. Banking
    Department approval is required under the New York Banking Law
    and the Agreement of Supervision prior to any change in control
    of the Article XII investment company.

Since these subsidiaries do not operate any banking offices in
    the United States and do not conduct business in the United
    States except as may be incidental to their activities outside
    the United States, our Company’s affiliation



with these subsidiaries does not cause them to be subject to the
    provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act in the United States.

Other

Some of our services are subject to card association rules and
    regulations. For example, an independent standards-setting
    organization, the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”)
    Security Standards Council (including American Express, Discover
    Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and
    Visa Inc. International) developed a set of comprehensive
    requirements concerning payment card account security through
    the transaction process, called the Payment Card Industry Data
    Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). All merchants and
    service providers that store, process and transmit payment card
    data are required to comply with PCI DSS as a condition to
    accepting credit cards. We are subject to annual reviews to
    ensure compliance with PCI regulations worldwide and are subject
    to fines if we are found to be non-compliant.

Stored-value services offered by Western Union prepaid services
    are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to
    consumer protection, licensing, escheat and money laundering.
    These laws are evolving, unclear and sometimes inconsistent, and
    the extent to which these laws apply to Western Union or its
    consumers is in a state of change. We are unable to determine
    the impact that the clarification of these laws and their future
    interpretations may have on these services.

Employees
    and Labor

As of January 31, 2011, our businesses employed
    approximately 7,000 employees, of which
    5,000 employees are located outside of the United States.
    Our United States based employees are not represented by any
    unions or collective bargaining agreements.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business, financial
    position and results of operations, some of which are beyond our
    control. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risks
    described below. You should carefully consider all of these
    risks.

Risks
    Relating to Our Business and Industry

Interruptions
    in migration patterns, including as a result of economic
    conditions, could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our money transfer business relies in large part on migration,
    which brings workers to countries with greater economic
    opportunities than those available in their native countries. A
    significant portion of money transfers are sent by international
    migrants. Migration is affected by (among other factors) overall
    economic conditions, the availability of job opportunities,
    changes in immigration laws, and political or other events (such
    as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that would make it more
    difficult for workers to migrate or work abroad. Changes to
    these factors could adversely affect our remittance volume and
    could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

Many of our consumers work in industries that may be impacted by
    deteriorating economic conditions more quickly or significantly
    than other industries. Reduced job opportunities, especially in
    construction, manufacturing, hospitality, agriculture and
    retail, or overall weakness in the world’s economies could
    adversely affect the number of money transfer transactions, the
    principal amounts transferred and correspondingly our results of
    operations. If general market softness in the economies of
    countries important to migrant workers continues, our results of
    operations could be adversely impacted. Additionally, if our
    consumer transactions decline, if the amount of money that
    consumers send per transaction declines, or if migration
    patterns shift due to weak or deteriorating economic conditions,
    our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Our
    ability to adapt technology in response to changing industry and
    consumer needs or trends poses a challenge to our
    business.

Our ability to compete in the markets we serve may be threatened
    by change, including changes in technology, changes with respect
    to consumer needs, competition and industry standards. We
    actively seek solutions that respond in a timely manner to new
    technology-based money transfer services such as internet,
    phone-based money transfer services and prepaid, stored-value
    and other card-based money transfer services. Failure to respond
    well to these challenges could adversely impact our business,
    financial position and results of operations. Further, even if
    the Company responds well to these challenges, the business and
    financial models offered by many of these alternatives, more
    technology-reliant means of money transfer may be materially
    less advantageous to us than the model offered by our
    traditional cash/agent model.

Our
    business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations.
    Failure by us, our agents or subagents to comply with those laws
    and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business,
    financial position and results of operations.

As described under Item 1 of Part I, our business is
    subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. These include
    financial services regulations, consumer disclosure and consumer
    protection laws, currency control regulations, money transfer
    and payment instrument licensing regulations, escheat laws,
    competition laws and laws covering consumer privacy, data
    protection and information security. New and proposed
    legislation relating to financial services providers and
    consumer protection in various jurisdictions around the world
    may also affect the manner in which we provide our services.

Our services also are subject to an increasingly strict set of
    legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and
    prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit
    activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges,
    regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often
    quickly and with little notice. Economic and trade sanctions
    programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury
    Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibit or
    restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified
    countries, their



governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and
    with individuals and entities that are specially-designated
    nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and
    terrorists or terrorist organizations. As U.S. federal and
    state as well as foreign legislative and regulatory scrutiny and
    enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect that our
    costs of complying with these requirements will increase,
    perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these
    requirements—by us or by our agents and their subagents
    (who are third parties over whom we have limited legal and
    practical control) could result in the suspension or revocation
    of a license or registration required to provide money transfer
    services, the limitation, suspension or termination of services,
    the seizure

and/or

forfeiture of our assets

and/or

the
    imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. In
    addition to those direct costs, a failure by us or by our agents
    and their subagents to comply with applicable laws and
    regulations also could seriously damage our reputation and
    brands, and result in diminished revenue and profit and
    increased operating costs.

In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the
    prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and
    pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, we make
    information available to certain United States federal and
    state, as well as certain foreign government agencies when
    required by law. In recent years, these agencies have increased
    their requests for such information from us and other companies
    (both financial service providers and others), particularly in
    connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing. During
    the same period, there has also been increased public attention
    regarding the corporate use and disclosure of personal
    information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended
    to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer
    privacy. These regulatory goals—the prevention of money
    laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the
    protection of the individual’s right to privacy—may
    conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or
    settled. While we believe that we are compliant with our
    regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and business
    environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent
    legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other
    events could expose us to increased program costs, liability and
    reputational damage.

Changes in the regulatory environment may also impact the manner
    in which we may operate our business or may change the
    competitive landscape. Recently proposed and enacted legislation
    related to financial services providers and consumer protection
    in various jurisdictions around the world and at the federal and
    state level in the United States may subject us to additional
    regulatory oversight, mandate additional consumer disclosures,
    mandate additional taxes or fees to be imposed upon consumers,
    or otherwise impact the manner in which we provide our services.

For example, our business may be adversely impacted by the
    Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
    “Financial Reform Act” or “Act”) which
    became law in the United States on July 21, 2010. At this
    time, we are unable to predict the impact on our business
    because many of the provisions of the Act that could affect us
    require the adoption of rules or mandate studies, which could
    result in additional legislative or regulatory requirements. The
    Financial Reform Act creates a new Bureau of Consumer Financial
    Protection (the “Consumer Protection Bureau”) whose
    purpose will be to issue and enforce consumer protection
    initiatives governing financial products and services, including
    money transfer services, which will require us to provide
    enhanced disclosures to our money transfer customers. Depending
    upon the final rules to be issued by the Consumer Protection
    Bureau, we may need to modify our systems to provide these
    additional disclosures or we may be liable for the failure of
    our money transfer agents to comply with the Act, the extent of
    which liability will be determined by rules not yet enacted. In
    addition, rules adopted under the Act by other governmental
    agencies may subject our corporate interest rate and foreign
    exchange hedging transactions to centralized clearing and
    collateral posting requirements. Also, our Western Union
    Business Solutions (“Business Solutions”) business in
    the United States may be subjected to increased regulatory
    oversight and licensing requirements relating to the foreign
    exchange derivative products offered to certain of its customers.

Other examples of such regulatory changes are the Payment
    Services Directive (“PSD”) in the European Union
    (“EU”) which became effective in late 2009, and a
    similar law, the Funds Settlement Act, enacted in Japan in 2010.
    The PSD has changed the payments market in the EU, harmonizing
    the licensing and certain other requirements for offering
    payment and other financial services, including remittances
    within the EU. Previously, those requirements differed
    significantly among these countries. Further, the PSD and the
    Japanese law imposed new rules on payment service providers like
    Western Union. In particular, Western Union has become
    responsible for the compliance of its agents and their subagents
    in those jurisdictions who are engaged by one of our payments
    institution subsidiaries.



Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory action against Western
    Union because of actions by its agents and their subagents in
    those areas has increased. These changes could result in
    increased costs to comply with the new requirements, or in the
    event we or our agents or their subagents are unable to comply,
    could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position
    and results of operations. These laws could also increase
    competition in some or all of our areas of service. Additional
    countries are likely to adopt legislation similar to these laws.

Our fees

and/or

foreign exchange spreads may be reduced or limited because of
    regulatory initiatives or proceedings that are either industry
    wide or specifically targeted at our Company. For example,
    initiatives both in the United States and at G-8 summit meetings
    have focused on lowering international remittance costs. Also,
    Pakistan subsidizes certain remittances into the country from
    Pakistanis working abroad. Remittance companies accepting the
    subsidy are prohibited from charging fees to the sender or
    receiver. Such initiatives may have an adverse impact on our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

In 2009, one state passed a law imposing a fee on certain money
    transfer transactions, and certain other states have recently
    proposed similar legislation. Although money transfer services
    themselves are not generally subject to sales tax on money
    transfer services elsewhere in the United States, the current
    budget shortfalls in many jurisdictions, combined with continued
    federal inaction on comprehensive immigration reform, may lead
    other states or localities to impose similar taxes or fees. A
    tax or fee exclusively on money transfer services like Western
    Union could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other means
    of remittance which are not subject to the same taxes or fees.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (the “FCPA”) in the United States and
    similar laws in other countries, such as the Bribery Act in the
    United Kingdom, which generally prohibit companies and those
    acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign
    government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
    business. Some of these laws also prohibit commercial bribery.
    Because our services are offered in virtually every country of
    the world, we face a higher risk associated with FCPA and United
    Kingdom Bribery Act compliance than many other companies. Any
    determination that we have violated these laws could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial position and results
    of operations.

We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws
    in the United States and abroad which require us to turn over to
    certain government authorities the property of others held by us
    that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as
    unpaid money transfers. We hold property subject to escheat laws
    and we have an ongoing program to comply with those laws. In
    addition, we are subject to audits with regard to our
    escheatment practices. Any difference between the amounts we
    have accrued for unclaimed property and amounts that are claimed
    by a state or foreign jurisdiction could have a significant
    impact on our results of operations and cash flows. See
    “—Escheat Regulations” for further discussion.

Our business is subject to various United States federal, state
    and local laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations
    outside the United States. Our United States business is subject
    to reporting, recordkeeping and anti-money laundering provisions
    of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of
    2001, and to regulatory oversight and enforcement by the United
    States Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement
    Network, or “FinCEN.” In addition, as a money
    transmitter, we are subject to licensing, regulation and
    examination by almost all the states and the District of
    Columbia. With the advent of the EU PSD and similar legislation
    in Japan, we have become directly subject to reporting,
    recordkeeping and anti-money laundering regulations in those
    places. Our business in the EU is now subject to licensing,
    regulation and examination by regulators in Ireland and the
    United Kingdom. We are also now subject to such oversight in
    Japan. If additional countries adopt similar money transfer
    legislation, we could become subject to licensing, regulation
    and examination in those locations, as well. Further, we have
    subsidiaries that are subject to banking regulations, primarily
    those in Brazil and Austria. These subsidiaries are also subject
    to regulation, examination and supervision by the New York State
    Banking Department. Any determination that we have violated
    these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

The remittance industry has come under increasing scrutiny from
    government regulators and others in connection with its ability
    to prevent its services from being abused by people seeking to
    defraud others. In 2009, a competitor of Western Union entered
    into a multi-year, multi-million dollar settlement with the
    Federal Trade Commission over this issue. While we believe our
    fraud prevention efforts are effective and comply with



applicable law and best practices, the ingenuity of criminal
    fraudsters, combined with the potential susceptibility to fraud
    by consumers during economically difficult times, make the
    prevention of consumer fraud a significant and challenging
    problem. Our failure to continue to help prevent such frauds, an
    increase in government enforcement activity or a change in laws
    or their interpretation could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

Difficult
    conditions in the global financial markets, the global economic
    crisis and continued financial market disruptions could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

The global capital and credit markets have experienced
    unprecedented volatility and disruption in recent years and we
    face certain risks if such events reoccur, including:

•

Our agents or clients could experience reduced sales or business
    as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions. As a
    result, our agents could reduce their numbers of locations or
    hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether.
    Businesses using our services may make fewer cross-currency
    payments or may have fewer customers making payments to them
    through us, particularly businesses in those industries that may
    be more affected by an economic downturn.

•

Our revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks is one
    source for funding liquidity needs and also backs our commercial
    paper program. If any of the banks participating in our credit
    facility fails to fulfill its lending commitment to us, our
    short-term liquidity and ability to support borrowings under our
    commercial paper program could be adversely affected.

•

We may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness as it
    becomes due or we may have to refinance on unfavorable terms,
    which could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our
    cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby
    reducing funds available for working capital, capital
    expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other purposes.

•

The market value of the securities in our investment portfolio
    may substantially decline. The impact of that decline in value
    may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

•

The derivative financial instruments that we use reduce our
    exposure to various market risks including changes in interest
    rates and foreign exchange rates. Our counterparties to our
    derivative instruments may fail to honor their obligations,
    which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. That
    failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

•

We aggregate our foreign exchange exposures in our Business
    Solutions business, including the exposure generated by the
    derivative contracts we write to our customers as part of our
    cross-currency payments business, and typically hedge the net
    exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial
    institution counterparties. If our customers fail to honor their
    obligations or if the counterparties to our offsetting positions
    fail to honor their obligations, our business, financial
    position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

•

Our exposure to receivables from our agents, consumers and
    businesses could impact us. For more information on this risk,
    see risk factor,

“We face credit, liquidity and fraud
    risks from our agents, consumers and businesses that could
    adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
    operations.”

•

The third-party service providers on whom we depend may
    experience difficulties in their businesses, which may impair
    their ability to provide services to us and have a potential
    impact on our own business. The impact of a change or temporary
    stoppage of services may have an adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

•

Banks upon which we rely to conduct our businesses could fail.
    This could lead to our inability to access funds

and/or

credit losses for us and could adversely impact our ability to
    conduct our business.

•

If market disruption and volatility occurs, we could experience
    difficulty in accessing capital and our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.



Risks
    associated with operations outside the United States and foreign
    currencies could adversely affect our business, financial
    position and results of operations.

An increasing portion of our revenue is generated in currencies
    other than the United States dollar. As a result, we are subject
    to risks associated with changes in the value of our revenues
    denominated in foreign currencies. Our Business Solutions
    business provides currency conversion and foreign exchange
    hedging services to its customers, further exposing us to
    foreign currency exchange risk. In order to mitigate these
    risks, we enter into derivative contracts. However, these
    contracts do not eliminate all of the risks related to
    fluctuating foreign currency rates.

Our foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk
    management is greater in our Business Solutions business due to
    the nature of this business. The significant majority of
    Business Solutions’ revenue is from exchanges of currency
    at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency
    payments. This business also writes foreign currency forward and
    option contracts for our customers. The duration of these
    derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. Business
    Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from
    customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described
    above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering
    into offsetting contracts with established financial institution
    counterparties. If we are unable to obtain offsetting positions,
    our business, financial position and results of operations could
    be adversely affected.

A significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the
    United States and much of the cash and cash equivalents from
    this business are held by our foreign entities. Repatriating
    these funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in
    significant tax obligations because most of these funds have
    been taxed at foreign tax rates that are relatively low compared
    to our combined federal and state tax rates in the United
    States. If repatriation of these funds is required or if a
    change in legislation requires a different tax treatment, our
    business, financial position and results of operations could be
    adversely impacted. For further discussion regarding the risk
    that our future effective tax rates could be adversely impacted
    by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally,
    see risk factor “

Changes in tax laws and unfavorable
    resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax
    expense

” below.

Money transfers and payments to, from or within or between
    countries may be limited or prohibited by law. At times in the
    past, we have been required to cease operations in particular
    countries due to political uncertainties or government
    restrictions imposed by foreign governments or the United
    States. Occasionally agents have been required by their
    regulators to cease offering our services. Additionally,
    economic or political instability or natural disasters may make
    money transfers to, from or within a particular country
    difficult, such as when banks are closed, when currency
    devaluation makes exchange rates difficult to manage or when
    natural disasters or civil unrest makes access to agent
    locations unsafe. These risks could negatively impact our
    ability to make payments to or receive payments from
    international agents or our subsidiaries or our ability to
    recoup funds that have been advanced to international agents or
    are held by our subsidiaries and could adversely affect our
    business, financial position and results of operations. In
    addition, the general state of telecommunications and
    infrastructure in some lesser developed countries, including
    countries where we have a large number of transactions, creates
    operational risks for us and our agents that generally are not
    present in our operations in the United States and other more
    developed countries.

Many of our agents outside the United States are post offices,
    which are usually owned and operated by national governments.
    These governments may decide to change the terms under which
    they allow post offices to offer remittances and other financial
    services. For example, governments may decide to separate
    financial service operations from postal operations, or mandate
    the creation or privatization of a “post bank” or they
    may require multiple service providers in their network. These
    changes could have an adverse effect on our ability to
    distribute, offer or price our services in countries that are
    material to our business.

Changes
    in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies
    could adversely affect our tax expense.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally. From
    time to time, the United States Congress and foreign, state and
    local governments consider legislation that could increase our
    effective tax rates. If changes to applicable tax laws are
    enacted, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.



Our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by
    federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An
    unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax
    expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.
    We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax
    exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with
    respect to our international operations which were restructured
    in 2003, whereby our income from certain

foreign-to-foreign

money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low
    foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax
    rates in the United States. As of December 31, 2010, the
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of
    $671.1 million, including accrued interest and penalties.
    Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the
    issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe
    that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax
    risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an
    issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial
    cost that does not exceed our related reserve, and such
    resolution could have a material effect on our effective tax
    rate, financial position, results of operations and cash flows
    in the current period

and/or

future periods. With respect to these reserves, our income tax
    expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves
    arising from material changes during the period in the facts and
    circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue,
    and (ii) any difference from the Company’s tax
    position as recorded in the financial statements and the final
    resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution
    could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our
    consolidated financial statements in future periods and could
    materially impact our operating cash flows.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its
    examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax
    returns of First Data Corporation (“First Data”) for
    2003 and 2004, of which Western Union was a part, and issued a
    Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency
    alleges significant additional taxes, interest and penalties
    owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and
    our subsidiaries, and we generally have responsibility for taxes
    associated with these potential Company-related adjustments
    under the tax allocation agreement with First Data executed at
    the time of the Spin-off. We agree with a number of the
    adjustments in the Notice of Deficiency; however, we do not
    agree with the Notice of Deficiency regarding several
    substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional
    tax and penalties due of approximately $114 million. As of
    December 31, 2010, interest on the alleged amounts due for
    unagreed adjustments would be approximately $36 million. A
    substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed
    adjustments relates to our international restructuring, which
    took effect in the fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the
    alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are
    attributable to 2004. In September 2010, IRS counsel referred
    the case to the IRS Appeals Division for possible settlement. On
    March 20, 2009, we filed a petition in the United States
    Tax Court contesting those adjustments with which we do not
    agree. We believe our overall reserves are adequate, including
    those associated with the adjustments alleged in the Notice of
    Deficiency. If the IRS’ position in the Notice of
    Deficiency is sustained, our tax provision related to 2003 and
    later years would materially increase, which could materially
    impact our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows. An examination of the United States federal consolidated
    income tax returns of First Data that cover the Company’s
    2005 and pre-spin-off 2006 taxable periods is ongoing, as is an
    examination of the Company’s United States federal
    consolidated income tax returns for the 2006 post-spin-off
    period, 2007 and 2008. The Irish income tax returns of certain
    subsidiaries for the years 2006 and forward are eligible to be
    examined by the Irish tax authorities, although no examinations
    have commenced. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial
    statements for a further discussion of this matter.

Western
    Union has been the subject of

class-action

litigation, and remains the subject of other litigation as well
    as consent agreements with or enforcement actions by
    regulators.

Western Union has been the subject of

class-action

litigation in the United States, alleging that its foreign
    exchange rate disclosures failed to adequately inform consumers
    about the revenue that Western Union and its agents derive from
    international remittances. These suits were all settled in or
    before 2004, without an admission of liability, and we have made
    changes in our advertising and consumer forms. It is possible
    that because of changes in law or future litigation or
    regulatory action, we could be required to modify our
    disclosures or our practices further. These modifications could
    be costly to implement, restrict our ability to advertise or
    promote our services, limit the amount of our foreign exchange
    income

and/or

change our consumers’ behavior.



In addition, as a Company that provides global financial
    services primarily to consumers, we could be subject to future

class-action

lawsuits, other litigation or regulatory action alleging
    violations of consumer protection or other laws. We also are
    subject to claims asserted by consumers based on individual
    transactions.

In February 2010, we signed an agreement and settlement with the
    State of Arizona and other states regarding claims concerning
    our ability to prevent our service from being abused by some
    users to launder money or to facilitate other criminal activity.
    The agreement and settlement resolved all outstanding legal
    issues and claims with the State. In addition to certain
    investments in, and changes to, our anti-money laundering
    compliance obligations in the region during the term of the
    agreement, we are required to fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. The settlement relates to
    a number of lawsuits in which we and the State of Arizona were
    parties. The issues in those cases related to subpoenas for
    transaction data and the State’s attempt to seize money
    transfers originated in states other than Arizona and intended
    for payment in Mexico. Additional civil actions or any criminal
    actions could adversely affect our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Antitrust Division of the
    United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) served one
    of our subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena requesting
    documents in connection with an investigation into money
    transfers, including related foreign exchange rates, from the
    United States to the Dominican Republic from 2004 through the
    date of the subpoena. The Company is cooperating fully with the
    DOJ investigation. Due to the stage of the investigation, we are
    unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the
    possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be
    associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges
    or civil claims that may be brought against us. Should such
    charges or claims be brought, we could face significant fines,
    damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations.

We are a defendant in two purported class action lawsuits: James
    P. Tennille v. The Western Union Company, and Robert P.
    Smet v. The Western Union Company, both of which are
    pending in the United States District Court for the District of
    Colorado. The complaints assert claims for violation of various
    consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, conversion and
    declaratory relief, based on allegations that we wait too long
    to inform consumers if their money transfers are not redeemed by
    the recipients and that we use the unredeemed funds to generate
    income until the funds are escheated to state governments. The
    Tennille complaint was served on us on April 27, 2009. The
    Smet complaint was served on us on April 6, 2010. On
    September 21, 2009, the Court granted our motion to dismiss
    the Tennille complaint and gave the plaintiff leave to file an
    amended complaint. On October 21, 2009, Tennille filed an
    amended complaint. We moved to dismiss the Tennille amended
    complaint and the Smet complaint. On November 8, 2010, the
    Court denied our motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffs’
    unjust enrichment and conversion claims. On February 4,
    2011, the Court dismissed plaintiffs’ consumer protection
    claims. The plaintiffs have not sought and the Court has not
    granted class certification. We intend to vigorously defend
    ourselves against both lawsuits. However, due to the preliminary
    stages of these lawsuits, the fact the plaintiffs have not
    quantified their damage demands, and the uncertainty as to
    whether they will ever be certified as class actions, we are
    unable to determine the potential outcome.

Over the past several years, we have entered into consent
    agreements with federal and state authorities, including FinCEN,
    the New York State Banking Department, the California Department
    of Financial Institutions and the Arizona Department of
    Financial Institutions, relating to the Bank Secrecy Act and
    anti-money laundering requirements and related consumer
    identification matters. These agreements required us to pay
    civil penalties and to take certain measures to enhance our
    compliance with recordkeeping, reporting, training and agent
    oversight requirements under applicable state and federal law.
    The consent agreements with the New York State Banking
    Department and the California Department of Financial
    Institutions were lifted during 2008. However, the financial
    services industry and businesses like ours continue to be under
    significant federal and state regulatory scrutiny with respect
    to the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance
    matters. It is possible that as a result of periodic
    examinations or otherwise, we could be subject to deficiency
    findings, fines, criminal penalties, asset seizures or
    enforcement actions that could adversely affect our business,
    financial position and results of operations.



Acquisitions
    and integration of new businesses create risks and may affect
    operating results.

We have acquired and may acquire businesses both inside and
    outside the United States. The acquisition and integration of
    businesses involve a number of risks. The core risks involve
    valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on
    inherently limited due diligence) and integration (managing the
    complex process of integrating the acquired company’s
    people, products and services, technology and other assets in an
    effort to realize the projected value of the acquired company
    and the projected synergies of the acquisition). In addition,
    the need in some cases to improve regulatory compliance
    standards is another risk associated with acquiring companies.
    Acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks
    including, for example:

•

managing geographically separated organizations, systems and
    facilities;

•

managing multi-jurisdictional operating, tax and financing
    structures;

•

integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and
    organizational cultures;

•

integrating the acquired technologies into our Company;

•

realization of anticipated financial benefits from these
    acquisitions and where necessary, improving internal controls of
    these acquired businesses;

•

complying with regulatory requirements;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign
    countries;

•

difficulty entering new markets with the services of the
    acquired business; and

•

general economic and political conditions, including legal and
    other barriers to cross-border investment in general, or by
    United States companies in particular.

Integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or divert
    resources from, one or more of our businesses and could result
    in the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management’s
    attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in
    connection with an acquisition and the integration of the
    acquired company’s operations could have an adverse effect
    on our business, financial position and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $2,151.7 million of
    goodwill comprising approximately 27% of our total assets. An
    impairment review of goodwill is conducted at least once a year
    and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be
    recoverable. If we are unsuccessful in integrating the
    businesses we have acquired or acquire in the future, or if
    these acquired businesses experience declines in operating
    income or cash flows, adverse changes in the business climate,
    or if we are unable to successfully execute our strategy for
    these businesses, we may be required to write down the goodwill
    on our balance sheet associated with these acquisitions, which
    could have an impact on our financial position and results of
    operations in future periods.

Our
    consolidated balance sheet may not contain sufficient amounts or
    types of regulatory capital to meet the changing requirements of
    our various regulators worldwide, which could adversely affect
    our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

We have substantial indebtedness as of December 31, 2010.
    Our regulators expect us to possess sufficient financial
    soundness and strength to adequately support our regulated
    subsidiaries. In addition, although we are not a bank holding
    company for purposes of United States law or the law of any
    other jurisdiction, as a global provider of payments services
    and in light of the changing regulatory environment in various
    jurisdictions, we could become subject to new capital
    requirements introduced or imposed by our regulators that could
    require us to issue securities that would qualify as Tier 1
    regulatory capital under the Basel Committee accords or retain
    earnings over a period of time. Any of these requirements could
    adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
    operations.



If
    consumers’ confidence in our business or in traditional
    money transfer providers generally deteriorates, our business,
    financial position and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

Our business is built on consumers’ confidence in our
    brands and our ability to provide fast, reliable money transfer
    services. Erosion in consumers’ confidence in our business,
    or in traditional money transfer providers as a means to
    transfer money, could adversely impact transaction volumes which
    would in turn adversely impact our business, financial position
    and results of operations.

A number of factors could adversely affect consumers’
    confidence in our business, or in traditional money transfer
    providers generally, many of which are beyond our control, and
    could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. These
    factors include:

•

changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations that have the
    effect of making it more difficult for consumers to transfer
    money using traditional money transfer providers;

•

actions by federal, state or foreign regulators that interfere
    with our ability to transfer consumers’ money reliably, for
    example, attempts to seize money transfer funds;

•

federal, state or foreign legal requirements, including those
    that require us to provide consumer data to a greater extent
    than is currently required;

•

any significant interruption in our systems, including by fire,
    natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure,
    terrorism, vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer
    viruses; and

•

any breach of our security policies or legal requirements
    resulting in a compromise of consumer data.

Many of our money transfer consumers are migrants. Consumer
    advocacy groups or governmental agencies could consider the
    migrants to be disadvantaged and entitled to protection,
    enhanced consumer disclosure, or other different treatment. If
    governments implement new laws or regulations that limit our
    right to set fees

and/or

foreign exchange spreads, or if consumer advocacy groups are
    able to generate widespread support for positions that are
    detrimental to our business, then our business, financial
    position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We
    face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents,
    consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our
    business, financial position and results of
    operations.

The vast majority of our global funds transfer business is
    conducted through third-party agents that provide our services
    to consumers at their retail locations. These agents sell our
    services, collect funds from consumers and are required to pay
    the proceeds from these transactions to us. As a result, we have
    credit exposure to our agents. In some countries, our agent
    networks include superagents that establish subagent
    relationships; these agents must collect funds from their
    subagents in order to pay us. We are not insured against credit
    losses, except in certain circumstances related to agent theft
    or fraud. If an agent becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy,
    commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay money order, money
    transfer or payment services proceeds to us, we must nonetheless
    pay the money order, complete the money transfer or payment
    services on behalf of the consumer.

The liquidity of our agents is necessary for our business to
    remain strong and to continue to provide our services. If our
    agents fail to settle with us in a timely manner, our liquidity
    could be affected.

From time to time, we have made, and may in the future make,
    short term advances and longer term loans to our agents. These
    advances and loans generally are secured by settlement funds
    payable by us to these agents. However, the failure of these
    borrowing agents to repay these advances and loans constitutes a
    credit risk to us.

In our Business Solutions business, we are also exposed to
    credit risk relating to foreign currency forward and option
    contracts written by us to our customers. The duration of these
    derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. The
    credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases
    when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers,
    possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to
    deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral
    with us. If a customer becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy,
    commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us for the value of
    these contracts, we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting
    position with a financial institution counterparty.



We offer consumers, primarily in the United States, the ability
    to transfer money utilizing their credit or debit card via the
    internet and telephone. Because they are not

face-to-face

transactions, these transactions involve a greater risk of
    fraud. We apply verification and other tools to help
    authenticate transactions and protect against fraud. However,
    these tools are not always successful in protecting us against
    fraud. As the merchant of these transactions, we may bear the
    financial risk of the full amount sent in some of the fraudulent
    transactions. Issuers of credit and debit cards may also incur
    losses due to fraudulent transactions through our distribution
    channels and may elect to block transactions by their
    cardholders in these channels with or without notice. For
    example, during 2007, we received notification from several
    issuing banks that credit or debit cards issued by them were
    blocked from transacting on westernunion.com. Although these
    banks subsequently have allowed our consumers to use their cards
    again on our website, there is no certainty that these banks
    will not issue a similar restriction in the future, and as a
    result, we may continue to be impacted by notifications such as
    these in the future. Additionally, we may be subject to
    additional fees or penalties if the amount of chargebacks
    exceeds a certain percentage of our transaction volume. Such
    fees and penalties escalate over time if we do not take
    effective action to reduce chargebacks below the threshold, and
    if chargeback levels are not ultimately reduced to acceptable
    levels, our merchant accounts could be suspended or revoked,
    which would adversely affect our results of operations.

Breaches
    of our information security policies or safeguards could
    adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our
    reputation, business, financial position and results of
    operations.

We collect, transfer and retain consumer, employee and agent
    data as part of our business. These activities are subject to
    laws and regulations in the United States and other
    jurisdictions. The requirements imposed by these laws and
    regulations, which often differ materially among the many
    jurisdictions, are designed to protect the privacy of personal
    information and to prevent that information from being
    inappropriately disclosed. We have developed and maintain
    technical and operational safeguards designed to comply with
    applicable legal requirements. However, despite those
    safeguards, it is possible that hackers, employees acting
    contrary to our policies or others could improperly access our
    systems or improperly obtain or disclose data about our
    consumers, agents

and/or

employees. Further, because some data is collected and stored by
    third parties, it is possible that a third party could
    intentionally or negligently disclose personal data in violation
    of law. Also, in some jurisdictions we transfer data related to
    our employees, consumers, agents and potential employees to
    third-party vendors in order to perform due diligence and for
    other reasons. It is possible that a vendor could intentionally
    or inadvertently disclose such data. Any breach of our security
    policies or applicable legal requirements resulting in a
    compromise of consumer, employee or agent data could require us
    to notify impacted individuals, and in some cases regulators, of
    a possible or actual breach, expose us to regulatory enforcement
    action, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to
    litigation

and/or

damage our reputation.

Interruptions
    in our systems or disruptions in our workforce may have a
    significant effect on our business.

Our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the
    efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer
    information systems and those of our service providers. Any
    significant interruptions could harm our business and reputation
    and result in a loss of consumers. These systems and operations
    could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural
    disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism,
    vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or other
    causes, many of which may be beyond our control or that of our
    service providers. Although we have taken steps to prevent
    systems failure, our measures may not be successful and we may
    experience problems other than system failures. We also may
    experience software defects, development delays, installation
    difficulties and other systems problems, which would harm our
    business and reputation and expose us to potential liability
    which may not be fully covered by our business interruption
    insurance. Our data applications may not be sufficient to
    address technological advances, regulatory requirements,
    changing market conditions or other developments. In addition,
    any work stoppages or other labor actions by employees, the
    significant majority of which are located outside the United
    States, who support our systems or perform any of our major
    functions could adversely affect our business.



If we
    are unable to maintain our agent, subagent or global business
    payments networks under terms consistent with those currently in
    place, or if our agents or subagents fail to comply with Western
    Union business and technology standards and contract
    requirements or applicable laws and regulations, our business,
    financial position and results of operations would be adversely
    affected.

Most of our

consumer-to-consumer

revenue is derived through our agent network. In addition, our
    international agents may have subagent relationships in which we
    are not directly involved. Transaction volumes at existing agent
    and subagent locations often increase over time and new agents
    and subagents provide us with additional revenue. If, due to
    competition or other reasons, agents or subagents decide to
    leave our network, or if we are unable to sign new agents or
    maintain our agent network under terms consistent with those
    currently in place, or if our agents are unable to maintain
    relationships with or sign new subagents, our revenue and profit
    growth rates may be adversely affected. Agent attrition might
    occur for a number of reasons, including a competitor engaging
    an agent or an agent’s dissatisfaction with its
    relationship with us or the revenue derived from that
    relationship. In addition, agents may generate fewer
    transactions or less revenue for various reasons, including
    increased competition or changes in the economy. Because an
    agent is a third party that engages in a variety of activities
    in addition to providing our services, it may encounter business
    difficulties unrelated to its provision of our services, which
    could cause the agent to reduce its number of locations, hours
    of operation, or cease doing business altogether.

We rely on our agents’ information systems

and/or

processes to obtain transaction data. If an agent or subagent
    loses information, if there is a significant disruption to the
    information systems of an agent or subagent, or if an agent or
    subagent does not maintain the appropriate controls over their
    systems, we may experience reputational harm which could result
    in losses to the Company.

The types of enterprises that are legally authorized to act as
    our agents vary significantly from one country to another.
    Changes in the laws affecting the kinds of entities that are
    permitted to act as money transfer agents (such as changes in
    requirements for capitalization or ownership) could adversely
    affect our ability to distribute our services and the cost of
    providing such services, both by us and our agents. For example,
    a requirement that a money transfer provider be a bank or other
    highly regulated financial entity could increase significantly
    the cost of providing our services in many countries where that
    requirement does not exist today or could prevent us from
    offering our services in an affected country. Further, any
    changes in law that would require us to provide directly the
    money transfer services to consumers as opposed to through an
    agent network—effectively changing our business
    model—could significantly adversely impact our ability to
    provide our services,

and/or

the
    cost of our services, in the relevant jurisdiction. Changes
    mandated by laws which make Western Union responsible for any
    acts of its agents while they are providing the Western Union
    money transfer service increase our risk of regulatory liability
    and our costs to monitor our agents’ performance.

Our agents are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements,
    which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject
    to change. A material change in the regulatory requirements
    necessary to offer money transfer services in a jurisdiction
    important to our business could mean increased costs

and/or

operational demands on our agents, which could result in the
    attrition of agents and subagents, a decrease in the number of
    locations at which money transfer services are offered and other
    negative consequences. The regulatory status of our agents could
    affect their ability to offer our services. For example, our
    agents in the United States are considered Money Service
    Businesses, or “MSBs,” under the Bank Secrecy Act. An
    increasing number of banks view MSBs, as a class, as higher risk
    customers for purposes of their anti-money laundering programs.
    Furthermore, some of our domestic and international agents have
    had difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships
    due to the banks’ policies. If a significant number of
    agents are unable to maintain existing or establish new banking
    relationships, they may not be able to continue to offer our
    services.

Although most of our Orlandi Valuta and Vigo branded agents are
    not exclusive, most of our Western Union branded agents have
    offered our services on an exclusive basis—that is, they
    have agreed by contract not to provide any non-Western Union
    branded money transfer services. While we expect to continue
    signing agents under exclusive arrangements and believe that
    these agreements are valid and enforceable, changes in laws
    regulating competition or in the interpretation of those laws
    could undermine our ability to enforce them in the future.
    Recently, several countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
    States, Africa and South Asia, including India, have promulgated
    laws or regulations that effectively prohibit payment service
    providers, such as money transfer



companies, from agreeing to exclusive arrangements with agents
    in those countries. Certain institutions, non-governmental
    organizations (NGOs) and others are actively advocating against
    exclusive arrangements in money transfer agent agreements.
    Advocates for laws prohibiting or limiting exclusivity continue
    to push for enactment of similar laws in other jurisdictions. In
    addition, certain of our agents and subagents have refused to
    enter into exclusive arrangements. The inability to enter into
    exclusive arrangements or to enforce our exclusivity rights
    under our contracts could adversely affect our operations and
    revenue by, for example, allowing competitors to benefit from
    the goodwill associated with the Western Union brand at our
    agent locations.

We have relationships with more than 6,400 businesses to which
    our customers can make payments. These relationships are a core
    component of our global business payments services, and we
    derive a substantial portion of our global business payments
    revenue through these relationships. If we are unable to sign
    new relationships or maintain our current relationships under
    terms consistent with those currently in place, our revenue and
    profit growth rates may be adversely affected.

Our
    business, financial position and results of operations could be
    harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating
    agencies.

Currently, each of the major credit rating agencies has given
    our outstanding indebtedness an investment grade rating. If our
    current rating is downgraded, or if a negative outlook is
    provided by a rating agency, our business, financial position
    and results of operations could be adversely affected and
    perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. This
    could adversely affect our relationships with our agents,
    particularly those agents that are financial institutions or
    post offices. In addition, if a downgrade or a negative outlook
    is provided by a rating agency, it could result in regulators
    imposing additional capital and other requirements on us,
    including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated
    subsidiaries to pay dividends. Also, a significant downgrade
    could increase our costs of borrowing money, adversely affecting
    our business, financial position and results of operations.

We
    face competition from global and niche or corridor money
    transfer providers, United States and international banks, card
    associations, card-based payments providers and a number of
    other types of service providers, including electronic and
    internet providers. Our continued growth depends on our ability
    to compete effectively in the industry.

Money transfer and global business payments are highly
    competitive industries which include service providers from a
    variety of financial and non-financial business groups. Our
    competitors include banks, credit unions, ATM providers and
    operators, card associations, card-based payments providers such
    as issuers of

e-money,

travel cards or stored-value cards, informal remittance systems,
    web-based services, telephone payment systems (including mobile
    phone networks), postal organizations, retailers, check cashers,
    mail and courier services, currency exchanges and traditional
    money transfer companies. These services are differentiated by
    features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network
    size, hours of operations, loyalty programs, reliability and
    price. Our continued growth depends on our ability to compete
    effectively in these industries. We have made periodic pricing
    decreases in response to competition and to implement our brand
    investment strategy, which includes better meeting consumer
    needs, maximizing market opportunities and strengthening our
    overall competitive positioning. Pricing decreases generally
    reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will
    result in increased transaction volumes. In addition, failure to
    compete on service differentiation could significantly affect
    our future growth potential and results of operations.

As noted above, many of our agents outside the United States are
    national post offices. These entities are usually governmental
    organizations that may enjoy special privileges or protections
    that could allow them to simultaneously develop their own money
    transfer businesses. International postal organizations could
    agree to establish a money transfer network among themselves.
    Due to the size of these organizations and the number of
    locations they have, any such network could represent
    significant competition to us. Because these entities are
    governmental organizations, they may be able to—or be
    required to—offer their money transfer services to the
    public at, near or below their cost of providing such services.



Our
    ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to
    protect our brands and our other intellectual property rights
    and to defend ourselves against potential patent infringement
    claims.

The Western Union brand, which is protected by trademark
    registrations in many countries, is material to our Company. The
    loss of the Western Union trademark or a diminution in the
    perceived quality associated with the name would harm our
    business. Similar to the Western Union trademark, the Vigo,
    Orlandi Valuta, Speedpay, Paymap, Equity Accelerator, Just in
    Time EFT, Pago Fácil, Western Union Payments, Western Union
    Quick Collect, Quick Pay, Quick Cash, Convenience Pay, Western
    Union Business Solutions and other trademarks and service marks
    are also important to our Company and a loss of the service mark
    or trademarks or a diminution in the perceived quality
    associated with these names could harm our business.

Our intellectual property rights are an important element in the
    value of our business. Our failure to take appropriate actions
    against those who infringe upon our intellectual property could
    adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business
    either do not recognize intellectual property rights or do not
    protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United
    States. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative
    proceedings in the United States or in foreign countries could
    impair our ability to sell our services or license or protect
    our intellectual property, which could adversely affect our
    business, financial position and results of operations.

We have been, are and in the future may be, subject to claims
    alleging that our technology or business methods infringe
    patents owned by others, both inside and outside the United
    States. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could require us
    to change how we deliver a service, result in significant
    financial consequences, or both, which could adversely affect
    our business, financial position and results of operations.

We
    receive services from third-party vendors that would be
    difficult to replace if those vendors ceased providing such
    services which could cause temporary disruption to our
    business.

Some services relating to our business, such as software
    application support, the development, hosting and maintenance of
    our operating systems, check clearing, and processing of
    returned checks are outsourced to third-party vendors, which
    would be difficult to replace quickly. If our third-party
    vendors were unwilling or unable to provide us with these
    services in the future, our business and operations could be
    adversely affected.

Material
    changes in the market value or liquidity of the securities we
    hold may adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.

As of December 31, 2010, we held $1.4 billion in
    investment securities, substantially all of which are high
    quality investment grade state and municipal debt securities.
    The majority of this money represents the principal of money
    transfers sent by consumers and money orders issued by us to
    consumers in the United States. Under the PSD in the EU, we
    expect to have a similar portfolio of investment securities,
    which we will manage in a similar manner and under similar
    guidelines as our current portfolio. We regularly monitor our
    credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high
    quality investments and by diversifying our investments. At
    December 31, 2010, the majority of our investment
    securities had credit ratings of “AA-” or better from
    a major credit rating agency. Despite those ratings, it is
    possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the
    future due to any number of factors, including general market
    conditions, credit issues, the viability of the issuer of the
    security, failure by a fund manager to manage the investment
    portfolio consistently with the fund prospectus or increases in
    interest rates. Any such decline in value may adversely affect
    our results of operations and financial condition.

The trust holding the assets of our pension plans has assets
    totaling approximately $290.1 million as of
    December 31, 2010. The fair value of these assets held in
    the trust are compared to the plans’ projected benefit
    obligation to determine the pension liability of
    $112.8 million recorded within “Other
    liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2010. We attempt to mitigate risk through
    diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk on our
    portfolio through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and
    periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it
    is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the



future due to any number of factors, including general market
    conditions and credit issues. Such declines could have an impact
    on the funded status of our pension plans and future funding
    requirements.

We
    have substantial debt obligations that could restrict our
    operations.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    $3.3 billion in consolidated indebtedness, and we may also
    incur additional indebtedness in the future.

Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:

•

limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;

•

increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory
    and industry conditions;

•

limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning
    for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;

•

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds
    available for working capital, capital expenditures,
    acquisitions and other purposes.

There would be adverse tax consequences associated with using
    certain earnings generated outside the United States to pay the
    interest and principal on our indebtedness. Accordingly, this
    portion of our cash flow will be unavailable under normal
    circumstances to service our debt obligations.

Risks
    Relating to the Spin-Off

We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29,
    2006, First Data distributed 100% of its money transfer and
    consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union
    money transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real
    estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data
    shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously
    owned subsidiary.

If the
    Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, First Data
    and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of
    taxes and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to
    indemnify First Data for material taxes pursuant to
    indemnification obligations under the tax allocation
    agreement.

First Data received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the
    effect that, the Spin-off (including certain related
    transactions) qualifies as tax-free to First Data, us and First
    Data stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes
    under sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code, assuming, among other things, the
    accuracy of the representations made by First Data with respect
    to certain matters on which the IRS did not rule. If the factual
    assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling
    request were determined to be untrue or incomplete, then First
    Data and ourselves would not be able to rely on the ruling.

The Spin-off was conditioned upon First Data’s receipt of
    an opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, counsel to First Data, to the
    effect that, with respect to requirements on which the IRS did
    not rule, those requirements would be satisfied. The opinion was
    based on, among other things, certain assumptions and
    representations as to factual matters made by First Data and us
    which, if untrue or incomplete, would jeopardize the conclusions
    reached by counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on
    the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree
    with the opinion.

If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and
    opinion of tax counsel, the Spin-off were determined to be a
    taxable transaction, each holder of First Data common stock who
    received shares of our common stock in connection with the
    Spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable
    distribution in an amount equal to the fair value of our common
    stock received. First Data would recognize taxable gain equal to
    the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by
    First Data in the contribution over First Data’s tax basis
    in the assets contributed to us in the contribution. If First
    Data were unable to pay any taxes for which it is responsible
    under the tax allocation agreement, the IRS might seek to
    collect such taxes from Western Union.



Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualified as a tax-free
    distribution under section 355 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, the Spin-off may result in significant United States
    federal income tax liabilities to First Data if 50% or more of
    First Data’s stock or our stock (in each case, by vote or
    value) is treated as having been acquired, directly or
    indirectly, by one or more persons as part of a plan (or series
    of related transactions) that includes the Spin-off. For
    purposes of this test, any acquisitions, or any understanding,
    arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an
    acquisition, within two years before or after the Spin-off are
    subject to special scrutiny.

With respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be
    imposed as a result of a final determination that is
    inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the
    Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant
    tax opinion) (“Spin-off Related Taxes”), we, one of
    our affiliates or any person that, after the Spin-off, is an
    affiliate thereof, will be liable to First Data for any such
    Spin-off Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by
    or with respect to us. In addition, we will also be liable for
    50% of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that would not have
    been imposed but for the existence of both an action by us and
    an action by First Data or (ii) where we and First Data
    each take actions that, standing alone, would have resulted in
    the imposition of such Spin-off Related Taxes. We may be
    similarly liable if we breach certain representations or
    covenants set forth in the tax allocation agreement. If we are
    required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result
    of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would
    have an adverse effect on our business, financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

PROPERTIES

Properties
    and Facilities

As of December 31, 2010, we have offices in approximately
    50 countries, which includes three owned facilities and
    approximately 20 United States and 340 international leased
    properties. Our owned facilities include our corporate
    headquarters located in Englewood, Colorado.

Our owned and leased facilities are used for operational, sales
    and administrative purposes in support of both our

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments segments and are all currently
    being utilized. In certain locations, our offices include
    customer service centers, where our employees answer operational
    questions from agents and customers. Our office in Dublin,
    Ireland serves as our international headquarters.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our
    current business; however, we periodically review our facility
    requirements and may acquire new facilities to meet the needs of
    our businesses or consolidate and dispose of or sublet
    facilities which are no longer required.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

On July 26, 2010, U.F.C.W. Local 1776 & Participating
    Employers Pension Fund filed a Verified Shareholder Double
    Derivative Complaint and Jury Demand in United States District
    Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the
    Company’s Board of Directors failed to appropriately
    oversee the Company’s compliance program, particularly in
    regard to the alleged deficiencies which resulted in the
    Company’s agreement and settlement with the State of
    Arizona and other states in early 2010. In addition to naming
    the Company’s Board members as individual defendants, the
    complaint names the Company and its subsidiary Western Union
    Financial Services, Inc. as nominal defendants. The complaint
    seeks damages from the individual defendants for breach of
    fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and an order
    requiring various corrective measures. On September 10,
    2010, the United States District Court for the District of
    Colorado dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter
    jurisdiction. On September 23, 2010, the plaintiff re-filed
    the complaint in Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona. The
    complaint was removed to the United States District Court  for
    the District of Arizona. The Company has moved to dismiss the
    complaint on jurisdictional grounds.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Antitrust Division of the
    United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) served one
    of the Company’s subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena
    requesting documents in connection with an investigation into
    money transfers, including related foreign exchange rates, from
    the United States to the



Dominican Republic from 2004 through the date of subpoena. The
    Company is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. Due to
    the stage of the investigation, the Company is unable to predict
    the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss or range
    of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution
    of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be
    brought against the Company. Should such charges or claims be
    brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards
    or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s business, financial position and
    results of operations.

The Company is a party to a variety of legal proceedings that
    arise in the normal course of our business. While the results of
    these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings
    will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial position.

    2011, the Board of Directors authorized an additional
    $1 billion of common stock repurchases through
    December 31, 2012. Management has and may continue to
    establish prearranged written plans pursuant to

Rule 10b5-1.

A

Rule 10b5-1

plan permits us to repurchase shares at times when we may
    otherwise be unable to do so, provided the plan is adopted when
    we are not aware of material non-public information.

Refer to Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements
    for information related to our equity compensation plans.

Dividend
    Policy

On December 8, 2010 our Board of Directors declared a cash
    dividend of $0.07 per share payable on December 31, 2010.
    During 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors declared
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per common share payable on
    March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010 and October 14,
    2010. On December 9, 2009, our Board of Directors declared
    a cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable on December 30,
    2009. The



declaration and amount of future dividends will be determined by
    our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial
    condition, earnings, capital requirements, regulatory
    constraints, industry practice and any other factors that our
    Board of Directors believes are relevant. As a holding company
    with no material assets other than the capital stock of our
    subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends in future periods
    will be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating
    subsidiaries. Several of our operating subsidiaries are subject
    to financial services regulations and their ability to pay
    dividends may be restricted.

On February 25, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share payable on
    March 31, 2011.

SELECTED
    FINANCIAL DATA

The financial information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

is presented on a consolidated basis and includes the accounts
    of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries. The
    financial information for the periods presented prior to our
    spin-off (the “Spin-off”) from First Data Corporation
    (“First Data”) on September 29, 2006 (the
    “Spin-off Date”) is presented on a combined basis and
    represents those entities that were ultimately transferred to us
    as part of the Spin-off. The assets and liabilities presented
    have been reflected on a historical basis, as prior to the
    Spin-off such assets and liabilities presented were 100% owned
    by First Data. However, the financial statements for the periods
    presented prior to the Spin-off do not include all of the actual
    expenses that would have been incurred had Western Union been a
    stand-alone entity during the periods presented and do not
    reflect Western Union’s combined results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows had Western Union been a
    stand-alone company during the periods presented.

Our selected historical financial data are not necessarily
    indicative of our future financial position, future results of
    operations or future cash flows.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction
    with our historical consolidated financial statements and the
    notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with
    the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those
    statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Certain statements contained in the Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical
    facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates,
    assumptions and projections about our industry, business and
    future financial results. Our actual results could differ
    materially from the results contemplated by these
    forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including
    those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-looking
    Statements.”

Overview

We are a leading provider of money movement services, operating
    in two business segments:

•

Consumer-to-consumer—money

transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global
    network of third-party agents using our multi-currency,
    real-time money transfer processing systems. This service is
    available for international cross-border transfers—that is,
    the transfer of funds from one country to another—and, in
    certain countries, intra-country transfers—that is, money
    transfers from one location to another in the same country.

•

Global business payments—the processing of payments from
    consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business
    payments services allow consumers to make payments to a variety
    of organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies,
    mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government
    agencies and other businesses. In September 2009, we acquired
    Canada-based Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom House”), a
    provider of international

business-to-business

payment services, which is included in this segment. Custom
    House, which has been rebranded “Western Union Business
    Solutions” (“Business Solutions”) in September
    2010, facilitates cross-border, cross-currency payment
    transactions. The international expansion and other key
    strategic initiatives have resulted in international revenue
    continuing to increase in this segment. However, the majority of
    the segment’s revenue was generated in the United States
    during all periods presented.

Businesses not considered part of the segments described above
    are categorized as “Other” and primarily include our
    money order services, and represented 2% or less of consolidated
    revenue during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008. Prior to October 1, 2009, the Company’s money
    orders were issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc.
    (“IPS”), a subsidiary of First Data Corporation
    (“First Data”), to consumers at retail locations
    primarily in the United States and Canada. Effective
    October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility for issuing
    money orders.

Also included in “Other” are expenses incurred in
    connection with the development of certain new service
    offerings, including costs to develop mobile money transfer
    services, new prepaid service offerings and costs incurred in
    connection with mergers and acquisitions.

Significant
    Financial and Other Highlights

Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 included:

•

We generated $5,192.7 million in total consolidated
    revenues compared to $5,083.6 million in the prior year,
    representing a

year-over-year

increase of 2%. The acquisition of Custom House contributed
    $111.0 million and $30.8 million to revenue for 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

•

We incurred $59.5 million of restructuring and related
    expenses as described within “Operating expenses
    overview.” We expect to incur approximately
    $50 million in additional expenses in 2011 for a total of
    approximately $110 million related to the actions announced
    on May 27, 2010 and as subsequently revised. No
    restructuring and related expenses were recognized in 2009.



•

We generated $1,300.1 million in consolidated operating
    income compared to $1,282.7 million in the prior year,
    representing an increase of 1%. The current year results include
    the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above. The
    prior year results included an accrual of $71.0 million
    resulting from an agreement and settlement which includes the
    resolution of all outstanding legal issues and claims with the
    State of Arizona and a multi-state agreement to fund a

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border (the “settlement accrual”).

•

Our operating income margin was 25% during the year ended
    December 31, 2010, which is flat

year-over-year.

The current year results include the restructuring and related
    expenses mentioned above, while the prior year results include
    the settlement accrual mentioned above.

•

Consolidated net income was $909.9 million, representing an
    increase of 7% from 2009. The current year results include
    $39.3 million in restructuring and related expenses, net of
    tax. The prior year results include the settlement accrual of
    $53.9 million, net of tax.

•

Our consumers transferred $76 billion in

consumer-to-consumer

principal, of which $69 billion related to cross-border
    principal, which represented an increase of 6% in both

consumer-to-consumer

principal and cross-border principal over the prior year.

•

Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were
    $994.4 million, a decrease of 18% over 2009. This decrease
    was primarily the result of a $250 million refundable tax
    deposit we made relating to potential United States federal tax
    liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international
    restructuring, which have been previously accrued for in our
    financial statements.

•

We issued $250 million of aggregate principal amount of our
    6.200% notes due 2040 (“2040 Notes”) during the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

•

We exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount
    of our 5.400% notes due 2011 (“2011 Notes”) for
    $324.9 million aggregate principal amount of 5.253%
    (effective rate of 5.7%) notes due 2020 (“2020 Notes”)
    during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Our strategic priorities for ensuring our long-term success
    include accelerating profitable growth in our retail channels,
    expanding our electronic channels to offer more choice and gain
    new consumers, developing new products and services for our
    consumers and improving our processes and productivity to help
    drive growth and improve our profitability. Significant factors
    affecting our financial position and results of operations
    include:

•

Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our
    businesses. Transaction volume in our

consumer-to-consumer

segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the
    international migrant population and individual needs to
    transfer funds in emergency situations. As noted elsewhere in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions
    in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities
    including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws,
    economic development patterns or political events, could
    adversely affect our transaction volume. For discussion on how
    these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the

consumer-to-consumer

segment discussion below.

•

Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge
    consumers, the principal sent per transaction and by the
    variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the
    rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. We
    intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions
    and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where
    appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and
    including competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign
    exchange spreads generally reduce margins, but are done in
    anticipation that they will result in increased transaction
    volumes and increased revenues over time.

•

A majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent
    commissions, which are generally variable and fluctuate as
    revenues fluctuate.

•

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and
    foreign exchange revenue. The impact to earnings per share is
    less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses
    and our foreign currency hedging program.



Spin-off
    from First Data

We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29,
    2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and
    consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union
    money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including
    real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data
    shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously
    owned subsidiary.

Basis
    of Presentation

The financial statements in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts
    of our Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
    eliminated.

Components
    of Revenues and Expenses

The following briefly describes the components of revenues and
    expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income.
    Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in
    Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies” in our consolidated financial statements.

Transaction fees

—Transaction fees are charged for
    sending money transfers and for global business payments
    services.

Consumer-to-consumer

transaction fees generally vary according to the principal
    amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which
    the funds are sent and received. Transaction fees represented
    78% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Foreign exchange revenues

—In certain consumer money
    transfer and global business payments transactions involving
    different currencies, we generate revenues based on the
    difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer
    and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire
    currency. Foreign exchange revenues growth has historically been
    primarily driven by growth in international cross-currency
    transactions. As a result of the acquisition of Custom House,
    our foreign exchange revenues have increased. Foreign exchange
    revenues represented 20% of our total consolidated revenues for
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

Commission and other revenues

—Commission and other
    revenues primarily consist of commissions and fees we receive in
    connection with the sale of money orders, investment income
    primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer,
    money order and payment services settlement assets as well as
    realized net gains and losses from such assets and enrollment
    fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator
    program (a recurring mortgage payment service program).
    Commission and other revenues represented 2% of our total
    consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    As described above, prior to October 1, 2009, our money
    orders were issued by IPS, from whom we received a commission.
    Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility
    for issuing money orders and no longer receive a commission from
    IPS. We now recognize fees and investment income derived from
    interest generated on money order settlement assets as well as
    realized net gains and losses from such assets similar to our
    money transfer and payment services settlement assets.

Cost of services—

Cost of services primarily consists
    of agent commissions, which represent approximately 70% of total
    cost of services, and expenses for call centers, settlement
    operations, and related information technology costs. Expenses
    within these functions include personnel, software, equipment,
    telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and
    other expenses incurred in connection with providing money
    transfer and other payment services.

Selling, general and administrative

—Selling, general
    and administrative, or “SG&A,” primarily consists
    of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and
    administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and
    promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses.

Interest income

—Interest income consists of interest
    earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement
    obligations and in connection with loans previously made to
    several existing agents.

Interest expense

—Interest expense represents
    interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings,
    including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps.



Derivative losses, net

—Represents the portion of the
    change in fair value of foreign currency accounting hedges that
    is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, which
    includes (a) differences between changes in forward rates
    and spot rates and (b) gains or losses on the contract and
    any offsetting positions during periods in which the instrument
    is not designated as a hedge. Although the majority of changes
    in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss until settlement (i.e., spot rate
    changes), the remaining portion of changes in value are
    recognized in income as they occur. Derivative gains and losses
    do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward
    contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement
    activities of our

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer business or on certain foreign currency
    denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with
    those foreign currency forward contracts are included in
    selling, general and administrative expenses. Derivative gains
    and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency
    forward and option contracts used in our international

business-to-business

payments operations. The impact of these contracts is classified
    within foreign exchange revenues in the consolidated statements
    of income.

Other income, net

—Other income, net is comprised
    primarily of equity earnings from equity method investments and
    other income and expenses.

Results
    of Operations

The following discussion of our consolidated results of
    operations and segment results refers to the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and
    the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same
    period in 2008. The results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of
    operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning
    certain components of the consolidated statements of income. All
    significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our
    Company’s segments have been eliminated.

We incurred expenses of $59.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 for restructuring and related activities,
    which have not been allocated to segments. No restructuring and
    related expenses were recognized in the corresponding period in
    2009 and we incurred expenses of $82.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. While these items are identifiable
    to our segments, they are not included in the measurement of
    segment operating profit provided to the chief operating
    decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on restructuring and
    related activities refer to “Operating expenses
    overview.”

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a
    $71.0 million settlement accrual, which was not allocated
    to the segments. While this item was identifiable to our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on the settlement
    accrual, refer to “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses.

Revenues
    overview

The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues
    were contributed by our

consumer-to-consumer

segment for all periods presented, which is discussed in greater
    detail in “Segment Discussion.”

    compared to 2009

Consolidated revenue increased 2% during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 due to

consumer-to-consumer

transaction growth and the acquisition of Custom House, which
    contributed $111.0 million to revenue in 2010 and
    $30.8 million in 2009. Transaction growth and incremental
    Custom House revenue were offset by price decreases, primarily
    related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business
    (transactions between and within the United States and Canada)
    commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, declines in our United
    States bill payments businesses, geographic and product mix,
    including a higher percentage of revenue earned from
    intra-country activity, which has a lower revenue per
    transaction, and the strengthening of the United States dollar
    compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively
    impacted revenue.

The Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia
    (“EMEASA”) region of our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which represented 44% of our total consolidated revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced flat



revenue despite transaction growth. Transaction growth was
    offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar in the
    region compared to most other foreign currencies, which
    negatively impacted revenue, and many of the same factors
    described above.

The Americas region (including North America, Latin America, the
    Caribbean and South America) of our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which represented 31% of our total consolidated revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced revenue
    increases due to strong transaction growth, although the
    increase was mostly offset by the impact of pricing actions
    taken in our domestic business in the fourth quarter of 2009.

The global business payments segment, which is discussed in
    greater detail in “Segment Discussion,” also
    experienced revenue growth during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to our
    acquisition of Custom House, which was partially offset by
    declines in our United States bill payments businesses.

Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 over 2009 primarily due to foreign
    exchange revenues contributed from our acquisition of Custom
    House. In addition to the impact of Custom House, foreign
    exchange revenues in the

consumer-to-consumer

segment also grew, driven primarily by revenue from the
    international business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have
    resulted in a reduction of transaction fee and foreign exchange
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 of
    $36.8 million over the previous year, net of foreign
    currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been
    constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the
    EMEASA region.

    compared to 2008

Consolidated revenue declined 4% during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The revenue decline was attributable to
    the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth, and to a
    lesser extent, geographic mix, product mix including a higher
    percentage of revenue earned from intra-country activity, which
    has lower revenue per transaction than cross-border
    transactions, and price decreases. Also impacting the revenue
    decline was the strengthening of the United States dollar
    compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of
    the year, which adversely impacted revenue by approximately 3%,
    as discussed below.

The EMEASA region of our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which represented 45% of our total consolidated revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue
    declines and slower transaction growth rates during the year
    ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding
    period in the prior year. The revenue declines were driven by
    most of the same factors discussed above. The acquisition of
    FEXCO’s money transfer business did not have an impact on
    our revenue as we were already recognizing 100% of the revenue
    arising from money transfers originating at FEXCO’s
    locations.

The Americas region of our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, which represented 32% of our total consolidated revenue
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue
    and transaction declines due to the overall weak United States
    economy. Our Americas results were further impacted by pricing
    reductions taken in the United States in the fourth quarter of
    2009 which improved our transaction volumes, but contributed to
    the decline in revenue.

The global business payments segment, which is discussed in
    greater detail in “Segment Discussion,” also
    experienced revenue declines during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding prior
    period. Revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic
    situation in the United States, which resulted in a revenue
    decline in our United States cash and electronic bill payments
    businesses. Offsetting these declines in 2009 were the results
    of our Custom House acquisition, which contributed
    $30.8 million of revenue for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 over 2008 primarily due to foreign
    exchange revenues from Business Solutions. Excluding the impact
    of Business Solutions, foreign exchange revenues decreased at a
    rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from
    our international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have
    resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange
    revenue for the year ended December 31,



2009 of $119.5 million over the previous year, net of
    foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there
    been constant currency rates. The impact to earnings per share
    during the period was less than the revenue impact due to the
    translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging
    program. The majority of our foreign currency exchange rate
    exposure is related to the EMEASA region.

Operating
    expenses overview

The following factors impacted both cost of services and
    selling, general and administrative expenses during the periods
    presented:

•

Restructuring and Related Activities—

On May 25,
    2010 and as subsequently revised, our Board of Directors
    approved a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring
    Plan”) designed to reduce our overall headcount and migrate
    positions from various facilities, primarily within the United
    States and Europe, to regional operating centers upon completion
    of the Restructuring Plan. In conjunction with this decision and
    subsequent revisions, we expect to incur approximately
    $50 million in additional expenses in 2011 related to the
    Restructuring Plan. The total expense for 2010 and 2011 of
    approximately $110 million consists of approximately
    $80 million for severance and employee related benefits,
    approximately $10 million for facility closures, including
    lease terminations; and approximately $20 million for other
    expenses. Included in these estimated expenses are approximately
    $2 million of non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and
    leasehold improvement write-offs and accelerated depreciation at
    impacted facilities. Subject to complying with and undertaking
    the necessary individual and collective employee information and
    consultation obligations as may be required by local law for
    potentially affected employees, we expect all of these
    activities to be completed by the third quarter of 2011. Total
    cost savings of approximately $8 million were generated in
    2010 and approximately $50 million is expected to be
    generated in 2011. Cost savings of approximately
    $70 million per year are expected to be generated beginning
    in 2012, following completion of the Restructuring Plan.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, restructuring and
    related expenses of $15.0 million are classified within
    “cost of services” and $44.5 million are
    classified within “selling, general and
    administrative” in the consolidated statements of income.
    No restructuring and related expenses were recognized in 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, restructuring and
    related expenses of $62.8 million and $20.1 million
    are classified within “cost of services” and
    “selling, general and administrative” expenses,
    respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. These
    restructuring and related expenses are associated with the
    closure of our facilities in Missouri and Texas and other
    reorganization plans executed in 2008. No expenses were
    recognized for these restructurings in 2009.

Cost of
    services

Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31,
    2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to incremental
    costs, including those related to Custom House, our money order
    business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives,
    including our web and account based money transfer services;
    agent commissions, which primarily increase in relation to
    revenue increases; and restructuring and related expenses of
    $15.0 million, offset by operating efficiencies, primarily
    decreased bad debt expense. Cost of services as a percentage of
    revenue was 57% for both of the years ended December 31,
    2010 and 2009 as incremental operating costs, including costs
    associated with our money order business and advancing our
    electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account
    based money transfer services, and restructuring and related
    expenses were offset by operating efficiencies, primarily
    decreased bad debt expense.

Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31,
    2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008 primarily due
    to agent commissions, which decreased due to revenue declines,
    as well as reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of
    FEXCO and other selective

consumer-to-consumer

commission initiatives. Also impacting cost of services was the
    strengthening of the United States dollar for most of 2009
    compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a
    favorable impact on the translation of our expenses, and
    restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009
    and the related 2009 cost savings. These costs were offset by
    incremental operating costs, including increased technology
    costs and costs associated with Custom House. Cost of



services as a percentage of revenue was 57% and 59% for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding
    period in 2008 was generally due to reduced commissions
    resulting from the acquisition of FEXCO and selective

consumer-to-consumer

agent commission initiatives, restructuring costs incurred in
    2008 which did not recur in 2009 and the related 2009 cost
    savings, offset somewhat by incremental operating costs,
    including increased technology costs and costs associated with
    Custom House.

Selling,
    general and administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses
    (“SG&A”) decreased for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior
    year due to the settlement accrual that was recorded in 2009, as
    described below, lower marketing expenses and operating
    efficiencies, offset by incremental costs associated with Custom
    House and our retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment
    Services Directive, restructuring and related expenses of
    $44.5 million and higher employee compensation costs.

SG&A increased for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to the same period in the prior year due to the
    settlement accrual described below, incremental costs associated
    with the acquisitions of FEXCO and Custom House including costs
    related to evaluating and closing these acquisitions and other
    increased operating expenses, offset by better leveraging of our
    marketing expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in 2008
    which did not recur in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an
    accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement
    with the State of Arizona and other states. On February 11,
    2010, we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved
    all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and
    requires us to fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico will participate with Arizona. The accrual includes
    amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs
    associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the
    agreement and settlement, we expect to make certain investments
    in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico
    border and have engaged a monitor for those programs, which are
    expected to cost up to $23 million over the period from
    signing to 2013.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    marketing related expenditures, principally classified within
    SG&A, were approximately 4%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of
    revenue. Marketing related expenditures include advertising,
    events, loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to
    marketing activities. When making decisions with respect to
    marketing investments, we review opportunities for advertising
    and other marketing related expenditures together with
    opportunities for fee adjustments, as discussed in “Segment
    Discussion,” for

consumer-to-consumer

revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the
    return on these investments.

Total
    other expense, net

Total other expense, net increased during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an
    increase in interest expense resulting from our
    $250 million note issuance and financing costs incurred in
    connection with our note exchange, and a decrease in interest
    income due to lower short-term interest rates and the repayment
    of a note receivable due from an agent. These amounts were
    partially offset by the recovery of $6.3 million of the
    $12 million reserve recorded in the prior year against our
    receivable from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund due to
    the final settlement.

Total other expense, net increased during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in
    interest income primarily due to lower short-term interest rates
    and lower average interest-bearing cash balances, the reserve
    taken against our receivable from the Reserve International
    Liquidity Fund, Ltd. mentioned above and a decline in earnings
    on our equity method investments in 2009, primarily as a result
    of the absence of equity method earnings for FEXCO subsequent to
    the February 2009 acquisition date.

Income
    taxes

Our effective tax rates on pre-tax income were 20.5%, 25.0% and
    25.8% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. We continue to benefit from an increasing
    proportion of profits being foreign-derived,



and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and
    state tax rates in the United States. In addition, during 2010,
    we have also benefitted from cumulative and ongoing tax planning
    benefits, including benefits related to certain previous foreign
    acquisitions, and from certain IRS settlements related to 2002
    through 2004.

We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax
    exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with
    respect to our international operations restructured in 2003. As
    of December 31, 2010, the total amount of tax contingency
    reserves was $607.9 million, including accrued interest and
    penalties, net of related benefits. Our reserves reflect our
    judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject
    to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are
    adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no
    assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax
    authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not
    exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our
    income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax
    reserves arising from material changes during the period in
    facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax
    issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as
    recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of
    a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially
    increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated
    financial statements in future periods and could impact our
    operating cash flows.

The IRS completed its examination of the United States federal
    consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004,
    of which we are a part, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in
    December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency alleges significant
    additional taxes, interest and penalties owed with respect to a
    variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries, and we
    generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these
    potential Western Union-related adjustments under the tax
    allocation agreement with First Data executed at the time of the
    spin-off. We agree with a number of the adjustments in the
    Notice of Deficiency; however, we do not agree with the Notice
    of Deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments
    representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of
    approximately $114 million. As of December 31, 2010,
    interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments
    would be approximately $36 million. A substantial part of
    the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates
    to our international restructuring, which took effect in the
    fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the alleged amounts due
    related to such restructuring largely are attributable to 2004.
    On March 20, 2009, we filed a petition in the United States
    Tax Court contesting those adjustments with which we do not
    agree. In September 2010, IRS Counsel referred the case to the
    IRS Appeals Division for possible settlement. We believe our
    overall reserves are adequate, including those associated with
    adjustments alleged in the Notice of Deficiency. If the
    IRS’ position in the Notice of Deficiency is sustained, our
    tax provision related to 2003 and later years would materially
    increase, which could materially impact our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

In 2010, we made a $250 million refundable tax deposit
    relating to potential United States federal tax liabilities,
    including those arising from our 2003 international
    restructuring, which have been previously accrued in our
    financial statements. Making the deposit limits the further
    accrual of interest charges with respect to such potential tax
    liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. The $250 million
    refundable tax deposit is recorded as a reduction to
    “Income taxes payable” in the consolidated balance
    sheets as of December 31, 2010.

Earnings
    per share

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    basic earnings per share were $1.37, $1.21 and $1.26,
    respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.36, $1.21
    and $1.24, respectively. Unvested shares of restricted stock are
    excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
    share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
    outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised
    and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were
    34.0 million, 37.5 million and 8.0 million,
    respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of
    Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share
    calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was
    anti-dilutive. The increase in anti-dilutive shares in 2010 and
    2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the majority of our
    outstanding options having an exercise price higher than our
    average market price for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009.

Of the 37.5 million, 42.8 million and
    43.6 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our
    common stock as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, approximately 35%, 40% and 47%, respectively, were
    held by employees of First Data.



Earnings per share increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the corresponding previous
    period as a result of the previously described factors impacting
    net income and lower weighted-average shares outstanding.
    Earnings per share decreased for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of the
    previously described factors impacting net income, offset by
    lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. The lower
    number of shares outstanding was due to stock repurchases
    exceeding stock option exercises in both 2010 and 2009 compared
    to the corresponding periods in the prior years.

Segment
    Discussion

We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we
    serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two
    segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups,
    distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments. Businesses not considered part of
    these segments are categorized as “Other.”

The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by,
    our CODM are computed in accordance with the following
    principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments
    primarily based on a percentage of the segments’ revenue
    compared to total revenue.

•

Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions
    are included in “Other.”

•

We incurred expenses of $59.5 million and
    $82.9 million for restructuring and related activities for
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, respectively,
    which were not allocated to segments. No expenses were
    recognized for restructurings and related activities in 2009.
    While these items were identifiable to our segments, they were
    not included in the measurement of segment operating profit
    provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment
    performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on restructuring and
    related activities refer to “Operating expenses
    overview.”

•

During 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million
    resulting from the multi-state agreement and settlement, which
    was not allocated to the segments. While this item was
    identifiable to our

consumer-to-consumer

segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on the settlement
    accrual, refer to “Operating expenses overview.”

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded.

The following table sets forth the components of segment
    revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

In determining the revenue and transaction growth rates under
    the regional view in the above table, the geographic split is
    determined based upon the region where the money transfer is
    initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For
    transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split
    the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with
    each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and
    paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions
    are attributed to that region.

When referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for
    individual countries in the following discussion, all
    transactions to, from and within those countries, and 100% of
    the revenue associated with each transaction to, from and within
    those countries are included. The countries of India and China
    combined represented approximately 7%, 7% and 6% of our
    consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No individual country, other
    than the United States, represented more than approximately 6%,
    6% and 7% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Transaction
    fees and foreign exchange revenues

    compared to 2009

For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior
    year,

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer revenue grew 2% primarily due to transaction
    growth of 9%. Transaction growth was offset by price decreases,
    primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic
    business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, geographic
    and product mix, including a higher percentage of revenue earned
    from intra-country activity, and the strengthening of the United
    States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which
    negatively impacted revenue by approximately 1%. Our
    international

consumer-to-consumer

business experienced revenue growth of 3% on transaction growth
    of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our
    international business represents all transactions other than
    transactions between and within the United States and Canada and
    transactions to and from Mexico. Our international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States also experienced revenue
    growth on transaction increases for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Revenue in our EMEASA region remained flat during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year despite
    transaction growth of 5%. Transaction growth was offset by the
    strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other
    foreign currencies in the region and many of the same factors
    described above. Our European market experienced transaction
    growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to
    the prior year. In addition, for the full year ended
    December 31, 2010, revenue and transactions in the Gulf
    States declined moderately compared to the same period in 2009,
    however, both revenue and transactions grew in the fourth
    quarter of 2010 compared to the comparable period in the prior
    year. India had transaction growth of 4% and revenue growth of
    5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the same
    period in 2009.

Americas revenue increased 2% on transaction growth of 11% for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year
    due to the pricing actions taken in the domestic business
    commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our domestic business
    experienced revenue declines of 6% on transaction growth of 28%
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the same
    factors. However, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our domestic
    business experienced revenue growth of 7% on transaction growth
    of 29% as we reached the anniversary of the pricing reductions
    taken in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our United States outbound
    business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the
    year ended December 31, 2010. Our Mexico business revenue
    was flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 on
    transaction growth of 2%.

APAC revenue increased 13% for the year ended December 31,
    2010 compared to the prior year due to transaction growth of
    14%. China’s revenue increased 10% on transaction growth of
    7% for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2010 grew compared to the prior year, driven primarily by
    revenue from our international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have
    resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of
    $32.3 million over the same period in the previous year,
    net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had
    there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was
    related to the EMEASA region.

We have historically implemented and will likely implement
    future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign
    exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account a
    variety of factors. Fee decreases and foreign exchange actions
    generally can reduce margins in the short term, but are done in
    anticipation that they will result in increased transaction
    volumes and increased revenues over time. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, such fee decreases and foreign exchange
    actions were approximately 4% of our total revenue compared to
    2% and 1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. For the full year 2010, approximately
    three-fourths of these actions relate to pricing reductions
    taken in the domestic business.

The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature
    agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only
    marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation.
    Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location,
    is often experienced as locations mature. We believe that new
    agent locations will help



drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to
    send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with
    more than 50% of transactions being initiated (versus paid) as
    “send locations” and to the balance of locations as
    “receive locations.” Send locations are the engine
    that drives

consumer-to-consumer

revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than
    receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations
    is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global
    distribution and convenience for consumers. The number of send
    and receive transactions at an agent location can vary
    significantly due to such factors as customer demographics
    around the location, migration patterns, the location’s
    class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location
    has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and
    competition. Each of the more than 445,000 agent locations in
    our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our
    services; however, not every location completes a transaction in
    a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2010, more
    than 85% of agent locations in the United States, Canada and
    Western Europe (representing at least one of our three money
    transfer brands: Western
    Union

,

    Orlandi

and

)

    experienced money transfer activity in the previous
    12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other
    areas where there are primarily receive locations, approximately
    70% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the
    previous 12 months. We periodically review locations to
    determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer
    transactions.

    compared to 2008

Consumer-to-consumer

money transfer revenue declined 4% on transaction growth of 4%
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008. The revenue
    decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing
    transaction growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix,
    product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from
    intra-country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction
    than cross-border transactions, and price decreases. Also
    impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the
    United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies
    for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue
    by approximately 2%, as discussed below. Our international

consumer-to-consumer

business experienced a revenue decline of 1% on transaction
    growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our
    international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States also experienced revenue
    declines on transaction increases for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 as a result of the same factors described
    above.

Revenue in our EMEASA region declined 1% during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due
    to most of the same factors discussed above. Our largest
    European markets experienced revenue declines during most of the
    year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period
    in 2008. Our money transfer business to India for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 versus the same period in 2008 continued
    to grow with transaction growth of 22% and revenue growth of
    11%. Revenue and transaction growth for both India and the Gulf
    States slowed throughout the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to 2008. Due to the economic conditions in the Gulf
    States, transaction growth rates declined to single digits in
    the fourth quarter.

Americas revenue and transactions declined for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.
    Contributing to the overall decline in the Americas region was
    the domestic business which experienced a revenue decline of 14%
    on a transaction decline of 5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The repositioning of the domestic
    business, including pricing reductions taken in the United
    States in the fourth quarter of 2009, improved our Americas and
    domestic transaction volumes, but contributed to the decline in
    revenue. Our Mexico business also contributed to the overall
    decline in the Americas region with a revenue decline of 15% on
    a transaction decline of 12% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Our United States domestic and Mexico
    business revenue declined due to the weak economy in the United
    States. Our Mexico revenues were also impacted by our closure of
    certain Vigo branded agents, substantially all of which were
    small retailers, due to credit concerns. However, the decline in
    revenue for our United States outbound business moderated in the
    fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the previous nine months of
    2009 as a result of transaction growth experienced in the fourth
    quarter of 2009.

Our APAC revenue increased 5% on transaction growth of 18% for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same
    period in 2008. The APAC region’s revenues have been
    impacted by translating foreign currency denominated revenues
    into the United States dollar, as further described below, as
    well as moderating transaction growth. China revenue grew 1% on
    4% transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2009.



Foreign exchange revenues decreased for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 over the corresponding previous period at
    a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue
    from our international

consumer-to-consumer

business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States
    dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have
    resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 of
    $101.3 million over the same period in the previous year,
    net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had
    there been constant currency rates.

Operating
    income

    compared to 2009

Consumer-to-consumer

operating income increased 6% during the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due
    to lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies,
    primarily decreased bad debt expense, offset by higher employee
    compensation costs and incremental costs associated with our
    retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment Services
    Directive. The increase in operating income margin for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the
    prior year resulted from these same factors.

    compared to 2008

Consumer-to-consumer

operating income decreased 4% during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the decline in
    revenue, incremental costs, including increased technology costs
    and the acquisition of FEXCO, offset somewhat by reduced agent
    commissions, savings realized from the 2008 restructurings and
    better leveraging of our marketing expenses, as described
    earlier. The operating income margin for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was consistent with 2008.

Revenues

    compared to 2009

During the year ended December 31, 2010, global business
    payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our
    acquisition of Custom House, which contributed
    $111.0 million of revenue in 2010 versus $30.8 million
    in 2009, primarily included in foreign exchange revenues, and
    growth in the Pago Fácil business. These increases were
    offset by revenue declines in our United States bill payments
    businesses as many United States consumers who would use our
    services continue to have difficulty paying their bills and
    continue to be unable to obtain credit in any form, resulting in
    us handling fewer bill payments. The ongoing trend away from
    cash based bill payments in the



United States and competitive pressures, which resulted in lower
    cash and electronic volumes and a shift to lower revenue per
    transaction products, also contributed to the revenue declines.

The transaction declines during the year ended December 31,
    2010 compared to the same period in 2009 were due to declines in
    our United States bill payments businesses.

    compared to 2008

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the global
    business payments segment revenue was adversely impacted by the
    weak economic situation in the United States, which resulted in
    a revenue decline in our United States cash and electronic bill
    payments businesses, partially offset by $30.8 million in
    revenue generated from our September 1, 2009 acquisition of
    Custom House and slight growth in the Pago Fácil business.
    The segment’s revenues were primarily generated in the
    United States for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to 2008 was driven by our Pago Fácil cash-based
    and United States electronic-based bill payments businesses.
    Both of these businesses carry a lower revenue per transaction
    than our United States cash-based bill payment business. The
    transaction growth was offset by a decline in the United States
    cash-based bill payments business.

Operating
    income

    compared to 2009

For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating income
    decreased compared to the same period in the prior year
    primarily due to declines related to the United States-based
    bill payments business, and investing and operating costs,
    including amortization expense, associated with the acquisition
    of Custom House.

The decline in operating income margin in the segment is
    primarily due to the increased costs associated with the
    acquisition of Custom House and declines in our United States
    bill payments businesses.

    compared to 2008

For the year ended December 31, 2009, operating income
    decreased compared to the same period in the prior year
    primarily due to operating income declines related to the United
    States-based bill payments business and operating and
    integration costs associated with the acquisition of Custom
    House, offset slightly by the savings generated from the 2008
    restructurings.

The decline in operating income margin in the segment is due to
    the factors described above and continues to be impacted by the
    decline in the United States cash-based bill payments business
    which has a higher operating income margin than our South
    America and electronic businesses.

Revenues

    compared to 2009

Revenue, generated primarily from our money order services
    business, declined for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to the same period in the prior year. We experienced a
    decrease in the amount of revenue earned



related to our money order services business as we no longer
    receive a fixed return of 5.5% from IPS on outstanding money
    order balances as we did for the first three quarters of 2009.
    We now derive investment income from interest generated on our
    money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in
    United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities.
    These securities generally have a lower rate of return than we
    were receiving under our previous agreement with IPS. In 2008,
    we entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our fixed rate
    notes to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
    Through a combination of the revenue generated from the new
    investment securities and the anticipated interest expense
    savings resulting from the interest rate swaps, we estimate that
    we should be able to retain a materially comparable after-tax
    rate of return through 2011 as we had been receiving under the
    agreement with IPS.

    compared to 2008

Revenue remained relatively consistent with prior year and is
    comprised primarily of our money order services business. In the
    fourth quarter of 2009, we experienced a decrease in the amount
    of revenue earned related to our money order services business
    due to the change in our agreement with IPS described above.

Operating
    income

    compared to 2009

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the decrease in
    operating income was due to the decrease in revenue from our
    money order services business, as described above, and an
    increase in promotional marketing activities related to our
    prepaid business in the United States. In 2009, we also incurred
    additional costs associated with evaluating and closing
    acquisitions compared to 2010.

    compared to 2008

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the decrease in
    operating income was primarily due to increased costs related to
    acquisitions and a decline in our money order services business
    due to the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 as
    described above.

Further financial information relating to each of our
    segments’ external revenue, operating profit measures and
    total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated
    financial statements.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our
    operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations
    in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the
    timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings,
    timing of income tax payments, including our refundable tax
    deposit described further in “Cash Flows from Operating
    Activities” and collections on receivables, among other
    items. The majority of our interest payments are due in the
    second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the
    amount of cash provided by operating activities in those
    quarters, and a corresponding increase to the first and third
    quarters.

Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors,
    some of which are out of our control, including changes in
    economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant
    population, and changes in income tax laws or the status of
    income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax
    matters.

A significant portion of our cash flows from operating
    activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which
    are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all
    excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use,
    except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions.
    The assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions of
    approximately $210 million include those located in
    countries outside of the United States containing restrictions
    from being transferred outside of those countries and cash and
    investment balances that are maintained by a regulated
    subsidiary to secure certain money transfer obligations
    initiated in the United States in accordance with applicable
    state regulations. Significant changes in the regulatory
    environment for money transmitters could impact our primary
    source of liquidity.



We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business
    needs, including the pending acquisition of Angelo Costa S.r.l.,
    dividends, and share repurchases, through our existing cash
    balances and our ability to generate cash flows through
    operations. In addition, we have capacity to borrow up to
    $1.5 billion in the aggregate under our commercial paper
    program and revolving credit facility, which were not drawn on
    as of and during the year ended December 31, 2010. The
    revolving credit facility expires in September 2012.

Cash
    and Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion was held by our
    foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund
    our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash
    balances to fluctuate.

Repatriating foreign funds to the United States would, in many
    cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of
    these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates
    compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the
    United States. We expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund
    our international operations and to acquire businesses
    internationally.

In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain
    other payment services before we settle the payment of those
    transactions. These funds, referred to as “settlement
    assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, are not used to
    support our operations. However, we earn income from investing
    these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in
    highly liquid investments, classified as “cash and cash
    equivalents” within “settlement assets,” to fund
    settlement obligations.

Investment securities, classified within settlement assets, were
    $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. Substantially
    all of these investments are state and municipal debt
    securities. Most state regulators in the United States require
    us to maintain specific high-quality, investment grade
    securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant
    outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable
    regulations. Substantially all of our investment securities in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at fair value. Under the Payment Services Directive
    (“PSD”) in the European Union, we expect to have a
    similar portfolio of investment securities, which we will manage
    in a similar manner and under similar guidelines as our current
    portfolio.

Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes
    in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit
    risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality
    investments, including diversifying our investment portfolio. As
    of December 31, 2010, the majority of our investment
    securities had credit ratings of “AA-” or better from
    a major credit rating agency. Our investment securities are also
    actively managed with respect to concentration. As of
    December 31, 2010, all investments with a single issuer and
    each individual security was less than 10% of our investment
    securities portfolio.

Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    cash provided by operating activities was $994.4 million,
    $1,218.1 million and $1,253.9 million, respectively.
    Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from 2009
    to 2010, primarily due to a $250.0 million refundable tax
    deposit made relating to potential United States federal tax
    liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international
    restructuring, which have been previously accrued in our
    financial statements. Making the deposit limits the further
    accrual of interest charges with respect to such potential tax
    liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. Cash flows provided
    by operating activities decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to lower
    net income, offset by working capital fluctuations in 2009,
    including the settlement accrual and timing of tax payments.

Commercial
    Paper

Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured
    commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed
    $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent
    of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our
    commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to
    397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for
    borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. We
    had no commercial paper borrowings as of and during the year
    ended December 31, 2010.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

Our revolving credit facility expires in September 2012 and
    includes a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a
    $250.0 million letter of credit

sub-facility

and a $150.0 million swing line

sub-facility

(the “Revolving Credit Facility”).



Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for
    the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms
    of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a
    selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of
    19 basis points. A facility fee of 6 basis points on
    the total facility is payable quarterly regardless of usage. The
    facility fee percentage is determined based on certain of our
    credit ratings. In addition, to the extent the aggregate
    outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility
    exceed 50% of the related aggregate commitments, a utilization
    fee of 5 basis points as of December 31, 2010 based
    upon such ratings is payable to the lenders on the aggregate
    outstanding borrowings. The interest rate margin, facility fee
    and utilization fee are all based on certain of our credit
    ratings.

As of and during the year ended December 31, 2010, we had
    no outstanding borrowings on this facility and had
    $1.5 billion available to borrow. Our revolving credit
    facility, which is diversified through a group of 15
    participating institutions, is used to provide general liquidity
    for us and to support our commercial paper program, which we
    believe enhances our short term credit rating. The largest
    commitment from any single financial institution within the
    total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately
    20%. The substantial majority of the banks within this group
    were rated at least an “A−” or better as of
    December 31, 2010. If the amount available to borrow under
    the revolving credit facility decreased, or if the revolving
    credit facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of
    borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.

Notes

On June 21, 2010, we issued $250 million of aggregate
    principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040.
    Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semiannually
    on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per
    annum interest rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price
    based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.

On March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of
    aggregate principal amount of our 2011 Notes for unsecured notes
    due April 1, 2020. Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes
    is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based
    on the fixed per annum interest rate of 5.253%. In connection
    with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium
    ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the
    exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was
    accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not
    charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the
    offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be accreted into
    interest expense over the life of the notes. We may redeem the
    2020 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par
    or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus
    15 basis points.

On February 26, 2009, we issued $500 million of
    aggregate principal amount of our 2014 Notes. Interest with
    respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semiannually on February 26
    and August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum interest
    rate of 6.500%. We may redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior
    to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the
    applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points.

On November 17, 2006, we issued $1 billion aggregate
    principal amount of 5.400% Notes due 2011 and
    $500 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.200% Notes due 2036 (the “2036 Notes”).
    Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is
    payable semiannually on May 17 and November 17 each year based
    on fixed per annum interest rates of 5.400% and 6.200%,
    respectively. We may redeem the 2011 Notes and the 2036 Notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price
    based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points
    and 25 basis points, respectively.

On September 29, 2006, we issued $1 billion of
    aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on
    October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable
    semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on a fixed
    per annum interest rate of 5.930%. We may redeem the 2016 Notes
    at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price
    based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points.

Credit
    Ratings and Debt Covenants

The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in
    managing our financing costs and facilitating access to
    additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe
    are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings,
    cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and overall
    business risks.



Our Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest rate margin,
    facility fee and utilization fee, all of which are determined
    based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, we are
    subject to certain provisions in our 2014 Notes, 2040 Notes and
    certain of our derivative contracts which would require
    settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in
    control combined with a downgrade below investment grade. We do
    not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other
    contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings. The
    table below summarizes our credit ratings as of
    December 31, 2010:

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any
    of our securities. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision
    or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization,
    and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
    rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for
    any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or
    withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment,
    circumstances so warrant. A downgrade or a negative outlook
    provided by the rating agencies could result in the following:

•

Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if
    we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the
    commercial paper market would likely be eliminated;

•

We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future
    financings;

•

Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease;

•

Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements
    on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our
    regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends; and

•

Our agent relationships may be adversely impacted, particularly
    those agents that are financial institutions or post offices.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants which, among
    other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer
    assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another
    company, grant certain types of security interests, incur
    certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary
    dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur
    certain subsidiary level indebtedness. Our notes are subject to
    similar covenants except that only the 2011 Notes, 2016 Notes,
    2020 Notes and the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or
    restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are
    subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose
    restrictions on subsidiary dividends. In addition, the Revolving
    Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted
    EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of
    consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum
    of (a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense,
    (c) depreciation expense, (d) amortization expense,
    (e) any other non-cash deductions, losses or changes made
    in determining net income for such period and
    (f) extraordinary losses or charges, minus extraordinary
    gains, in each case determined in accordance with United States
    GAAP for such period, to interest expense) for each period
    comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our
    consolidated interest coverage ratio was 9:1 for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with our
    debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair
    our ability to borrow, and outstanding amounts borrowed could
    become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess
    cash for other purposes.

Cash
    Priorities

Liquidity

Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital
    structure consistent with our current credit ratings. We have
    existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities,
    access to the commercial paper markets and our $1.5 billion
    revolving credit facility available to support the needs of our
    business.



Capital
    Expenditures

The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of
    property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was
    $113.7 million, $98.9 million and $153.7 million
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amounts paid for new and
    renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing
    contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract
    signings. Other capital expenditures during 2010, 2009 and 2008
    included investments in our information technology
    infrastructure and purchased and developed software.

Acquisition
    of Businesses

In December 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire the
    remaining 70% interest which we currently do not own in Angelo
    Costa S.r.l. (“Costa”), one of our largest money
    transfer agents in Europe. We will acquire the 70% interest for
    cash of €100 million (approximately $133 million
    based on currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010),
    less a working capital deficiency adjustment to be determined at
    closing. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half
    of 2011, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of
    closing conditions.

On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada-based Custom
    House, a provider of international

business-to-business

payment services, for cash consideration of $371.0 million
    for all of the common shares of this business and acquired cash
    of $2.5 million.

On February 24, 2009, we acquired the money transfer
    business of European-based FEXCO Group Holdings (“FEXCO
    Group”), one of our largest agents providing services in a
    number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom,
    Spain, Sweden and Ireland. We surrendered our 24.65% interest in
    FEXCO Group and paid €123.1 million
    ($157.4 million) as consideration for all of the common
    shares of the money transfer business and acquired cash of
    $11.8 million.

In December 2008, we acquired 80% of our existing money transfer
    agent in Peru for a purchase price of $35.0 million. The
    aggregate consideration paid was $29.7 million, net of a
    holdback reserve of $3.0 million and cash acquired of
    $2.3 million.

On August 1, 2008, we acquired the money transfer assets
    from our existing money transfer agent in Panama for a purchase
    price of $18.3 million, which is net of cash acquired. The
    consideration paid was $14.3 million, net of a holdback
    reserve of $4.0 million.

We expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to
    acquire companies, particularly outside of the United States, to
    further complement and strengthen our existing businesses
    worldwide.

Share
    Repurchases and Dividends

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    35.6 million, 24.8 million and 58.1 million,
    respectively, of shares were repurchased for
    $584.5 million, $400.0 million and
    $1,313.9 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at
    an average cost of $16.44, $16.10 and $22.60 per share,
    respectively. At December 31, 2010, $415.5 million
    remains available under share repurchase authorizations approved
    by our Board of Directors. On February 1, 2011, the Board
    of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion of common
    stock repurchases through December 31, 2012.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Board of
    Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common
    share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per common share in each
    of the first three quarters representing $165.3 million in
    total dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of
    Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share
    representing $41.2 million in total dividends. During the
    fourth quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors declared an
    annual cash dividend of $0.04 per common share representing
    $28.4 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid
    to shareholders of record in the respective month the dividend
    was declared, except for the September 2010 declared dividend,
    which was paid in October 2010.

Debt
    Service Requirements

Our 2011 debt service requirements will include
    $696.3 million of our 5.400% notes maturing in
    November 2011, payments on future borrowings under our
    commercial paper program, if any, and interest payments on all



outstanding indebtedness. However, as market conditions allow,
    we may refinance all or a portion of the 2011 Notes with new
    financing sources. We have the ability to use existing financing
    sources, including our cash, Revolving Credit Facility and
    commercial paper program, to meet obligations as they arise.
    Based on market conditions at the time such refinancing could
    occur, we may not be able to obtain new financing under similar
    conditions as historically reported.

Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions,
    return capital to shareholders, including share repurchases and
    dividends, and service our debt will depend on our ability to
    continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating
    subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those
    operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing
    and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that
    will align with our long-term strategy.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed
    in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, we
    have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
    reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on
    our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
    operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Pension
    Plan

On December 31, 2010, we merged our two frozen defined
    benefit pension plans into one Plan (the “Plan”). The
    Plan assets were held in a master trust and were identical in
    terms of their benefit entitlements and other provisions (except
    for participant eligibility requirements) and consequently, the
    financial effect of the merger was not significant.

Our Plan had a recorded unfunded pension obligation of
    $112.8 million as of December 31, 2010. In 2010 we
    made approximately $25 million in contributions to the
    Plan, including a discretionary contribution of
    $10 million. Due to the closure of one of our facilities in
    Missouri and an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty
    Corporation, we funded $4.1 million during 2009. No
    contributions were made to the Plan during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. We will be required to fund
    approximately $22 million to the Plan in 2011 and may make
    a discretionary contribution of up to approximately
    $3 million.

Our most recent measurement date for our pension plans was
    December 31, 2010. The calculation of the funded status and
    net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary
    assumptions: 1) expected long-term return on plan assets;
    and 2) discount rate.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term
    rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied
    and long-term historical relationships between equities and
    fixed income securities are considered consistent with the
    widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher
    volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current
    market factors such as inflation and interest rates are
    evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
    determined. Consideration is given to diversification,
    re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities
    held. Historical returns are reviewed to check for
    reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate
    against a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated
    value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a
    five-year period. Our expected long-term return on plan assets
    was 6.50% for 2010 and 7.50% for 2009. The expected long-term
    return on plan assets is 7.00% for 2011. In early 2011 we
    revised our target asset allocation to approximately 15% in
    equity investments, 60% in fixed income securities and 25% in
    alternative investment strategies in order to increase
    diversification.

The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which
    the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount
    rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of
    anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot
    rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying
    maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit
    obligation was 4.69% and 5.30% at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the
    discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets would
    not have a material impact to our annual pension expense.

    includes certain additional investments in our compliance
    programs along the United States and Mexico border, which are
    expected to cost up to $19 million over the next three
    years pursuant to the agreement and settlement with the State of
    Arizona and other states.

Other
    Commercial Commitments

We had $85 million in outstanding letters of credit and
    bank guarantees at December 31, 2010, with expiration dates
    through 2015, the majority of which contain a one-year renewal
    option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily
    held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent
    agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank
    guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of
    operations and financial condition is based on our financial
    statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. The
    preparation of these financial statements requires that
    management make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and
    other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ
    from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are
    discussed in Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

, of the notes to consolidated financial statements,
    included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data

.

Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below,
    are very important to the portrayal of our financial position
    and our results of operations and applying them requires our
    management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
    We believe that the understanding of these key accounting
    policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight
    into our operating results and financial condition.

Income Taxes

Reinvestment of foreign earnings

Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial
    statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect
    to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our
    operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we
    believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required
    analyses and judgments.

With respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, we
    have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more
    favorable income tax rate than the combined United States
    federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest
    these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely.

At December 31, 2010, no provision had been made for United States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of approximately $2.5 billion, which are expected to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely.

Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the period such distribution occurred. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United States tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Income tax contingencies

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
    when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits
    of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon
    examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated
    financial statements from such a position are measured as the
    largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood
    of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax
    exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with
    respect to our international operations, which were restructured
    in 2003. Our tax reserves reflect management’s judgment as
    to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial
    review. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover
    reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that,
    in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be
    resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related
    reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense
    would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from
    material changes during the period in the facts and
    circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue
    and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the
    financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue
    during the period.

Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2010 were $607.9 million, including interest and penalties, net of related benefits. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates, particularly with respect to our 2003 restructuring of our international operations, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement signed in connection
    with the spin-off from First Data, we believe we have
    appropriately apportioned the taxes between First Data and us.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize derivatives to (a) minimize our exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency

business-to-business

payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.

Cash Flow hedges—Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted money transfer revenues and hedges of anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting t
he change in fair value of the hedged item. The portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in “Derivative (losses)/gains, net.”

Fair Value hedges—Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense.

The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements.

The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly.

If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively.

While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported results.

As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss from such cash flow hedges that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $31.8 million.

As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative debt adjustments from our fair value hedges that would be reflected in earnings if such hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was a $36.6 million gain.

Other Intangible Assets

We capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as well as acquired intangible assets and software.

We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounted cash flows) is required.

The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract.

The estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions including among other things revenue growth rates, and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans.

Disruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset.

If an event described above occurs and causes us to determine that an asset has been impaired, that could result in an impairment charge.

The net carrying value of our other intangible assets at December 31, 2010 was $438.0 million.

Goodwill Impairment Testing

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill, by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds i
ts implied fair value, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Reporting units are driven by the level at which segment management reviews operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment (e.g., Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer) and in others it is one level below the operating segment (e.g., Business Solutions, which is included in our global business payments segment).

We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected regulatory, marketplace and other economic factors.

The determination of the reporting units also requires judgment.

We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change.

If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the periods such charge occurs.

The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2010 was $2,151.7 million which represented approximately 27% of our consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2010, goodwill of $1,619.9 million and $264.3 million resides in our Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions reporting units, respectively.

For the Consumer-to-Consumer reporting unit, the fair value of the business greatly exceeds its ca
rrying amount that providing sensitivity is not meaningful. For the Business Solutions reporting unit, a decline in estimated fair value of up to 15% could occur before triggering an impairment of goodwill. A decline of 30% would trigger an impairment of approximately $55 million. We expect that such a fair value decline would be driven primarily by actual and forecasted revenues that do not meet expectations. We have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Acquisitions—Purchase Price

Allocation

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

For most acquisitions, we engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as agent networks, customer relationships, tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period of one year or less as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Purchase price allocation requires management to make
    assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of
    acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair
    value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash
    flows and replacement cost analysis.

During the last three years, we completed the following
    significant acquisitions:

•  In September 2009, we acquired Custom House
    for $371.0 million.

•  In February 2009, we acquired the money
    transfer business of FEXCO for $243.6 million.

See Note 4,

Acquisitions

, to the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, of this
    Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information related to the
    purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed during the
    last three years.

If estimates or assumptions used to complete the purchase price
    allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and
    liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made, the
    allocation of purchase price between goodwill and intangibles
    could significantly differ. Such a difference would impact
    future earnings through amortization expense of these
    intangibles. In addition, if forecasts supporting the valuation
    of the intangibles or goodwill are not achieved, impairments
    could arise, as discussed further in “Goodwill Impairment
    Testing” and “Other Intangible Assets” above. For
    all of our acquisitions during the three years ended December
    31, 2010, goodwill of $496.2 million and intangibles of $208.7
    million were recognized.

Restructuring and Related

Expenses

We have engaged in restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. We also evaluate impairment issues associated with restructuring activities.

Restructuring and related expenses consist of direct and incremental costs associated with restructuring and related activities, including severance, outplacement and other employee related benefits; facility closure and migration of IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and acceleration of depreciation.

These costs represent management’s best estimate, until all such amounts are paid and settled. As such, these costs require assumptions about the activities that may change over time.

The decision to include a cost in the restructuring disclosure requires an assessment of whether the cost is direct and incremental to the productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. This assessment can require judgment depending on the nature of the cost.

The timing of recording these costs was determined by the applicable accounting guidance. This judgment significantly impacted the timing of the recognition of restructuring and related expenses on a quarterly basis and between the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011.

The restructuring and related expenses are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring and related expenses could be materially impacted.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $59.5 million of restructuring and related expenses, of which $35.4 million remains unpaid. We expect to incur approximately $50 million in additional restructuring and related expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2011.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market
    rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents
    and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage
    these risks.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates

We provide

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer services in 200 countries and territories. We
    manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the
    business and an active risk management process. We settle with
    the vast majority of our agents in United States dollars or
    euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other
    currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local
    currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant
    on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid
    currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is
    limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid
    within 24 hours after they are initiated. To mitigate this
    risk further, we enter into short-term foreign currency forward
    contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one
    month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between
    transaction initiation and settlement. We also utilize foreign
    currency forward contracts, typically with terms of less than
    one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash
    positions and intercompany loans. In certain consumer money
    transfer and global business payments transactions involving
    different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based
    on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the
    customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to
    acquire currency, helping to provide protection against currency
    fluctuations. We promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as
    necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are
    denominated in foreign currencies.

We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to
    mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates on

consumer-to-consumer

revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and to a lesser
    degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies.
    We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at
    inception to mitigate some of the impact that changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with
    a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year.
    We believe the use of longer-term foreign currency forward
    contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our
    international

consumer-to-consumer

operations.

With the acquisition of Custom House in the third quarter of
    2009, our foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange
    risk management has increased due to the nature of this
    business. The significant majority of Custom House’s
    revenue, now known as Western Union Business Solutions
    (“Business Solutions”), is from exchanges of currency
    at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency
    payments. This business also writes foreign currency forward and
    option contracts for our customers to facilitate future
    payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is
    generally nine months or less. Our Business Solutions business
    aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer
    contracts, including the derivative contracts described above,
    and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into
    offsetting contracts with established financial institution
    counterparties. The foreign exchange risk is actively managed.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical uniform 10%
    strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States
    dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are
    generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre-tax
    annual income of approximately $32 million and
    $27 million, respectively, based on our forecast of
    unhedged exposure to foreign currency at those dates. There are
    inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due
    to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are
    linear and instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static,
    and that we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a
    result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects
    of more complex market changes that could arise, which may
    positively or negatively affect income.

Interest
    Rates

We invest in several types of interest bearing assets, with a
    total value at December 31, 2010 of $3.3 billion.
    Approximately $2.5 billion of these assets bear interest at
    floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in
    interest rates. These assets primarily include money market
    funds and state and municipal variable rate securities



and are included in our consolidated balance sheets within
    “cash and cash equivalents” and “settlement
    assets.” To the extent these assets are held in connection
    with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting
    redemption, they are classified as “settlement
    assets.” Earnings on these investments will increase and
    decrease with changes in the underlying short-term interest
    rates.

Substantially all of the remainder of our interest bearing
    assets consist of fixed rate instruments, the substantial
    majority of which are highly rated state and municipal debt
    securities. These investments may include investments made from
    cash received from our money transfer business and other related
    payment services awaiting redemption classified within
    “settlement assets” in the consolidated balance
    sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed
    rate interest-bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a
    decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the
    fair values of the securities. We have classified these
    investments as

available-for-sale

within “settlement assets” in the consolidated balance
    sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their
    fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the
    applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or
    deducted from our “total stockholders’ equity” on
    our consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2010, $1.2 billion of our total
    $3.3 billion in borrowings was effectively floating rate
    debt through interest rate swap agreements, changing our
    fixed-rate debt to LIBOR-based floating rate debt, with average
    spreads of approximately 500 basis points above LIBOR.
    Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a
    short period that the financing is effectively floating rate. No
    commercial paper borrowings were outstanding as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by
    evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also
    considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage
    this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to
    minimize risk, reduce costs, and optimize returns. Our exposure
    to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our
    interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of fixed
    versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily
    through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision
    regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus
    floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to
    increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market
    conditions. At December 31, 2010, our weighted-average
    interest rate on our borrowings outstanding, including our
    hedges, was approximately 5.2%.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in
    interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre-tax
    income of approximately $12 million and $8 million
    annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
    The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest
    rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 that are sensitive to interest
    rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting
    benefit/reduction to pre-tax income of approximately
    $25 million and $20 million annually, respectively.
    There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis
    presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate
    changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is
    unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market
    changes that could arise, including changes in credit risk
    regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively
    affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus
    floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and
    liabilities will change over time.

Credit
    Risk

Our interest earning assets include investment securities,
    substantially all of which are state and municipal debt
    securities, which are classified in “settlement
    assets” and accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities, and money market fund investments, which are
    classified in “cash and cash equivalents.” The
    majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of
    “AA-” or better from a major credit rating agency.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to
    investment securities, money market investments, derivatives and
    other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships
    with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review
    investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and
    credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments
    among global financial institutions. Since January 1, 2009,
    we also limit our investment level to no more than
    $100 million with respect to individual money market funds.



We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable
    balances from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment
    and money order settlement process. In addition, we are exposed
    to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly
    through our internet services and electronic channels, where
    transactions are originated through means other than cash, and
    therefore are subject to “chargebacks,” insufficient
    funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud. We perform
    a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic
    analyses. Our losses associated with bad debts have been less
    than 1% of our revenues in all periods presented.

We are also exposed to credit risk relating to derivative
    financial instruments written by us to our customers in our
    Business Solutions business. The duration of these derivative
    contracts is generally nine months or less. The credit risk
    associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign
    currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly
    impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver
    currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. To
    mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an
    ongoing basis and we may require certain customers to post
    collateral or increase collateral based on the fair value of the
    customer’s contract and their risk profile. The credit risk
    arising from our spot foreign currency exchange contracts is
    largely mitigated, as in most cases we require the receipt of
    funds from our customers before releasing the associated
    cross-currency payment.

Management’s
    Report on the Financial Statements

Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
    objectivity of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements and the related financial information. The financial
    statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    and necessarily include certain amounts that are based on
    estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared
    the related financial information included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the
    financial statements.

As stated in their report included elsewhere in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

the consolidated financial statements have been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm who conducted their audits in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010. The independent registered public accounting firm’s
    responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness, in
    all material respects, with which such financial statements
    present our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Western Union
    Company’s (“Western Union” or the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Western Union’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are
    being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
    management and Board of Directors; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
    could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Western Union’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, utilizing the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the
    results of its evaluation, the Company’s management
    concluded that as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective. Western
    Union’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, Western Union’s independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union
    Company

We have audited The Western Union Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
    criteria). The Western Union Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, The Western Union Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of The Western Union Company as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’
    equity/(deficiency) for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2010 and our report dated February 25,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union
    Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    The Western Union Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows,
    and stockholders’ equity/(deficiency) for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of The Western Union Company at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), The
    Western Union Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Formation
    of the Entity and Basis of Presentation

The Western Union Company (“Western Union” or the
    “Company”) is a leader in global money movement and
    payment services, providing people and businesses with fast,
    reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments
    around the world. The Western
    Union

®

brand is globally recognized. The Company’s services are
    available through a network of agent locations in 200 countries
    and territories. Each location in the Company’s agent
    network is capable of providing one or more of the
    Company’s services.

The Western Union business consists of the following segments:

•

Consumer-to-consumer—money

transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global
    network of third-party agents using the Company’s
    multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems.
    This service is available for international cross-border
    transfers—that is, the transfer of funds from one country
    to another—and, in certain countries, intra-country
    transfers—that is, money transfers from one location to
    another in the same country.

•

Global business payments—the processing of payments from
    consumers or businesses to other businesses. The Company’s
    business payments services allow consumers to make payments to a
    variety of organizations including utilities, auto finance
    companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers,
    government agencies and other businesses. As described further
    in Note 4, in September 2009, the Company acquired
    Canada-based Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom House”),
    which has been rebranded “Western Union Business
    Solutions” (“Business Solutions”) and is included
    in this segment. This business facilitates cross-border,
    cross-currency

business-to-business

payment transactions. The international expansion and other key
    strategic initiatives have resulted in international revenue
    continuing to increase in this segment. However, the majority of
    the segment’s revenue was generated in the United States
    during all periods presented.

All businesses that have not been classified into the

consumer-to-consumer

or global business payments segments are reported as
    “Other” and primarily include the Company’s money
    order services business. Prior to October 1, 2009, the
    Company’s money orders were issued by Integrated Payment
    Systems Inc. (“IPS”), a subsidiary of First Data
    Corporation (“First Data”), to consumers at retail
    locations primarily in the United States and Canada. Effective
    October 1, 2009, the Company assumed the responsibility for
    issuing money orders.

There are legal or regulatory limitations on transferring
    certain assets of the Company outside of the countries where
    these assets are located, or which constitute undistributed
    earnings of affiliates of the Company accounted for under the
    equity method of accounting. However, there are generally no
    limitations on the use of these assets within those countries.
    Additionally, the Company must meet minimum capital requirements
    in some countries in order to maintain operating licenses. As of
    December 31, 2010, the amount of net assets subject to
    these limitations totaled approximately $210 million.

Various aspects of the Company’s services and businesses
    are subject to United States federal, state and local
    regulation, as well as regulation by foreign jurisdictions,
    including certain banking and other financial services
    regulations.

Spin-off
    from First Data

On January 26, 2006, the First Data Board of Directors
    announced its intention to pursue the distribution of all of its
    money transfer and consumer payments business and its interest
    in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related
    assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution
    to First Data shareholders (the “Spin-off”). Effective
    on September 29, 2006, First Data completed the separation
    and the distribution of these businesses by distributing The
    Western Union Company common stock to First Data shareholders
    (the “Distribution”). Prior to the Distribution, the
    Company had been a segment of First Data.



Basis
    of Presentation

The financial statements in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts
    of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
    significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
    eliminated.

Consistent with industry practice, the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets are unclassified due to the short-term nature of
    the Company’s settlement obligations contrasted with the
    Company’s ability to invest cash awaiting settlement in
    long-term investment securities.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ from these estimates.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The Company consolidates financial results when it has both the
    power to direct the activities of an entity that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    the ability to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of
    the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity.
    The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting when it is
    able to exercise significant influence over the entity’s
    operations, which generally occurs when the Company has an
    ownership interest of between 20% and 50% in an entity.

Earnings
    Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is computed by
    dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
    weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
    for the period. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded
    from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share
    reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding
    stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of
    restricted stock have vested, using the treasury stock method.
    The treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise
    price of stock options, the unamortized compensation expense and
    assumed tax benefits of options and restricted stock are
    available to acquire shares at an average market price
    throughout the year, and therefore, reduce the dilutive effect.

As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were
    34.0 million, 37.5 million and 8.0 million,
    respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of
    Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share
    calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive. During the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the average market price
    of the Company’s common stock was lower than the exercise
    price for most of its outstanding options, resulting in higher
    anti-dilutive shares than in 2008.

The following table provides the calculation of diluted
    weighted-average shares outstanding (in millions):

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair values of its assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    accordance with the hierarchy described below. The fair values
    of the assets and liabilities held in the Company’s



defined benefit plan trust (“Trust”) are recognized or
    disclosed utilizing the same hierarchy. The following three
    levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

•

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1
    prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
    quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs
    that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities. For most of these assets, the Company utilizes
    pricing services that use multiple prices as inputs to determine
    daily market values. In addition, the Trust has other
    investments that fall within Level 2 that are valued at net
    asset value which is not quoted on an active market, however,
    the unit price is based on underlying investments which are
    traded on an active market.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported by
    little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and
    liabilities include items where the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation. The
    Company has Level 3 assets that are recognized and
    disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis related to the
    Company’s business combinations, where the values of the
    intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a purchase are
    derived utilizing one of the three recognized approaches: the
    market approach, the income approach or the cost approach.

Except as it pertains to an investment redemption discussed in
    Note 9, carrying amounts for many of the Company’s
    financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
    settlement cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivables,
    settlement obligations, borrowings under the commercial paper
    program and other short-term notes payable, approximate fair
    value due to their short maturities. Investment securities,
    included in settlement assets, and derivative financial
    instruments are carried at fair value and included in
    Note 8. Fixed rate notes are carried at their original
    issuance values as adjusted over time to accrete that value to
    par, except for portions of notes hedged by interest rate swap
    agreements as disclosed in Note 14. The fair values of
    fixed rate notes are also disclosed in Note 15 and are
    based on market quotations. For more information on the fair
    value of financial instruments see Note 8.

The fair values of non-financial assets and liabilities related
    to the Company’s business combinations are disclosed in
    Note 4. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities
    related to the Trust are disclosed in Note 11.

Business
    Combinations

The Company accounts for all business combinations where control
    over another entity is obtained using the acquisition method of
    accounting, which requires that most assets (both tangible and
    intangible), liabilities (including contingent consideration),
    and remaining noncontrolling interests be recognized at fair
    value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase
    price over the fair value of assets less liabilities and
    noncontrolling interests is recognized as goodwill. Certain
    adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets,
    liabilities, or noncontrolling interests made subsequent to the
    acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is
    one year or less, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any
    adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in
    income. Any cost or equity method interest that the Company
    holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is
    remeasured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or
    loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value
    and existing book value. Results of operations of the acquired
    company are included in the Company’s results from the date
    of the acquisition forward and include amortization expense
    arising from acquired intangible assets. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company expenses all costs as incurred
    related to or involved with an acquisition in “Selling,
    general and administrative” expenses. Previously, such
    amounts were capitalized as part of the acquisition.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments (other than those included in
    settlement assets) with maturities of three months or less at
    the date of purchase (that are readily convertible to cash) are
    considered to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which
    approximates market value.



The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with
    various financial institutions, including a substantial portion
    in money market funds. The Company limits the concentration of
    its cash and cash equivalents with any one institution; however,
    such balances often exceed United States federal deposit
    insurance limits. The Company regularly reviews investment
    concentrations and credit worthiness of these institutions, and
    has relationships with a globally diversified list of banks and
    financial institutions.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts when it
    is probable that the related receivable balance will not be
    collected based on its history of collection experience, known
    collection issues, such as agent suspensions and bankruptcies,
    and other matters the Company identifies in its routine
    collection monitoring. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $21.1 million and $33.7 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, and is recorded in the same
    Consolidated Balance Sheet caption as the related receivable.
    During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    the provision for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) reflected
    in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $19.1 million,
    $36.2 million and $26.6 million, respectively.

Settlement
    Assets and Obligations

Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received
    from agents for unsettled money transfers, money orders and
    consumer payments. The Company records corresponding settlement
    obligations relating to amounts payable under money transfers,
    money orders and consumer payment service arrangements.
    Settlement assets and obligations also include amounts
    receivable from and payable to businesses for the value of
    customer cross-currency payment transactions related to the
    global business payments segment.

Settlement assets consist of cash and cash equivalents,
    receivables from selling agents and

business-to-business

customers, and investment securities. Cash received by Western
    Union agents generally becomes available to the Company within
    one week after initial receipt by the agent. Cash equivalents
    consist of short-term time deposits, commercial paper and other
    highly liquid investments. Receivables from selling agents
    represent funds collected by such agents, but in transit to the
    Company. Western Union has a large and diverse agent base,
    thereby reducing the credit risk of the Company from any one
    agent. In addition, the Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its agents’ financial condition and credit
    worthiness. See Note 7 for information concerning the
    Company’s investment securities.

Receivables from

business-to-business

customers arise from cross-currency payment transactions in the
    global business payments segment. Receivables (for currency to
    be received) and payables (for the cross-currency payments to be
    made) are recognized at trade date for these transactions. The
    credit risk arising from these spot foreign currency exchange
    contracts is largely mitigated, as in most cases Business
    Solutions requires the receipt of funds from customers before
    releasing the associated cross-currency payment.

Settlement obligations consist of money transfer, money order
    and payment service payables and payables to agents. Money
    transfer payables represent amounts to be paid to transferees
    when they request their funds. Money order payables represent
    amounts not yet presented for payment. Most agents typically
    settle with transferees first and then obtain reimbursement from
    the Company. Payment service payables represent amounts to be
    paid to utility companies, auto finance companies, mortgage
    servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and
    others. Due to the agent funding and settlement process,
    payables to agents represent amounts due to agents for money
    transfers that have been settled with transferees.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
    estimated life of the related assets (generally three to
    10 years for equipment, furniture and fixtures, and
    30 years for buildings) or the lease term. Maintenance and
    repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective
    assets, are charged to expense as incurred.

    $61.7 million during the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Deferred
    Customer Set Up Costs

The Company capitalizes direct incremental costs not to exceed
    related deferred revenues associated with the enrollment of
    customers in the Equity Accelerator program, a service that
    allows consumers to make mortgage payments based on a customized
    payment program. Deferred customer set up costs, included in
    “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
    amortized to “Cost of services” in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income over the length of the customer’s
    expected participation in the program, generally five to seven
    years. Actual customer attrition data is assessed at least
    annually and the amortization period is adjusted prospectively.



Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
    value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired, less
    liabilities assumed arising from business combinations. The
    Company’s annual goodwill impairment test did not identify
    any goodwill impairment during the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008.

Other
    Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets primarily consist of contract costs
    (primarily amounts paid to agents in connection with
    establishing and renewing long-term contracts), acquired
    contracts and software. Other intangible assets are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the length of the contract or benefit
    periods. Included in the Consolidated Statements of Income is
    amortization expense of approximately $114.4 million,
    $98.3 million and $82.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company capitalizes initial payments for new and renewed
    agent contracts to the extent recoverable through future
    operations or penalties in the case of early termination. The
    Company’s accounting policy is to limit the amount of
    capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the
    estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination
    fees the Company would receive in the event of early termination
    of the contract.

Acquired contracts include customer and contractual
    relationships and networks of subagents that are recognized in
    connection with the Company’s acquisitions.

The Company develops software that is used in providing
    services. Software development costs are capitalized once
    technological feasibility of the software has been established.
    Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility
    are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is
    established when the Company has completed all planning and
    designing activities that are necessary to determine that a
    product can be produced to meet its design specifications,
    including functions, features and technical performance
    requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is
    available for general use. Software development costs and
    purchased software are generally amortized over a term of three
    to five years.

    assets (in millions):

The estimated future aggregate amortization expense for existing
    other intangible assets as of December 31, 2010 is expected
    to be $103.8 million in 2011, $77.9 million in 2012,
    $58.0 million in 2013, $43.3 million in 2014,
    $33.5 million in 2015 and $121.5 million thereafter.

Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual
    basis and whenever events indicate that their carrying amount
    may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted
    cash flows associated with these assets or operations are
    compared with their carrying values to determine if a write-down
    to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique)
    is required. The Company recorded other intangible asset
    impairments of approximately $9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and did not record any impairment related
    to other intangible assets during the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.



Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from consumer
    money transfer transaction fees that are based on the principal
    amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which
    funds are transferred. The Company also offers several global
    business payments services, including payments from consumers or
    businesses to other businesses. Transaction fees are set by the
    Company and recorded as revenue at the time of sale.

In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments
    transactions involving different currencies, the Company
    generates revenue based on the difference between the exchange
    rate set by the Company to the customer and the rate at which
    the Company or its agents are able to acquire currency. This
    foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the related
    consumer money transfer transaction fee revenue is recognized or
    at the time a customer initiates a transaction through the
    Company’s cross-border, cross-currency international

business-to-business

payment service operations.

The Company’s Equity Accelerator service generally requires
    a consumer to pay an upfront enrollment fee to participate in
    this mortgage payment service. These enrollment fees are
    deferred and recognized into income over the length of the
    customer’s expected participation in the program, generally
    five to seven years. Actual customer attrition data is assessed
    at least annually and the period over which revenue is
    recognized is adjusted prospectively. Many factors impact the
    duration of the expected customer relationship, including
    interest rates, refinance activity and trends in consumer
    behavior.

Cost
    of Services

Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions and
    expenses for call centers, settlement operations, and related
    information technology costs. Expenses within these functions
    include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank
    fees, depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred
    in connection with providing money transfer and other payment
    services.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred
    or at the time the advertising first takes place. Advertising
    costs for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were $163.9 million, $201.4 million and
    $247.1 million, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability
    method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be determined based on the expected future income tax
    consequences of events that have been recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences
    between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases
    of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in
    the years in which the temporary differences are expected to
    reverse.

The Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax
    positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the
    technical merits of the position, the tax position will be
    sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any
    related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in
    the consolidated financial statements from such a position are
    measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
    percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The United States dollar is the functional currency for all of
    the Company’s businesses except global business payments
    subsidiaries located primarily in Canada and South America.
    Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
    prevailing during the period. Foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities for those entities for which the local
    currency is the functional currency are translated into United
    States dollars based on exchange rates at the end of the period.
    The effects of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from
    the translation of assets and liabilities of these entities are
    included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive
    loss.” Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
    liabilities of operations in which the United States dollar is
    the



functional currency are remeasured based on exchange rates at
    the end of the period and are recognized in operations.
    Non-monetary assets and liabilities of these operations are
    remeasured at historical rates in effect when the asset was
    recognized or the liability was incurred.

Derivatives

The Company utilizes derivatives to (a) minimize its
    exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency

business-to-business

payments by writing derivatives to customers. The Company
    recognizes all derivatives in the “Other assets” and
    “Other liabilities” captions in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. All cash flows
    associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from
    operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows.

•

Cash Flow hedges—Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded
    in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” Cash flow
    hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted
    revenues, as well as, from time to time, hedges of the
    forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Derivative fair value
    changes that are captured in “Accumulated other
    comprehensive loss” are reclassified to earnings in the
    same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings. The
    portions of the change in fair value that are excluded from the
    measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in
    “Derivative losses, net.”

•

Fair Value hedges—Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    that are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt are
    recorded in “Interest expense.” The offsetting change
    in value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes
    in the benchmark interest rate is also recorded in
    “Interest expense.”

•

Undesignated—Derivative contracts entered into to reduce
    the variability related to (a) money transfer settlement
    assets and obligations, generally with maturities of a few days
    up to one month, and (b) certain money transfer related
    foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany
    loans, generally with maturities of less than one year, are not
    designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in
    their fair value are included in “Selling, general and
    administrative.” Subsequent to the acquisition of Custom
    House, the Company is also exposed to risk from derivative
    contracts written to its customers arising from its
    cross-currency

business-to-business

payments operations. These contracts have durations generally of
    nine months or less. The Company aggregates its foreign exchange
    exposures in its Business Solutions business, including the
    exposure generated by the derivative contracts it writes to its
    customers as part of its cross-currency payments business, and
    typically hedges the net exposure through offsetting contracts
    with established financial institution counterparties (economic
    hedge contract) as part of a broader foreign currency portfolio,
    including significant spot exchanges of currency in addition to
    forwards and options. To mitigate credit risk, the Company
    performs credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis. The
    changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in
    “Foreign exchange revenues.”

The fair value of the Company’s derivatives is derived from
    standardized models that use market based inputs (e.g., forward
    prices for foreign currency).

The details of each designated hedging relationship are formally
    documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the
    risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item,
    specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how
    effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any,
    will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in
    offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged
    item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a
    retrospective and prospective basis.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company currently has a stock-based compensation plan that
    provides for grants of Western Union stock options, restricted
    stock awards and restricted stock units to employees who perform
    services for the Company. In addition, the Company has a
    stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of
    Western Union stock options and stock unit awards to
    non-employee directors of the Company. Prior to the Spin-off,
    employees of Western Union participated in First Data’s
    stock-based compensation plans.



All stock-based compensation to employees is required to be
    measured at fair value and expensed over the requisite service
    period and also requires an estimate of forfeitures when
    calculating compensation expense. The Company recognizes
    compensation expense on awards on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period for the entire award. Refer to
    Note 16 for additional discussion regarding details of the
    Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Restructuring
    and Related Expenses

The Company records severance-related expenses once they are
    both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of
    the applicable accounting guidance for severance provided under
    an ongoing benefit arrangement. One-time, involuntary benefit
    arrangements and other exit costs are generally recognized when
    the liability is incurred. Expenses arising under the
    Company’s defined benefit pension plans from curtailing
    future service of employees participating in the plans and
    providing enhanced benefits are recognized in earnings when it
    is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company also evaluates
    impairment issues associated with restructuring activities when
    the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable,
    in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance.
    Restructuring and related expenses consist of direct and
    incremental expenses associated with restructuring and related
    activities, including severance, outplacement and other employee
    related benefits; facility closure and migration of the
    Company’s IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to
    the relocation of various operations to new or existing Company
    facilities and third-party providers, including hiring,
    training, relocation, travel and professional fees. Also
    included in the facility closure expenses are non-cash expenses
    related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and
    the acceleration of depreciation and amortization. For more
    information on the Company’s restructuring and related
    expenses see Note 3.

Restructuring
    and Related Expenses

    Plan

On May 25, 2010 and as subsequently revised, the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan
    (the “Restructuring Plan”) designed to reduce the
    Company’s overall headcount and migrate positions from
    various facilities, primarily within the United States and
    Europe, to regional operating centers. Details of the estimated
    expenses are included in the tables below. Included in these
    estimated expenses are approximately $2 million of non-cash
    expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement
    write-offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities.
    Subject to complying with and undertaking the necessary
    individual and collective employee information and consultation
    obligations as may be required by local law for potentially
    affected employees, the Company expects all of these activities
    to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2011. The
    foregoing figures are the Company’s estimates and are
    subject to change as the Restructuring Plan continues to be
    implemented.



The following table summarizes the activity for the
    restructuring and related expenses discussed above and the
    related restructuring accruals for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 (in millions):

    to new and existing Company facilities including expenses for
    hiring, training, relocation, travel and professional fees. All
    such expenses will be recorded when incurred.

    Plans

During 2008, the Company closed substantially all of its
    facilities in Missouri and Texas and did not renew the
    Company’s collective bargaining agreement with the
    unionized workers employed at these locations. The decision also
    resulted in the elimination of certain management positions in
    these same facilities and resulted, along with other actions, in
    the Company no longer having employees working in the United
    States under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company also
    restructured some of its operations and relocated or eliminated
    certain shared service and call center positions. The relocated
    positions were moved to the Company’s existing facilities
    or outsourced service providers in 2008.

The Company incurred severance and employee related benefit
    expenses for all union and certain affected management
    employees, facility closure expenses and other expenses
    associated with the relocation of these operations to existing
    Company facilities and third-party providers, including costs
    related to hiring, training, relocation, travel and professional
    fees.

The Company incurred cumulative total expenses of
    $82.9 million comprised of $44.3 million,
    $7.9 million, $7.8 million and $22.9 million in
    severance and other employee related costs, asset write-offs and
    incremental depreciation, lease terminations and other
    restructuring expenses, respectively, through December 31,
    2008. No additional restructuring and related expenses were
    incurred in the year ended December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had a restructuring
    accrual of $25.8 million related to these plans, of which
    $24.8 million represented an accrual for severance and
    employee related expenses. During 2009, substantially all of the
    accruals were paid resulting in a remaining restructuring
    accrual which was immaterial at December 31, 2009.



The 2010 and 2008 restructuring and related expenses are
    reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows

Acquisitions

Angelo
    Costa, S.r.l.

In December 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to
    acquire the remaining 70% interest which the Company currently
    does not own, in Angelo Costa S.r.l. (“Costa”), one of
    the Company’s largest money transfer agents in Europe. The
    Company will acquire the 70% interest for cash of
    €100 million (approximately $133 million based on
    currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010), less a
    working capital deficiency adjustment to be determined at
    closing. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half
    of 2011, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of
    closing conditions. The acquisition will be recognized at 100%
    of the fair value of Costa, which will exceed the estimated cash
    consideration due to the revaluation of the Company’s 30%
    interest to fair value, which is expected to result in a gain.
    Both the fair value amount of the acquisition and the amount of
    the gain will be determined and recorded upon closing and are
    subject to fluctuation based on changes in exchange rates and
    other valuation inputs.

Custom
    House, Ltd.

On September 1, 2009, the Company acquired Canada-based
    Custom House, a provider of international

business-to-business

payment services, for $371.0 million. The acquisition of
    Custom House has allowed the Company to enter the international

business-to-business

payments market. Custom House facilitates cross-border,
    cross-currency payment transactions. These payment transactions
    are conducted through various channels including the telephone
    and internet. The significant majority of Custom House’s
    revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling
    customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, this
    business writes foreign currency forward and option contracts
    for its customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of
    these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less.
    The results of operations for Custom House have been included in
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the
    date of acquisition, September 1, 2009.



The Company recorded the assets and liabilities of Custom House
    at fair value, excluding the deferred tax liability. The
    following table summarizes the final allocation of purchase
    price, which differs only slightly from the preliminary
    allocation primarily due to an $8.3 million adjustment
    related to tax, which resulted in reductions to the deferred tax
    liability and goodwill (in millions):

The valuation of assets acquired resulted in $118.1 million
    of identifiable intangible assets, $99.8 million of which
    were attributable to customer and other contractual
    relationships and were valued using an income approach and
    $18.3 million of other intangibles, which were valued using
    both income and cost approaches. These fair values were derived
    using primarily unobservable Level 3 inputs which require
    significant management judgment and estimation. For the
    remaining assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, fair value
    approximated carrying value. The intangible assets related to
    customer and other contractual relationships are being amortized
    over 10 to 12 years. The remaining intangibles are being
    amortized over three to five years. The goodwill recognized of
    $264.3 million is attributable to the projected long-term
    business growth in current and new markets and an assembled
    workforce. All goodwill relates entirely to the global business
    payments segment. Goodwill expected to be deductible for United
    States income tax purposes is approximately $231.3 million.

Other
    acquisitions

On February 24, 2009, the Company acquired the money
    transfer business of European-based FEXCO, one of the
    Company’s largest agents providing services in a number of
    European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden
    and Ireland. The acquisition of FEXCO’s money transfer
    business has assisted the Company in the implementation of the
    Payment Services Directive (“PSD”) in the European
    Union by providing an initial operating infrastructure. The PSD
    has allowed the Company to operate under a single license in 27
    European countries and, in those European Union countries where
    the Company has been limited to working with banks, post-banks
    and foreign exchange houses, to expand its network to additional
    types of businesses. The acquisition does not impact the
    Company’s revenue, because the Company was already
    recording all of the revenue arising from money transfers
    originating at FEXCO’s locations. As of the acquisition
    date, the Company no longer incurs commission costs for
    transactions related to FEXCO; rather, the Company now pays
    commissions directly to former FEXCO subagents, resulting in
    lower overall commission expense. The Company’s operating
    expenses include costs attributable to FEXCO’s operations
    subsequent to the acquisition date.

Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 24.65% interest in
    FEXCO Group Holdings (“FEXCO Group”), which was a
    holding company for both the money transfer business as well as
    various unrelated businesses. The Company surrendered its 24.65%
    interest in FEXCO Group as non-cash consideration, which had an
    estimated fair



value of $86.2 million on the acquisition date, and paid
    €123.1 million ($157.4 million) as additional
    consideration for all of the common shares of the money transfer
    business, resulting in a total purchase price of
    $243.6 million. The Company recognized no gain or loss in
    connection with the disposition of its equity interest in the
    FEXCO Group, because its estimated fair value approximated its
    carrying value. The Company recorded the assets and liabilities
    of FEXCO at fair value, excluding the deferred tax liability.
    The valuation of assets acquired resulted in $74.9 million
    of identifiable intangible assets, $64.8 million of which
    were attributable to the network of subagents, with
    $10.1 million relating to other intangibles. The subagent
    network intangible assets are being amortized over 10 to
    15 years, and the remaining intangibles are being amortized
    over two to three years. Goodwill of $190.6 million was
    recognized, of which $91.1 million is expected to be
    deductible for United States income tax purposes.

In December 2008, the Company acquired 80% of its existing money
    transfer agent in Peru for a purchase price of
    $35.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid was
    $29.7 million, net of a holdback reserve of
    $3.0 million. The Company acquired cash of
    $2.3 million as part of the acquisition. $1.0 million
    holdback reserve payments were made in both 2009 and 2010, and
    the remaining $1.0 million is scheduled to be paid in
    December 2011, subject to the terms of the agreement. The
    results of operations of the acquiree have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements since the
    acquisition date. The purchase price allocation resulted in
    $10.1 million of identifiable intangible assets, a
    significant portion of which were attributable to the network of
    subagents acquired by the Company. The identifiable intangible
    assets are being amortized over three to 10 years and
    goodwill of $27.1 million was recorded, most of which is
    expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. In addition,
    the Company has the option to acquire the remaining 20% of the
    money transfer agent and the money transfer agent has the option
    to sell the remaining 20% to the Company within 12 months
    after December 2013 at fair value.

In August 2008, the Company acquired the money transfer assets
    from its then-existing money transfer agent in Panama for a
    purchase price of $18.3 million. The consideration paid was
    $14.3 million, net of a holdback reserve of
    $4.0 million. In 2009 and 2010, the Company paid
    $1.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of the
    holdback reserve, with the remainder scheduled to be paid in
    August 2011, subject to the terms of the agreement. The results
    of operations of the acquiree have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements since the
    acquisition date. The purchase price allocation resulted in
    $5.6 million of identifiable intangible assets, a
    significant portion of which were attributable to the network of
    subagents acquired by the Company. The identifiable intangible
    assets are being amortized over three to seven years and
    goodwill of $14.2 million was recorded, which is not
    expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The following table presents changes to goodwill for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions):

Related
    Party Transactions

The Company has ownership interests in certain of its agents
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company
    pays these agents, as it does its other agents, commissions for
    money transfer and other services provided on the Company’s
    behalf. Commission expense recognized for these agents for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled
    $183.5 million, $203.2 million and
    $305.9 million, respectively. Commission expense recognized
    for FEXCO prior to February 24, 2009, the date of the
    acquisition (see Note 4), was considered a related party
    transaction.



In July 2009, the Company appointed a director who is also a
    director for a company holding significant investments in two of
    the Company’s existing agents. These agents had been agents
    of the Company prior to the director being appointed to the
    board. The Company recognized commission expense of
    $52.9 million and $54.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to these agents.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Letters
    of Credit and Bank Guarantees

The Company had approximately $85 million in outstanding
    letters of credit and bank guarantees at December 31, 2010
    with expiration dates through 2015, the majority of which
    contain a one-year renewal option. The letters of credit and
    bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease
    arrangements and certain agent agreements. The Company expects
    to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to
    expiration in most circumstances.

Litigation
    and Related Contingencies

In the second quarter of 2009, the Antitrust Division of the
    United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) served one
    of the Company’s subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena
    requesting documents in connection with an investigation into
    money transfers, including related foreign exchange rates, from
    the United States to the Dominican Republic from 2004 through
    the date of subpoena. The Company is cooperating fully with the
    DOJ investigation. Due to the stage of the investigation, the
    Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation,
    or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be
    associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges
    or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Should
    such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face
    significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences
    which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business, financial position and results of operations.

The Company is a defendant in two purported class action
    lawsuits: James P. Tennille v. The Western Union Company,
    and Robert P. Smet v. The Western Union Company, both of
    which are pending in the United States District Court for the
    District of Colorado. The complaints assert claims for violation
    of various consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment,
    conversion and declaratory relief, based on allegations that the
    Company waits too long to inform consumers if their money
    transfers are not redeemed by the recipients and that the
    Company uses the unredeemed funds to generate income until the
    funds are escheated to state governments. The Tennille complaint
    was served on the Company on April 27, 2009. The Smet
    complaint was served on the Company on April 6, 2010. On
    September 21, 2009, the Court granted the Company’s
    motion to dismiss the Tennille complaint and gave the plaintiff
    leave to file an amended complaint. On October 21, 2009,
    Tennille filed an amended complaint. The Company moved to
    dismiss the Tennille amended complaint and the Smet complaint.
    On November 8, 2010, the Court denied Western Union’s
    motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment
    and conversion claims. On February 4, 2011, the Court
    dismissed plaintiffs’ consumer protection claims. The
    plaintiffs have not sought and the Court has not granted class
    certification. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself
    against both lawsuits. However, due to the preliminary stages of
    these lawsuits, the fact the plaintiffs have not quantified
    their damage demands, and the uncertainty as to whether they
    will ever be certified as class actions, the Company is unable
    to determine the potential outcome.

During the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded an
    accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement
    with the State of Arizona and other states, which was paid in
    2010. On February 11, 2010, the Company signed this
    agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal
    issues and claims with the State and requires the Company to
    fund a multi-state

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New
    Mexico are participating with Arizona. The accrual includes
    amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs
    associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the
    agreement and settlement, the Company has made and expects to
    make certain investments in its compliance programs along the
    United States and Mexico border and has engaged a monitor for
    those programs, which are expected to cost up to
    $23 million over the period from signing to 2013.

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    claims and litigation. Management of the Company believes such
    matters involving a reasonably possible chance of loss will not,
    individually or in the aggregate, result



in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company
    accrues for loss contingencies as they become probable and
    estimable.

In May 2007, the Company initiated litigation against MoneyGram
    Payment Systems, Inc. (“MoneyGram”) for infringement
    of the Company’s Money Transfer by Phone patents by
    MoneyGram’s FormFree service. On September 24, 2009, a
    jury found that MoneyGram was liable for patent infringement and
    awarded the Company $16.5 million in damages. On
    December 7, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Federal Circuit reversed the trial court’s judgment. On
    January 6, 2011, the Company filed a Combined Petition for
    Panel Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc in the Federal Circuit,
    which was denied on February 8, 2011. In accordance with
    its policies, the Company does not recognize gain contingencies
    in earnings until realization and collectability are assured.

Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with First
    Data in connection with the Spin-off, First Data and the Company
    are each liable for, and agreed to perform, all liabilities with
    respect to their respective businesses. In addition, the
    separation and distribution agreement also provides for
    cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial
    responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the
    Company’s business with the Company and financial
    responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of First
    Data’s retained businesses with First Data. The Company
    also entered into a tax allocation agreement that sets forth the
    rights and obligations of First Data and the Company with
    respect to taxes imposed on their respective businesses both
    prior to and after the Spin-off as well as potential tax
    obligations for which the Company may be liable in conjunction
    with the Spin-off (see Note 10).

Investment
    Securities

Investment securities, classified within “Settlement
    assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist
    primarily of high-quality state and municipal debt securities.
    The Company is required to maintain specific high-quality,
    investment grade securities and such investments are restricted
    to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with
    applicable state and foreign country requirements. The
    substantial majority of the Company’s investment securities
    are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at fair value. Investment securities are exposed to
    market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk.
    The Company regularly monitors credit risk and attempts to
    mitigate its exposure by making high-quality investments and
    through investment diversification. At December 31, 2010,
    the majority of the Company’s investment securities had
    credit ratings of “AA-” or better from a major credit
    rating agency.

On October 1, 2009 (the “Transition Date”), the
    Company assumed IPS’s role as issuer of money orders and
    terminated the existing agreement whereby IPS paid the Company a
    fixed return of 5.5% on the outstanding money order balances.
    Following the Transition Date, the Company invested the cash
    received from IPS in high-quality, investment grade securities,
    primarily tax exempt United States state and municipal debt
    securities, in accordance with applicable regulations. Prior to
    the Transition Date, the Company had entered into interest rate
    swaps on certain of its fixed rate notes to reduce its exposure
    to fluctuations in interest rates. Through a combination of the
    revenue generated from these investment securities and the
    anticipated interest expense savings resulting from the interest
    rate swaps, the Company estimates that it should be able to
    retain a materially comparable after-tax rate of return through
    2011 as it was receiving under its agreement with IPS. Refer to
    Note 14 for additional information on the interest rate
    swaps.

Subsequent to the Transition Date, all revenue generated from
    the investment portfolio is being retained by the Company. IPS
    continues to provide the Company with clearing services
    necessary for payment of the money orders in exchange for the
    payment by the Company to IPS of a per-item processing fee. The
    Company no longer provides to IPS the services required under
    the original money order agreement or receives from IPS the fee
    for such services.

In 2008, the Company began increasing its investment levels in
    various state and municipal variable rate demand note securities
    which can be put (sold at par) typically on a daily basis with
    settlement periods ranging from the same day to one week, but
    that have varying maturities through 2042. Generally, these
    securities are used by the Company for short-term liquidity
    needs and are held for short periods of time, typically less
    than 30 days. As a result, this has increased the frequency
    of purchases and proceeds received by the Company.



Unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities are excluded from earnings and presented as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net
    of related deferred taxes. Proceeds from the sale and maturity
    of

available-for-sale

securities during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 were $14.7 billion, $8.4 billion and
    $2.8 billion, respectively. The transition of the money
    order business from IPS in October 2009, as described above,
    increased the frequency of purchases and proceeds received by
    the Company in 2010.

Gains and losses on investments are calculated using the
    specific-identification method and are recognized during the
    period in which the investment is sold or when an investment
    experiences an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. Factors that could indicate an impairment
    exists include, but are not limited to: earnings performance,
    changes in credit rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or
    economic environment of the asset. If potential impairment
    exists, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell
    the debt security, more likely than not will be required to sell
    the debt security before its anticipated recovery or expects
    that some of the contractual cash flows will not be received.
    The Company had no material

other-than-temporary

impairments during the periods presented.

    the Company may have the right to put the obligation prior to
    its contractual maturity, as with variable



rate demand notes. Variable rate demand notes, having a fair
    value of $38.0 million, $71.8 million and
    $380.2 million are included in the “Due after
    1 year through 5 years,” “Due after

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair value, as defined by the relevant accounting standards,
    represents the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. For additional information on how the Company
    measures fair value, refer to Note 2.

The carrying amounts for the Company’s financial
    instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, settlement
    cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivables and settlement
    obligations approximate fair value due to their short
    maturities. The Company’s borrowings had a carrying value
    and fair value of $3,289.9 million and



$3,473.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010
    and had a carrying value and fair value of $3,048.5 million
    and $3,211.3 million, respectively, at December 31,
    2009 (see Note 15).

The fair value of the assets in the Trust, which holds the

Receivable
    for securities sold

On September 15, 2008, Western Union requested redemption
    of its shares from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund,
    Ltd. (the “Fund”), a money market fund, totaling
    $298.1 million. Western Union included the value of the
    receivable in “Other assets” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. At the time the redemption request was made, the
    Company was informed by the Reserve Management Company, the
    Fund’s investment advisor, that the Company’s
    redemption trades would be honored at a $1.00 per share net
    asset value despite losses the Fund had incurred on certain
    holdings resulting in the Fund subsequently reducing its net
    asset value. In 2009, the Company received partial distributions
    totaling $255.5 million from the Fund and recorded a
    reserve of $12 million, representing the estimated impact
    of a pro-rata distribution of the Fund. On December 31,
    2010, the Company received a final distribution from the Fund
    totaling $36.9 million. As a result of the final
    distribution, the Company recovered $6.3 million of the
    related reserve, the impact of which is included in “Other
    income” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Domestic taxes have been incurred on certain pre-tax income
    amounts that were generated by the Company’s foreign
    operations. Accordingly, the percentage obtained by dividing the
    total federal, state and local tax provision by the domestic
    pre-tax income, all as shown in the preceding tables, may be
    higher than the statutory tax rates in the United States.

The Company continues to benefit from an increasing proportion
    of profits being foreign-derived and therefore taxed at lower
    rates than its combined federal and state tax rates in the
    United States. In addition, during 2010 the Company has also
    benefitted from cumulative and ongoing tax planning benefits,
    including benefits related to certain previous foreign
    acquisitions, and certain IRS settlements related to 2002
    through 2004.

Uncertain
    Tax Positions

The Company has established contingency reserves for material,
    known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments
    with respect to its international operations, which were
    restructured in 2003. The Company’s tax reserves reflect
    management’s judgment as to the resolution of the issues
    involved if subject to judicial review. While the Company
    believes its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected
    tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an
    issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial
    cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to
    these reserves, the Company’s income tax expense would
    include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from
    material changes during the period in the facts and
    circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue
    and (ii) any difference from the Company’s tax
    position as recorded in the financial statements and the final
    resolution of a tax issue during the period.

Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of
    differences between tax return positions and the amounts
    otherwise recognized in the Company’s financial statements,
    and are reflected in “Income taxes payable”



in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits,
    excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):

Changes to positions taken in prior periods relate to changes in
    estimates used to calculate prior period unrecognized tax
    benefits.

In the first quarter of 2010, the Company made a
    $250 million refundable tax deposit relating to potential
    United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising
    from the Company’s 2003 international restructuring, which
    have been previously accrued in the Company’s financial
    statements. The deposit was recorded as a reduction to
    “Income taxes payable” in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and a decrease in cash flows from operating activities in
    the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Making the deposit
    limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to
    such potential tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit.

A substantial portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefits relate to the 2003 restructuring of the Company’s
    international operations whereby the Company’s income from
    certain

foreign-to-foreign

money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low
    foreign tax rates compared to the Company’s combined
    federal and state tax rates in the United States. The total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
    affect the effective tax rate was $555.5 million and
    $468.6 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, excluding interest and penalties.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties with respect to
    unrecognized tax benefits in “Provision for income
    taxes” in its Consolidated Statements of Income, and
    records the associated liability in “Income taxes
    payable” in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company
    recognized $6.9 million, $11.0 million and
    $11.6 million in interest and penalties during the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    Company has accrued $52.4 million and $45.5 million
    for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Subject to the matter referenced in the paragraph below, the
    Company has identified no other uncertain tax positions for
    which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or
    decrease within 12 months, except for recurring accruals on
    existing uncertain tax positions. The change in unrecognized tax
    benefits during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
    is substantially attributable to such recurring accruals.

The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns for the United
    States, for multiple states and localities, and for various

non-United

States jurisdictions, and the Company has identified the United
    States and Ireland as its two major tax jurisdictions. The
    United States federal income tax returns of First Data, which
    include the Company, are eligible to be examined for the years
    2002 through 2006. The Company’s United States federal
    income tax returns since the Spin-off are also eligible to be
    examined. In the second quarter of 2010, the IRS, First Data and
    the Company reached a resolution of all outstanding issues
    related to First Data’s United States federal consolidated
    income tax return for 2002 (which included issues related to the
    Company). The resolution did not result in a material change to
    the Company’s financial position. In addition, the IRS
    completed its examination of the United States federal
    consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004,
    which included the Company, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in
    December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency alleges significant
    additional taxes, interest and penalties owed with respect to a
    variety of adjustments involving the Company and its
    subsidiaries, and



the Company generally has responsibility for taxes associated
    with these potential Company-related adjustments under the tax
    allocation agreement with First Data executed at the time of the
    Spin-off. The Company agrees with a number of the adjustments in
    the Notice of Deficiency; however, the Company does not agree
    with the Notice of Deficiency regarding several substantial
    adjustments representing total alleged additional tax and
    penalties due of approximately $114 million. As of
    December 31, 2010, interest on the alleged amounts due for
    unagreed adjustments would be approximately $36 million. A
    substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed
    adjustments relates to the Company’s international
    restructuring, which took effect in the fourth quarter of 2003,
    and accordingly, the alleged amounts due related to such
    restructuring largely are attributable to 2004. On
    March 20, 2009, the Company filed a petition in the United
    States Tax Court contesting those adjustments with which it does
    not agree. In September 2010, IRS Counsel referred the case to
    the IRS Appeals Division for possible settlement. The Company
    believes its overall reserves are adequate, including those
    associated with the adjustments alleged in the Notice of
    Deficiency. If the IRS’ position in the Notice of
    Deficiency is sustained, the Company’s tax provision
    related to 2003 and later years would materially increase. An
    examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax
    returns of First Data that cover the Company’s 2005 and
    pre-spin-off 2006 taxable periods is ongoing, as is an
    examination of the Company’s United States federal
    consolidated income tax returns for the 2006 post-spin-off
    period, 2007 and 2008. The Irish income tax returns of certain
    subsidiaries for the years 2006 and forward are eligible to be
    examined by the Irish tax authorities, although no examinations
    have commenced.

At December 31, 2010, no provision had been made for United
    States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of
    approximately $2.5 billion, which are expected to be
    reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. Upon
    distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form
    of actual or constructive dividends, the Company would be
    subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment
    for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible
    withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
    Determination of this amount of unrecognized deferred United
    States tax liability is not practicable because of the
    complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Tax
    Allocation Agreement with First Data

The Company and First Data each are liable for taxes imposed on
    their respective businesses both prior to and after the
    Spin-off. If such taxes have not been appropriately apportioned
    between First Data and the Company, subsequent adjustments may
    occur that may impact the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations.

Also under the tax allocation agreement, with respect to taxes
    and other liabilities that result from a final determination
    that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of
    the Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and
    relevant tax opinion) (“Spin-off Related Taxes”), the
    Company will be liable to First Data for any such Spin-off
    Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by or with
    respect to the Company. In addition, the Company will also be
    liable for half of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that
    would not have been imposed but for the existence of both an
    action by the Company and an action by First Data or
    (ii) where the Company and First Data each take actions
    that, standing alone, would have resulted in the imposition of
    such Spin-off Related Taxes. The Company may be similarly liable
    if it breaches certain representations or covenants set forth in
    the tax allocation agreement. If the Company is required to
    indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the
    Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    financial position and results of operations. First Data
    generally will be liable for all Spin-off Related Taxes, other
    than those described above.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Defined
    Contribution Plans

The Western Union Company Incentive Savings Plan
    (“401(k)”) covers eligible employees on the United
    States payroll of the Company. Employees who make voluntary
    contributions to this plan receive up to a 4% Company matching
    contribution. All matching contributions are immediately vested.

On September 30, 2009, the Company merged its defined
    contribution plan covering its former union employees and
    transferred the plan assets into the 401(k).



The Company administers more than 20 defined contribution plans
    in various countries globally on behalf of approximately
    1,000 employee participants as of December 31, 2010.
    Such plans have vesting and employer contribution provisions
    that vary by country.

In addition, the Company sponsors a non-qualified deferred
    compensation plan for a select group of highly compensated
    employees. The plan provides tax-deferred contributions,
    matching and the restoration of Company matching contributions
    otherwise limited under the 401(k).

The aggregate amount charged to expense in connection with all
    of the above plans was $12.0 million, $11.2 million
    and $12.5 million during the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Defined
    Benefit Plan

On December 31, 2010, the Company merged its two frozen
    defined benefit pension plans into one plan (“Plan”).
    The Plan assets were held in a master trust and were identical
    in terms of their benefit entitlements and other provisions
    (except for participant eligibility requirements) and
    consequently, the financial effect of the merger was not
    significant.

The Plan had a recorded unfunded pension obligation of
    $112.8 million as of December 31, 2010, included in
    “Other liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. In the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    made approximately $25 million in contributions to the
    Plan, including a discretionary contribution of
    $10 million. Due to the closure of one of its facilities in
    Missouri (see Note 3) and an agreement with the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Company funded
    $4.1 million during 2009. No contributions were made to the
    Plan during the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company
    will be required to fund approximately $22 million to the
    Plan in 2011 and may make a discretionary contribution of up to
    approximately $3 million.

The Company recognizes the funded status of the Plan in its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to
    “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” net of tax.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in
    the Plan’s projected benefit obligation, fair value of
    assets and the funded status (in millions):

Differences in expected returns on plan assets estimated at the
    beginning of the year versus actual returns, and assumptions
    used to estimate the beginning of year projected benefit
    obligation versus the end of year obligation (principally
    discount rate and mortality assumptions) are, on a combined
    basis, considered actuarial gains and losses. Such actuarial
    gains and losses are recognized as a component of
    “Comprehensive income” and amortized to



income over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan
    participants. Included in “Accumulated other comprehensive
    loss” at December 31, 2010 is $8.1 million
    ($5.0 million, net of tax) of actuarial losses that are
    expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during
    the year ended December 31, 2011.

During 2008, the Company recorded $2.8 million of expense
    relating to the termination of certain retirement eligible union
    and management plan participants in connection with the
    restructuring and related activities disclosed in Note 3.

The accrued loss related to the pension liability included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, increased
    $3.9 million, $11.3 million and $46.4 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The significant increase in
    the accrued loss included in accumulated other comprehensive
    loss in 2008 was caused by a decline in the fair value of plan
    assets, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in the
    value of the equity securities within the plan asset portfolio.

The rate assumptions used in the measurement of the
    Company’s benefit obligation were as follows:



Discount rate

4.69

5.30

The weighted-average rate assumptions used in the measurement of
    the Company’s net cost were as follows:

The Company measures the Plan’s obligations and annual
    expense using assumptions that reflect best estimates and are
    consistent to the extent that each assumption reflects
    expectations of future economic conditions. As the bulk of the
    pension benefits will not be paid for many years, the
    computation of pension expenses and benefits is based on
    assumptions about future interest rates and expected rates of
    return on plan assets. In general, pension obligations are most
    sensitive to the discount rate assumption, and it is set based
    on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled
    effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the
    timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the
    rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived
    from AA bonds of varying maturities.

The Company employs a building block approach in determining the
    long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are
    studied and long-term historical relationships between equities
    and fixed-income securities are considered consistent with the
    widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher
    volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current
    market factors such as inflation and interest rates are
    evaluated



before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.
    Consideration is given to diversification, re-balancing and
    yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical
    returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and
    appropriateness. The Company then applies this rate against a
    calculated value for its plan assets. The calculated value
    recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a
    five-year period.

Pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and target allocations based on investment policies, were

The assets of the Company’s Plan are managed in a
    third-party Trust. The investment policy and allocation of the
    assets in the Trust are overseen by the Company’s
    Investment Council. The Company employs a total return
    investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
    investments are used in an effort to maximize the long-term
    return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk
    tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan
    liabilities and plan funded status. The investment portfolio
    contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income
    investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified
    across United States and

non-United

States stocks, as well as securities deemed to be growth, value,
    and small and large capitalizations. Other assets, primarily
    private equity, are used judiciously in an effort to enhance
    long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. The
    investments in the Trust also include certain derivatives. On
    behalf of the Plan, investment advisors may enter into
    derivative contracts to manage interest rate risks. These
    contracts are contractual obligations to buy or sell a United
    States treasury bond or note at predetermined future dates and
    prices. Futures are transacted in standardized amounts on
    regulated exchanges. Investment risk is measured and monitored
    on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio
    reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and
    liability studies. In early 2011, the Company revised its target
    asset allocation to approximately 15% in equity investments, 60%
    in fixed income securities and 25% in alternative investment
    strategies in order to increase diversification.



The following tables reflect investments of the Trust that were

Operating
    Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain real properties for use as customer
    service centers and administrative and sales offices. The
    Company also leases data communications terminals, computers and
    office equipment. Certain of these leases contain renewal
    options and escalation provisions. Total rent expense under
    operating leases, net of sublease income, was
    $34.7 million, $34.0 million and $39.7 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, the minimum aggregate rental

Stockholders’
    Equity

Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes all changes in
    equity during a period that have yet to be recognized in income,
    except those resulting from transactions with shareholders. The
    major components include unrealized gains and losses on
    investment securities, gains or losses from cash flow hedging
    activities, foreign currency translation adjustments and pension
    liability adjustments.

Unrealized gains and losses on investment securities that are
    available for sale, primarily state and municipal debt
    securities, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
    until the investment is either sold or deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired. See Note 7 for further discussion.

The effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives
    that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss. Generally, amounts are recognized in
    income when the related forecasted transaction affects earnings.
    See Note 14 for further discussion.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose
    functional currency is not the United States dollar are
    translated using the appropriate exchange rate as of the end of
    the year. Foreign currency translation adjustments represent
    unrealized gains and losses on assets and liabilities arising
    from the difference in the foreign country currency compared to
    the United States dollar. These gains and losses are accumulated
    in comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is
    substantially liquidated, the cumulative translation gain or
    loss is removed from “Accumulated other comprehensive
    loss” and is recognized as a component of the gain or loss
    on the sale of the subsidiary.

A pension liability adjustment associated with the defined
    benefit pension plan is recognized for the difference between
    estimated assumptions (e.g., asset returns, discount rates,
    mortality) and actual results. The amount in “Accumulated
    other comprehensive loss” is amortized to income over the
    remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Details of
    the pension plan’s assets and obligations are explained
    further in Note 11.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
    resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the
    euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar
    and other currencies, related to forecasted money transfer
    revenues and on money transfer settlement assets and
    obligations. Subsequent to the acquisition of Custom House, the
    Company is also exposed to risk from derivative contracts
    written to its customers arising from its cross-currency

business-to-business

payments operations. Additionally, the Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk related to changes in market rates both prior
    to and subsequent to the issuance of debt. The Company uses
    derivatives to (a) minimize its exposures related to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates
    and (b) facilitate cross-currency

business-to-business

payments by writing derivatives to customers.

The Company executes derivatives related to its

consumer-to-consumer

business with established financial institutions, with the
    substantial majority of these financial institutions having
    credit ratings of “A−” or better from a major
    credit rating agency. The Company executes global business
    payments derivatives, as a result of its acquisition of Custom
    House, mostly with small and medium size enterprises. The credit
    risk inherent in both the

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments agreements represents the
    possibility that a loss may occur from the nonperformance of a
    counterparty to the agreements. The Company performs a review of
    the credit risk of these counterparties at the inception of the
    contract and on an ongoing basis. The Company also monitors the
    concentration of its contracts with any individual counterparty.
    The Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to
    fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements, but takes
    action (including termination of contracts) when doubt arises
    about the counterparties’ ability to perform. The
    Company’s hedged foreign currency exposures are in liquid
    currencies, consequently there is minimal risk that appropriate
    derivatives to maintain the hedging program would not be
    available in the future.

Foreign

Currency—Consumer-to-Consumer

The Company’s policy is to use longer-term foreign currency
    forward contracts, with maturities of up to 36 months at
    inception and a targeted weighted-average maturity of
    approximately one year, to mitigate some of the risk that
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the
    United States dollar could have on forecasted revenues
    denominated in other currencies related to its business. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company’s longer-term foreign
    currency forward contracts had maturities of a maximum of
    24 months with a weighted-average maturity of approximately
    one year. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges
    of forecasted revenue, with effectiveness assessed based on
    changes in the spot rate of the affected currencies during the
    period of designation.



Accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the hedges not
    considered effective or portions of the hedge that are excluded
    from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in
    “Derivative losses, net” within the Company’s
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company also uses short duration foreign currency forward
    contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one
    month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on
    settlement assets and obligations between initiation and
    settlement. In addition, forward contracts, typically with
    maturities of less than one year, are utilized to offset foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated cash positions. None of these contracts are
    designated as accounting hedges.

The aggregate equivalent United States dollar notional amounts
    of foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31,
    2010 were as follows (in millions):

Foreign
    Currency—Global Business Payments

As a result of the acquisition of Custom House, the Company
    writes derivatives, primarily foreign currency forward contracts
    and, to a much smaller degree, option contracts, mostly with
    small and medium size enterprises (customer contracts) and
    derives a currency spread from this activity as part of its
    global business payments operations. In this capacity, the
    Company facilitates cross-currency payment transactions for its
    customers but aggregates its Business Solutions foreign currency
    exposures arising from customer contracts, including the
    derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting
    net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with
    established financial institution counterparties (economic hedge
    contracts). The derivatives written are part of the broader
    portfolio of foreign currency positions arising from its
    cross-currency

business-to-business

payments operation, which includes significant spot exchanges of
    currency in addition to forwards and options. None of these
    contracts are designated as accounting hedges. The duration of
    these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less.

The aggregate equivalent United States dollar notional amounts
    of foreign currency derivative customer contracts held by the
    Company as of December 31, 2010 were approximately
    $1.5 billion. The significant majority of customer
    contracts are written in major currencies such as the Canadian
    dollar, euro, Australian dollar and the British pound.

The Company has a forward contract to offset foreign exchange
    rate fluctuations on a Canadian dollar denominated intercompany
    loan in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Custom
    House. This contract, which is not designated as an accounting
    hedge, had a notional amount of approximately 245 million
    and 230 million Canadian dollars at December 31, 2010
    and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Interest
    Rate Hedging—Corporate

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to effectively change
    the interest rate payments on a portion of its notes from
    fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate
    payments in order to manage its overall exposure to interest
    rates. The Company designates these derivatives as fair value
    hedges utilizing the short-cut method, which permits an
    assumption of no ineffectiveness if certain criteria are met.
    The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps is offset by
    a change in the carrying value of the debt being hedged within
    the Company’s “Borrowings” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and “Interest expense” in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income has been adjusted to include
    the effects of interest accrued on the swaps.



The Company, at times, utilizes derivatives to hedge the
    forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. These derivatives are
    designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the fixed
    rate coupon of the debt expected to be issued. The effective
    portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is
    recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”
    Such derivatives were used in connection with the 2010 issuances
    discussed in Note 15.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company held interest
    rate swaps in an aggregate notional amount of
    $1,195 million and $750 million, respectively. Of this
    aggregate notional amount held at December 31, 2010,
    $695 million related to notes due in 2011 and
    $500 million related to notes due in 2014.

The aggregate fair value of the Company’s long-term debt,

    related interest rate swaps, was $3,473.6 million and
    $3,211.3 million at December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, respectively.

The Company’s maturities of borrowings at par value as of
    December 31, 2010 are $700 million in November 2011,
    $500 million in 2014 and $2.1 billion beyond 2015.

The Company’s obligations with respect to its outstanding
    borrowings, as described below, rank equally.



Commercial
    Paper Program

On November 3, 2006, the Company established a commercial
    paper program pursuant to which the Company may issue unsecured
    commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”)
    in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any
    time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on the
    Revolving Credit Facility as described below. The Commercial
    Paper Notes may have maturities of up to 397 days from date
    of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market
    rates at the time of issuance. The Company had no commercial
    paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Revolving
    Credit Facility

On September 27, 2006, the Company entered into a five-year
    unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a
    $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a
    $250.0 million letter of credit

sub-facility

and a $150.0 million swing line

sub-facility

(the “Revolving Credit Facility”). On
    September 28, 2007, the Company entered into an amended and
    restated credit agreement, the primary purpose of which was to
    extend the maturity by one year from its original five-year
    $1.5 billion facility entered into in 2006. No other
    material changes were made in the amended and restated facility.
    The Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a
    group of 15 participating institutions, is used to meet
    additional liquidity needs that might arise for the Company and
    to support borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper
    program. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain
    covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the
    ability of the Company and other significant subsidiaries to
    grant certain types of security interests, incur debt or enter
    into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company is also
    required to maintain compliance with a consolidated interest
    coverage ratio covenant.

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for
    the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms
    of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a
    selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of
    19 basis points. A facility fee of 6 basis points on
    the total facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of
    usage. The facility fee percentage is determined based on
    certain of the Company’s credit ratings. In addition, to
    the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the
    Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related aggregate
    commitments, a utilization fee of 5 basis points as of
    December 31, 2010 based upon such ratings is payable to the
    lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings.

As of and during the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    Company had $1.5 billion available to borrow, as the
    Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit
    Facility.

Term
    Loan

On December 5, 2008, the Company entered into a senior,
    unsecured,

364-day

term
    loan in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million with
    a syndicate of lenders. The Term Loan was paid and financed with
    the issuance of the 2014 Notes on February 26, 2009.

Notes

On June 21, 2010, the Company issued $250.0 million of
    aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21,
    2040. Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable
    semiannually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the
    fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. The 2040 Notes are
    subject to covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict
    the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to
    grant certain types of security interests or enter into sale and
    leaseback transactions. The Company may redeem the 2040 Notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price
    based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.

On March 30, 2010, the Company exchanged
    $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2011
    Notes for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020. Interest with
    respect to the 2020 Notes is payable semiannually on April 1 and
    October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate
    of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were
    given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated
    market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As
    this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this
    premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along
    with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be
    accreted into interest expense over the life of the notes. The
    2020 Notes are subject to covenants that, among other things,
    limit or restrict



the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to
    grant certain types of security interests, incur debt (in the
    case of significant subsidiaries), or enter into sale and
    leaseback transactions. The Company may redeem the 2020 Notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price
    based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points.

The 2020 Notes were originally issued in reliance on exemptions
    from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). On
    October 8, 2010, the Company exchanged the 2020 Notes for
    notes registered under the Securities Act, pursuant to the terms
    of the Registration Rights Agreement.

On February 26, 2009, the Company issued $500 million
    of aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes to repay the
    balance of the Term Loan which was scheduled to mature in
    December 2009. Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is
    payable semiannually on February 26 and August 26 each year
    based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.500%. The 2014
    Notes are subject to covenants that, among other things, limit
    or restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its
    subsidiaries to grant certain types of security interests or
    enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may
    redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the
    greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate
    plus 50 basis points.

On November 17, 2006, the Company issued $2 billion of
    aggregate principal amount of the Company’s unsecured fixed
    and floating rate notes, comprised of $500 million
    aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Floating Rate
    Notes due 2008 (the “Floating Rate Notes”),
    $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.400% Notes
    due 2011 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.200% Notes due 2036 (the “2036 Notes”). The
    Floating Rate Notes were redeemed upon maturity in November 2008.

Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is
    payable semiannually on May 17 and November 17 each year based
    on fixed per annum interest rates of 5.400% and 6.200%,
    respectively. The 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes are subject to
    covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the
    ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to grant
    certain types of security interests, incur debt (in the case of
    significant subsidiaries), or enter into sale and leaseback
    transactions. The Company may redeem the 2011 Notes and the 2036
    Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a
    price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis
    points and 25 basis points, respectively.

On September 29, 2006, the Company issued $1.0 billion
    of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on
    October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable
    semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on a fixed
    per annum interest rate of 5.930%. The 2016 Notes are subject to
    covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the
    ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to grant
    certain types of security interests, incur debt (in the case of
    significant subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback
    transactions. The Company may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time
    prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the
    applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points.

    Compensation Plans

The
    Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan
    (“2006 LTIP”) provides for the granting of stock
    options, restricted stock awards and units, unrestricted stock
    awards and other equity-based awards to employees who perform
    services for the Company. A maximum of 120.0 million shares
    of common stock may be awarded under the 2006 LTIP, of which
    36.2 million shares are available as of December 31,
    2010.

Options granted under the 2006 LTIP are issued with exercise
    prices equal to the fair value of Western Union common stock on
    the grant date, have

10-year

terms, and vest over four equal annual increments beginning
    12 months after the date of grant. Compensation expense
    related to stock options is recognized over the requisite
    service period. The requisite service period for stock options
    is the same as the vesting period, with the exception of
    retirement eligible employees, who have shorter requisite
    service periods ending when the employees become retirement
    eligible.



Restricted stock awards and units granted under the 2006 LTIP
    typically become 100% vested on the three year anniversary of
    the grant date. The fair value of the awards granted is measured
    based on the fair value of the shares on the date of grant.
    Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of
    dividend equivalents. For those grants, the value of the grants
    is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend
    equivalent payments. The related compensation expense is
    recognized over the requisite service period which is the same
    as the vesting period.

In February 2009, the Compensation Committee of the
    Company’s board of directors granted the Company’s
    executives long-term incentive awards under the 2006 LTIP which
    consisted of one-third restricted stock units, one-third stock
    option awards and one-third performance-based cash awards. The
    performance-based cash awards are based on strategic performance
    objectives for 2009 and 2010 and are payable in equal
    installments on the second and third anniversaries of the award,
    assuming the applicable performance objectives are satisfied.
    Based on their contributions to the Company and additional
    assumed responsibilities, certain executives received an
    incremental grant of restricted stock units which fully vest on
    the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Additionally,
    non-executive employees of the Company participating in the 2006
    LTIP received annual equity grants of 50% stock option awards
    and 50% restricted stock units.

The
    Western Union Company 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity
    Compensation Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity
    Compensation Plan (“2006 Director Plan”) provides
    for the granting of equity-based awards to non-employee
    directors of the Company. Options granted under the
    2006 Director Plan are issued with exercise prices equal to
    the fair value of Western Union common stock at the grant date,
    have

10-year

terms, and vest immediately. Since options and deferred stock
    units under this plan vest immediately, compensation expense is
    recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of the
    awards when granted. Awards under the plan may be settled
    immediately unless the participant elects to defer the receipt
    of the common shares under applicable plan rules. A maximum of
    1.5 million shares of common stock may be awarded under the
    2006 Director Plan. As of December 31, 2010, the
    Company has issued 0.7 million options and 0.2 million
    unrestricted stock units to non-employee directors of the
    Company.

Impact
    of Spin-Off to Stock—Based Awards Granted Under First Data
    Plans

At the time of the Spin-off, First Data converted stock options,
    restricted stock awards and restricted stock units
    (collectively, “Stock-Based Awards”) of First Data
    stock held by Western Union and First Data employees. For
    Western Union employees, each outstanding First Data Stock-Based
    Award was converted to new Western Union Stock-Based Awards. For
    First Data employees, each outstanding First Data Stock-Based
    Award held prior to the Spin-off was converted into one
    replacement First Data Stock-Based Award and one Western Union
    Stock-Based Award. The new Western Union and First Data
    Stock-Based Awards maintained their pre-conversion aggregate
    intrinsic values, and, in the case of stock options, their ratio
    of the exercise price per share to their fair value per share.

All converted Stock-Based Awards, which had not vested prior to
    September 24, 2007, were subject to the terms and
    conditions applicable to the original First Data Stock-Based
    Awards, including change of control provisions which required
    full vesting upon a change of control of First Data.
    Accordingly, upon the completion of the acquisition of First
    Data on September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of Kohlberg
    Kravis Roberts & Co.’s (“KKR”), all of
    these remaining converted unvested Western Union Stock-Based
    Awards vested. As a result of this accelerated vesting, there is
    no remaining unamortized compensation expense associated with
    such converted Stock-Based Awards.

After the Spin-off, the Company receives all cash proceeds
    related to the exercise of all Western Union stock options,
    recognizes all stock compensation expense and retains the
    resulting tax benefits relating to Western Union awards held by
    Western Union employees. First Data recognizes all stock-based
    compensation expense and retains all associated tax benefits for
    Western Union Stock-Based Awards held by First Data employees.

Expected volatility

—For the Company’s board of
    directors and executives, the expected volatility for the 2010,
    2009 and 2008 grants was 32.8%, 46.9% and 31.3%, respectively.
    The expected volatility for the Company’s non-executive
    employees was 34.5%, 46.0% and 31.9% for the 2010, 2009 and 2008
    grants, respectively. The Company used a blend of implied and
    historical volatility. The Company’s implied volatility was
    calculated using the market price of traded options on Western
    Union’s common stock. In 2010 and 2009, the historical
    volatility represented a blend of Western Union and First Data
    (prior to the Spin-off) stock data. In 2008, the historical
    volatility also included a peer group of companies in similar
    industries

and/or

market capitalizations.

Expected dividend yield

—The Company’s expected
    annual dividend yield is the calculation of the annualized
    Western Union dividend divided by an average Western Union stock
    price on each respective grant date. The 2010 and 2009 grants do
    not reflect the increase in dividends approved by the Board of
    Directors on December 8, 2010 and December 9, 2009,
    respectively, as all 2010 and 2009 grants were issued prior to
    that date.

Expected term

—For 2010, Western Union’s
    expected term was 5.2 years for non-executive employees and
    6.8 years for the board of directors and executives. For
    2009, Western Union’s expected term was 5.0 years for
    non-executive employees and 6.7 years for the board of
    directors and executives. For 2008, Western Union’s
    expected term was 5.8 years for non-executive employees and
    7.5 years for the board of directors and executives. The
    Company’s expected term of options was based upon, among
    other things, historical exercises (including the exercise
    history of First Data’s awards), the vesting term of the
    Company’s options and the options’ contractual term of
    ten years.



Risk-free interest rate

—The risk-free rate for stock
    options granted during the period is determined by using a
    United States Treasury rate for the period that coincided with
    the expected terms listed above.

The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options
    granted will be evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect
    market conditions and the Company’s historical experience
    and future expectations. The calculated fair value is recognized
    as compensation cost in the Company’s financial statements
    over the requisite service period of the entire award.
    Compensation cost is recognized only for those options expected
    to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant and
    evaluated and adjusted periodically to reflect the
    Company’s historical experience and future expectations.
    Any change in the forfeiture assumption will be accounted for as
    a change in estimate, with the cumulative effect of the change
    on periods previously reported being reflected in the financial
    statements of the period in which the change is made. In the
    future, as more historical data is available to calculate the
    volatility of Western Union stock and the actual terms Western
    Union employees hold options, expected volatility and expected
    term may change which could change the grant-date fair value of
    future stock option awards and, ultimately, the recorded
    compensation expense.

17.

Segments

As previously described in Note 1, the Company classifies
    its businesses into two reportable segments:

consumer-to-consumer

and global business payments. Operating segments are defined as
    components of an enterprise that engage in business activities,
    about which separate financial information is available that is
    evaluated regularly by the Company’s CODM in deciding where
    to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

The

consumer-to-consumer

reporting segment is viewed as one global network where a money
    transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the
    world. The segment consists of three regions, which primarily
    coordinate agent network management and marketing activities.
    The CODM makes decisions regarding resource allocation and
    monitors performance based on specific corridors within and
    across these regions, but also reviews total revenue and
    operating profit of each region. These regions frequently
    interact on transactions with consumers and share processes,
    systems and licenses, thereby constituting one global

consumer-to-consumer

money transfer network. The regions and corridors generally
    offer the same services distributed by the same agent network,
    have the same types of customers, are subject to similar
    regulatory requirements, are processed on the same system and
    have similar economic characteristics, allowing the geographic
    regions to be aggregated into one reporting segment.

The global business payments segment processes payments from
    consumers or businesses to other businesses. The results of the
    Company’s existing

consumer-to-business

operations as well as the acquired Custom House business have
    been combined in this segment as both are focused on
    facilitating payments. For further information on Custom House,
    now referred to as Western Union Business Solutions, see
    Note 4.

All businesses that have not been classified into

consumer-to-consumer

or global business payments are reported as “Other.”
    These businesses primarily include the Company’s money
    order services businesses.

The Company’s reportable segments are reviewed separately
    below because each reportable segment represents a strategic
    business unit that offers different products and serves
    different markets. The business segment measurements provided
    to, and evaluated by, the Company’s CODM are computed in
    accordance with the following principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments
    primarily based on a percentage of the segments’ revenue
    compared to total revenue.

•

Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions
    are included in “Other.”

•

Restructuring and related expenses of $59.5 million and
    $82.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2008, respectively, were not allocated to the segments. The
    Company did not incur any material restructuring and related
    expenses in the year ended December 31, 2009. While these
    items were identifiable to the Company’s segments, they
    were not included in the measurement of segment operating



profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment
    performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on restructuring and
    related activities refer to Note 3.

•

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and
    settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. The
    agreement and settlement includes resolution of all outstanding
    legal issues and claims with the State and a multi-state
    agreement to fund a

not-for-profit

organization promoting safety and security along the United
    States and Mexico border. While this item was identifiable to
    the Company’s

consumer-to-consumer

segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment
    operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing
    segment performance and decision making with respect to resource
    allocation. For additional information on the settlement
    accrual, refer to Note 6.

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded.



The following table presents the Company’s reportable

The geographic split of revenue above for

consumer-to-consumer

is based upon the country where a money transfer is initiated
    and the country where a money transfer is paid with revenue
    being split 50% between the two countries. The geographic split
    of revenue above for global business payments is based upon the
    country where the transaction is initiated with 100% of the
    revenue allocated to that country. Long-lived assets, consisting
    of “Property and equipment, net,” are presented based
    upon the location of the assets.

A significant majority of the Company’s

consumer-to-consumer

transactions involve at least one

non-United

States location. Based on the method used to attribute revenue
    between countries described in the paragraph above, each
    individual country outside the United States accounted for less
    than 10% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008. In addition, each individual agent or global
    business payments customer accounted for less than 10% of
    revenue during these periods.

CONDENSED
    FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE REGISTRANT

THE
    WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO
    CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Basis of
    Presentation

The Western Union Company (the “Parent”) is a holding
    company that conducts substantially all of its business
    operations through its subsidiaries. Under a parent company only
    presentation, the Parent’s investments in its consolidated
    subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of
    accounting, and the condensed financial statements do not
    present the financial statements of the Parent and its
    subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial statements
    should be read in conjunction with The Western Union
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2.

Restricted
    Net Assets

Certain assets of the Parent’s subsidiaries totaling
    approximately $210 million constitute restricted net
    assets, as there are legal or regulatory limitations on
    transferring such assets outside of the countries where the
    respective assets are located, or because they constitute
    undistributed earnings of affiliates of the Parent accounted for
    under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31,
    2010, the Parent is in a stockholders’ equity position of
    $582.7 million, and as such, the restricted net assets of
    the Parent’s subsidiaries currently exceeds 25% of the
    consolidated net assets of the Parent and its subsidiaries, thus
    requiring this Schedule I, “Condensed Financial
    Information of the Registrant.”

3.

Related
    Party Transactions

Excess cash generated from operations of the Parent’s
    subsidiaries that is not required to meet certain regulatory
    requirements is paid periodically to the Parent and is reflected
    as “Payable to subsidiaries, net” in the Condensed
    Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010. The Parent’s
    subsidiaries periodically distribute excess cash balances to the
    Parent in the form of a dividend, although the amounts of such
    dividends may vary from year to year.

The Parent files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax
    return, and also a number of consolidated state income tax
    returns on behalf of its subsidiaries. In these circumstances,
    the Parent is responsible for remitting income tax payments on
    behalf of the consolidated group. The Parent’s provision
    for income taxes has been computed as if it were a separate
    tax-paying entity.

4.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Parent had $3.4 million in outstanding letters of
    credit and bank guarantees, including parental guarantees for
    subsidiaries, at December 31, 2010 with expiration dates
    through 2012, the majority of which contain a one-year renewal
    option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily
    held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent
    agreements. The Company expects to renew the letters of credit
    and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances.



ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
    FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation
    of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
    Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our controls and
    procedures related to our reporting and disclosure obligations
    as of December 31, 2010, which is the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and
    Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed by us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, in the
    reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported, as applicable, within the
    time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
    and Exchange Commission, and are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
    we file or submit are accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our Principal Executive Officer and
    Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management’s report on Western Union’s internal
    control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and the related
    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, are set
    forth under Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

On May 25, 2010 and as subsequently revised, our Board of
    Directors approved a restructuring plan including the
    elimination and relocation of employees who, among other
    functions, staffed certain of our operational accounting, IT and
    other functions. Accordingly, we will experience significant
    turnover in these areas during the transition of these
    operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party
    providers. Management believes it is taking the necessary steps
    to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls during
    this period of change.

There has not been any change in our internal control over
    financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal controls over financial
    reporting.

ITEM 9B.

OTHER
    INFORMATION
