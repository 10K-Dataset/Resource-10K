ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Overview

The Western Union Company (the "Company," "Western Union," "we," "our" or "us") is a leader in global money movement and payment services, providing people and businesses with fast, reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments around the world. The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data Corporation ("First Data") on February 17, 2006, and on September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (the "Spin-off").

The Western Union

®

brand is globally recognized and represents speed, reliability, trust and convenience. As people move and travel around the world, they are able to use the services of a well-recognized brand to transfer funds. Our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer service enables people to send money around the world, usually within minutes. As of

December 31, 2014

, our services were available through a global network of over

500,000

agent locations in

more than 200 countries and territories

, with

approximately 90%

of those locations outside of the United States. Each location in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services, with the majority offering a Western Union branded service. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately 70% of our locations had experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months.

We also provide consumers with flexible and convenient options for making one-time or recurring payments in our Consumer-to-Business segment. This segment primarily consists of United States bill payments and Pago Fácil (bill payments in Argentina).

The Business Solutions segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The majority of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at the spot rate, which enables customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments.

We believe that brand strength, size and reach of our global network, convenience, reliability and value for the price paid for our customers have been important to the growth of our business. As we continue to seek to meet the needs of our customers for fast, reliable and convenient global money movement and payment services, we are also working to enhance our services and provide our consumer and business clients with access to an expanding portfolio of payment and other financial services and to expand the ways our services can be accessed.

Our Segments

We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our three segments addresses a different combination of customer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as "Other" and include our money order and other services, in addition to costs for the review and closing of acquisitions.



The table below presents the components of our consolidated revenue:

No individual country outside the United States accounted for more than approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, and Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

See Part I, Item 1A,

Risk Factors,

for a discussion of certain risks relating to our foreign operations.

Consumer-to-Consumer Segment

Individual money transfers from one consumer to another are the core of our business, representing

80%

of our total consolidated revenues for


. We view our money transfer service as one interconnected global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the world. The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are limited to generating, managing and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities, and also includes online money transfer services conducted through Western Union branded websites ("westernunion.com"). By means of common processes and systems, these regions and westernunion.com create an interconnected network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one global Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment.

Although most remittances are sent from one of our agent locations worldwide, in some countries we offer the ability to  initiate transactions through websites, mobile devices, and account-based money transfers. All agent locations accept cash to initiate a transaction, and some also accept debit cards. We offer consumers several options to receive a money transfer. While the vast majority of transfers are paid in cash at agent locations, in some places we offer payout directly to the receiver's bank account, to a stored-value card, through the issuance of a money order, or at a small number of locations, through a check.

Operations

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from transaction fees charged to consumers to transfer money. In money transfers involving different send and receive currencies, we also generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire the currency.



In a typical money transfer transaction, a consumer goes to one of our agent locations, completes a form specifying, among other things, the name and address of the recipient, and delivers it, along with the principal amount of the money transfer and the fee, to the agent. In some jurisdictions, the agent collects the principal and fees after the presentation of a disclosure that generally identifies the exchange rate and all fees and charges associated with the transaction and the consumer has agreed to the transaction, as described in the disclosure. Certain of these processes are streamlined for our customers who participate in our loyalty programs. The sending agent enters the transaction information into our money transfer system and the funds are made available for payment, usually within minutes. The recipient generally enters an agent location in the designated receiving area or country, presents identification, where applicable, and is paid the transferred amount. Recipients generally do not pay a fee. However, in limited circumstances, a tax may be imposed by the local government on the receipt of the money transfer, or a fee may be charged by the receiver's institution related to the use of an account. We determine the fee paid by the sender, which generally is based on the principal amount of the transaction and the send and receive locations.

We generally pay our agents a commission based on a percentage of revenue. A commission is usually paid to both the agent that initiated the transaction, the "send agent," and the agent that paid the transaction, the "receive agent." For most agents, the costs of providing the physical infrastructure and staff are typically covered by the agent's primary business (e.g., postal services, banking, check cashing, travel and retail businesses), making the economics of being a Western Union agent attractive. Western Union's global reach and large consumer base allow us to attract agents we believe to be of high quality.

To complement the convenience offered by our network's global physical locations, in certain countries we have also made our services available through other channels, as described below under "Services."

No individual country outside the United States accounted for greater than 7% of this segment's revenue during all periods presented.

Services

We offer money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories. In


, the substantial majority of our Consumer-to-Consumer transactions were cash money transfers involving our walk-in agent locations around the world. Although demand for in-person, cash money transfers has historically been the strongest, we offer a number of options for sending and receiving funds that provide consumers convenience and choice. The different ways consumers can send or receive money include the following:

Walk-in and telephone money transfer service.

The substantial majority of our remittances constitute transactions in which cash is collected by the agent and payment (usually cash) is available for pick-up at another agent location, usually within minutes. In certain countries, we also offer convenience to our consumers to initiate a transaction through the phone using a debit or credit card or through our account based money transfer service, as described below. Additionally, in a few select markets, we offer consumers a lower-priced next day delivery service option for money transfers that do not need to be received within minutes.

Online money transfer service.

Western Union branded websites allow consumers to send funds online, including through mobile devices, generally using a credit or debit card for pay-out at most Western Union branded agent locations around the world. As of

December 31, 2014

, we were providing online money transfer service through Western Union branded websites in over 20 countries.

Account based money transfer service.

In certain countries, we offer services that allow consumers to initiate a money transfer from an account or direct a transfer to be received in an account. These services include allowing consumers to initiate a Western Union money transfer electronically through their bank’s internet banking service or automated teller machines (“ATMs”), without having to visit a physical Western Union agent location. Also, in certain countries, receivers can choose to be paid through credit to their accounts, and in the United States and other countries we provide a "Direct to Bank" service, enabling a consumer to send a transaction from an agent location or our websites into an account in a number of countries.



Distribution and Marketing Channels

We offer our Consumer-to-Consumer service to consumers around the world primarily through our global network of third-party agents in most countries and territories, with

approximately 90%

of our agent locations being located outside of the United States. Our agents facilitate the global distribution and convenience associated with our brands, which in turn helps create demand for our services and helps us to recruit and retain agents. Western Union agents include large networks such as post offices, banks and retailers, and other established organizations and smaller independent retail locations that provide other consumer products and services. Many of our agents have multiple locations. No individual agent accounted for greater than 10% of the segment's revenue during all periods presented. Our agents know the markets they serve and work with our management to develop business plans for their markets. Many of our agents contribute financial resources to, or otherwise support, our efforts to market the business. Many agents operate in locations that are open outside of traditional banking hours, for example on nights and weekends. Our top 40 agents globally have been with us an average of approximately 19 years and in


, these long-standing agents were involved in transactions that generated approximately 60% of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue.

We provide our third-party agents with access to our multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems used to originate and pay money transfers. We continue to develop our network around the world to optimize send and receive corridors. Our systems and processes enable our agents to pay money transfers in more than 130 currencies worldwide. Certain of our agents can pay in multiple currencies at a single location. Our agents provide the physical infrastructure and staff required to complete the transfers. Western Union provides central operating functions such as transaction processing, settlement, marketing support and customer relationship management to our agents, as well as compliance training and related support.

Some of our agents outside the United States manage subagents. We refer to these agents as superagents. Although the subagents are under contract with these superagents (and not with Western Union directly), the subagent locations typically have access to similar technology and services as our other agent locations.

Our international agents often customize services as appropriate for their geographic markets. In some markets, individual agents are independently offering specific services such as stored-value card payout options or Direct to Bank service. We market our services to consumers in a number of ways, directly and indirectly through our agent partners, leveraging promotional activities, grassroots and digital advertising, and loyalty programs. Our marketing benefits from feedback received from our agents and consumers.

Our marketing strategy includes our customer programs, such as "My WU

SM

" and "Gold Card," which are available in many countries and territories. These programs offer customers faster service at the point-of-sale. Additionally, in certain countries and at westernunion.com, customers can earn points which can be redeemed for rewards, such as reduced transaction fees or cash back; however, such redemption activity has been insignificant to the results of our operations.

Industry Trends

Trends in the cross-border money transfer business tend to correlate to migration trends, global economic opportunity and related employment levels worldwide. Another significant trend impacting the money transfer industry is increasing regulation. Regulations in the United States and elsewhere focus, in part, on anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist activities and consumer protection. Regulations require money transfer providers, banks and other financial institutions to develop systems to prevent, detect, monitor and report certain transactions. Such regulations increase the costs to provide money transfer services and can make it more difficult or less desirable for consumers and others to use money transfer services, either of which could have an adverse effect on money transfer providers' revenues and operating profits. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our business, see the "Regulation" discussion in this section, Part I, Item 1A,

Risk Factors,

and the "Enhanced Regulatory Compliance" section in Part II, Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

. Additionally, our ability to enter into or maintain exclusive arrangements with our agents has been and may continue to be challenged by both regulators and certain of our current and prospective agents, especially in certain inbound countries. Further, we are seeing increased competition from, and increased market acceptance of, electronic, mobile, and Internet-based money transfer services as well as digital currencies.



Competition

We face robust competition in the highly-fragmented Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer industry. We compete with a variety of remittance providers, including:

•

Global money transfer providers

-

Global money transfer providers allow consumers to send money to a wide variety of locations, in both their home countries and abroad.

•

Regional money transfer providers

- Regional money transfer providers, or "niche" providers, provide the same services as global money transfer providers, but focus on a smaller group of geographic corridors or services within one region, such as North America to the Caribbean, Central or South America, or Western Europe to North Africa.

•

Electronic channels

- Online money transfer service providers, including certain electronic payment providers, allow consumers to send and receive money electronically using the Internet or through mobile devices. Electronic channels also include digital wallets, digital currencies, and social media and other predominantly communication or commerce oriented platforms that offer money transfer services.

•

Banks and postbanks

- Banks and postbanks of all sizes compete with us in a number of ways, including bank wire services, payment instrument issuances, and card-based services.

•

Informal networks

- Informal networks enable people to transfer funds without formal mechanisms and often without compliance with government reporting requirements. We believe that such networks comprise a significant share of the market.

•

Alternative channels

- Alternative channels for sending and receiving money include mail and commercial courier services, and card-based options, such as ATM cards and stored-value cards.

We believe the most significant competitive factors in Consumer-to-Consumer remittances relate to the overall consumer value proposition, including brand recognition, trust, reliability, consumer experience, price, speed of delivery, distribution network and channel options.

Consumer-to-Business Segment

In our Consumer-to-Business segment, which represented

11%

of our total consolidated revenues for


, we provide fast and convenient options to make one-time or recurring payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. We believe our business customers who receive payments through our services benefit from their relationship with Western Union as it provides them with real-time or near real-time posting of their customers' payments. In many circumstances, our relationships with business customers also provide them with an additional source of income, as well as reduced expenses for cash and check handling.

Operations

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from transaction fees paid by the consumer. The transaction fees are typically less than the fees charged in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment. Consumers may make a cash payment at an agent or Company-owned location or may make an electronic payment over the phone or on the Internet using their credit or debit card, through the automated clearing house ("ACH") system, or via a wire transfer. Our Internet services are provided through our own websites or in partnership with other websites for which we act as the service provider. The significant majority of the segment's revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented, with the remainder primarily generated in Argentina.



Services

Our Consumer-to-Business payments services are available through a variety of services that give consumers choices as to the payment channel and method of payment, and include the following:

Speedpay

®

. Our Speedpay service is offered principally in the United States and allows consumers to make payments to a variety of businesses using credit cards, debit cards, ACH and in limited situations, checks. Payments are initiated over the phone or electronically through the Internet. We also partner with some businesses to allow their customers to access Speedpay from their websites.

Pago Fácil

®

. In South America, we offer walk-in, cash bill payment services which allow consumers to make payments for services such as phone, utilities and other recurring bills. In Argentina, we provide this service under the Pago Fácil brand, which constitutes the vast majority of our services in South America. We offer this service under the Western Union brand in Peru and Panama.

Western Union Payments.

The Western Union Payments service, which includes our Quick Collect

®

service, allows consumers to send funds to businesses and government agencies, primarily across the United States and Canada, using cash and, in certain locations, a debit card. This service is offered primarily at Western Union agent locations, but is provided via our westernunion.com website in limited situations. This service is also offered in select international locations under the service mark Quick Pay

SM

. We also offer Quick Cash

®

, a cash disbursement service used by businesses, government agencies, and financial institutions primarily to send money to employees or individuals with whom they have accounts or other business relationships. Consumers also use our Western Union Convenience Pay

®

("Convenience Pay") service to send payments by cash or check from a smaller number of Convenience Pay agent locations primarily to utilities and telecommunication providers.

Distribution and Marketing Channels

Our electronic consumer payment services are available primarily through the phone and online, including through certain mobile devices, while our cash-based consumer services are available through our agent networks and select Company-owned locations, primarily in South America.

Businesses market our services to consumers in a number of ways, and we market our services directly to consumers using a variety of means, including advertising materials, promotional activities, call campaigns and attendance at trade shows and seminars. Our Internet services are marketed to consumers on our websites, on the websites of our partners who offer our payment solutions or through co-branding arrangements with these partners.

We have relationships with over 15,000 consumer payments businesses to which consumers can make payments. These relationships are a core component of our payments services. No individual consumer or business accounted for greater than 10% of this segment's revenue during all periods presented.

Industry Trends

The payments industry has evolved with technological innovations that have created new methods of processing payments from consumers to businesses. The various services within the payments industry are in varying stages of development outside the United States. We believe that the United States is moving away from cash and paper checks for bill payments and moving toward electronic payment methods through the use of multiple technologies.



Competition

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers offering both cash and electronic-based payment solutions. Competition in electronic payment services includes financial institutions (which may offer consumer bill payment in their own name or may "host" payment services operated under the names of their clients) and other non-bank competitors. Competition for electronic payments also includes businesses offering their own or third-party services to their own customers and third-party providers of all sizes offering services directly to consumers. Competitors for cash payments include businesses that allow consumers to pay a bill at one of their locations, or at the location of a partner business, as well as mail and courier services. The ongoing trend away from cash-based bill payments in the United States and competitive pressures, which result in lower cash-based bill payment volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction services, continues to impact this business.

We believe the most significant competitive factors in this segment relate to customer service, trust and reliability, convenience, speed, price, variety of payment methods, biller relationships and service offerings, innovation, technology, and brand recognition.

Business Solutions Segment

In our Business Solutions segment, which represented

7%

of our total consolidated revenues for 2014, we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals.

Operations

The substantial majority of our revenue in this segment is derived from foreign exchange revenues, which are based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we are able to acquire the currency. Customers may make an electronic or wire transfer or remit a check in order to initiate a transaction. Our Internet services are provided through our own website and also in partnership with others. The significant majority of the segment's revenue was generated outside the United States during all periods presented.

Services

Business Solutions payment transactions are conducted through various channels including the phone and Internet. Payments are made predominately through electronic transfers, but in some situations, checks are remitted. The majority of Business Solutions' business relates to exchanges of currency at the spot rate, which enables customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments.

Distribution and Marketing Channels

Our business solutions services are primarily offered over the phone, through partner channels, and via the Internet. Our Internet services are marketed through co-branding arrangements with our website partners as well as on our own websites.

We have relationships with more than 100,000 customers with respect to our payment solutions. These relationships are a core component of our business payments services. No individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of this segment's revenue.

Industry Trends

The business-to-business payments industry has evolved with technological innovations that have created new methods of processing payments from businesses to other businesses. The various products and services within the business-to-business payments industry are in varying stages of development. We believe that the cross-border payments industry will expand in the future due to the expanding global focus of many businesses. Increased regulation and compliance requirements are trends also impacting the business-to-business payments industry, which will likely result in increased costs in this segment.



Competition

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers offering payment services and foreign exchange risk management solutions, including financial institutions and other non-bank competitors. We believe the most significant competitive factors in this segment relate to recurring relationships founded on customer service and expertise in payments and foreign exchange, customized solutions for specific industries and clients, convenience and speed of payments network, availability of derivative products, variety of inbound and outbound payment methods, brand recognition and price.

Other

Our remaining businesses, including our money order services, are grouped in the "Other" category, in addition to costs for the review and closing of acquisitions.

Customers use our money orders for making purchases, paying bills, and as an alternative to checks. We derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities.

Intellectual Property

The Western Union logos, trademarks, service marks and trade dress are registered and/or used worldwide and are material to our Company. The WU

®

service mark and logos are also registered and used in many countries around the world. We offer money transfer services under the Western Union, Orlandi Valuta

SM

and Vigo

®

brands. We also provide various payment and other services such as Western Union Payments, Quick Collect, Convenience Pay, Quick Pay, Quick Cash, Speedpay, Pago Fácil (registered in Argentina), and Western Union Business Solutions.

Our operating results over the past several years have allowed us to invest significantly each year to support our brands. In


, we invested approximately $210 million to market, advertise and promote our brands and services, including costs of dedicated marketing personnel. Many of our agents have also contributed significant financial resources to assist with marketing our services.

We own patents and patent applications covering various aspects of our processes and services. We have been, are and in the future may be, subject to claims and suits alleging that our technology or business methods infringe patents owned by others, both in and out of the United States. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could require us to change how we deliver services, result in significant financial consequences, or both, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Risk Management

Our Company has a credit risk management department that evaluates and monitors our credit and fraud risks. We are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment and money order settlement process. We also are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our online services and electronic channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash, and therefore are subject to "chargebacks," insufficient funds, or other collection impediments, such as fraud, which are anticipated to increase as online services and electronic channels become a greater proportion of our money transfer business. Our credit risk management team monitors fraud risks jointly with our information security and global compliance departments. Our credit risk management team also performs a credit review before each agent signing and conducts periodic analyses.

We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers. For the derivatives, the duration of these contracts at inception is generally less than one year. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. For those receivables where we have offered trade credit, collection ordinarily occurs within a few days. To mitigate risk associated with potential customer defaults, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis, and, for our derivatives, we may require certain customers to post or increase collateral.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market fund investments, derivatives and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions.

A key component of the Western Union business model is our ability to manage financial risk associated with conducting transactions worldwide. We settle with the majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of money transfer transactions are paid by the next day after they are initiated and agent settlements occur within a few days in most instances. We also utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts, to mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations and to provide predictability of future cash flows. We have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management due to the nature of our Business Solutions business. The majority of this business' revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency payments. Business Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties.

Our financial results may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest-bearing assets as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions.



International Investment

No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes on certain of our outside tax basis differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately

$5.6 billion

as of

December 31, 2014

, as we have reinvested and expect to continue to reinvest these earnings outside the United States indefinitely. Over the last several years, such earnings have been used to pay for our international acquisitions and operations and provide initial Company funding of global principal payouts for Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions transactions. However, if we are unable to utilize accumulated earnings outside of the United States and we repatriate these earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to significant United States federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.

Regulation

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by the United States federal government, each of the states, many localities and many other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union. These include an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. These also include laws and regulations regarding: financial services, consumer disclosure and consumer protection, currency controls, money transfer and payment instrument licensing, payment services, credit and debit cards, electronic payments, foreign exchange hedging services and the sale of spot, forward and option currency contracts, unclaimed property, the regulation of competition, consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Failure by Western Union, our agents, or their subagents (agents and subagents are third parties, over whom Western Union has limited legal and practical control) to comply with any of these requirements or their interpretation could result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to provide money transfer services and/or payment services or foreign exchange products, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, loss of consumer confidence, private class action litigation, the seizure of our assets, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines and restrictions on our ability to offer services.

We have developed and continue to enhance our global compliance programs, including our anti-money laundering program comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal controls to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, we continue to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current and evolving legal standards and industry practices, including heightened regulatory focus on compliance with anti-money laundering or fraud prevention requirements. As of December 31, 2014, these programs included approximately 1,900 dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring programs, suspicious activity reporting, regulatory outreach and education, and support and guidance to our agent network on regulatory compliance. Our money transfer and payment service networks operate through third-party agents in most countries, and, therefore, there are limitations on our legal and practical ability to completely control those agents' compliance activities. In


, the Company spent over $180 million on its compliance and regulatory programs, including costs related to our amended settlement agreement with the State of Arizona.

Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing and Regulation

Most of our services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the "BSA"), and similar state laws and regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money transfer companies and the issuers and sellers of money orders, to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, to report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information about consumers who use their services and maintain other transaction records. Many states impose similar and, in some cases, more stringent requirements. These requirements also apply to our agents and their subagents. In addition, the United States Department of the Treasury has interpreted the BSA to require money transfer companies to conduct due diligence into and risk-based monitoring of their agents inside and outside the United States, and certain states also require money transfer companies to conduct due diligence reviews of their agents and subagents. Compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations continues to be a focus of regulatory attention, with recent agreements being reached with Western Union, other money transfer providers and several large financial institutions.



Economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the United States Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") and by certain foreign jurisdictions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or dealings with) certain countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We provide very limited money transfer and payments services to individuals in Cuba, Syria and Sudan in accordance with United States laws authorizing such services and pursuant to and as authorized by advisory opinions of, or specific or general licenses granted by, OFAC.

In the United States, almost all states license certain of our services and many exercise authority over the operations of certain aspects of our business and, as part of this authority, regularly examine us. Many states require us to invest the principal of outstanding money orders, money transfers, or payments in highly-rated, investment grade securities, and our use of such investments is restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities in compliance with these regulations. The substantial majority of our investment securities, classified within "Settlement assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of "A-" or better from a major credit rating agency.

These licensing laws also cover matters such as government approval of controlling shareholders and senior management of our licensed entities, regulatory approval of agents and in some instances their locations, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee, and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain certain net worth levels. Many states also require money transfer providers and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations.

Outside of the United States, our money transfer business is subject to some form of regulation in all of the countries and territories in which we offer those services. These laws and regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services, agent registration requirements, limitations on the amount of principal that can be sent into or out of a country, limitations on the number of money transfers that may be sent or received by a consumer and controls on the rates of exchange between currencies. They also include laws and regulations intended to detect and prevent money laundering or terrorist financing, including obligations to collect and maintain information about consumers, recordkeeping, reporting and due diligence, and supervision of agents and subagents similar to and in some cases exceeding those required under the BSA. In most countries, either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer services.

The Payment Services Directive ("PSD") in the European Union ("EU") and similar laws in other jurisdictions have imposed rules on payment service providers like Western Union. In particular, Western Union is responsible for the regulatory compliance of our agents and their subagents who are engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries. Thus, the costs to monitor our agents and the risk of adverse regulatory action against us because of the actions of our agents in those areas have increased. The majority of our EU business is managed through our Irish PSD subsidiary, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Under the PSD, we are subject to investment safeguarding rules and periodic examinations similar to those we are subject to in the United States. These rules have resulted in increased compliance costs and may lead to increased competition in our areas of service. Additional countries may adopt legislation similar to these laws. The PSD, as well as legislation in other countries such as Russia, has also allowed an increased number of non-bank entities to become money transfer agents, allowing Western Union and other money transfer providers to expand their agent networks in these countries but also resulting in increased competition.

On February 11, 2010, Western Union Financial Services, Inc. ("WUFSI"), a subsidiary of the Company, signed a settlement agreement ("Southwest Border Agreement"), which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required us to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. As part of the Southwest Border Agreement, we have made and expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor (the "Monitor") has been engaged for those programs. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the Southwest Border Agreement. The Monitor has made a number of recommendations related to our compliance programs, which we are implementing, including programs related to our Business Solutions segment. On January 31, 2014, the Southwest Border Agreement was amended to extend its term until December 31, 2017 (the "Amendment"). The Amendment imposes additional obligations on the Company and WUFSI in connection with WUFSI’s anti-money laundering compliance programs and cooperation with law enforcement. See Part I, Item 1A,

Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened supervision of money transfer providers and requiring increasing efforts to ensure compliance. As a result, we are experiencing increasing compliance costs related to customer, agent, and subagent due diligence, verification, transaction approval, disclosure, and reporting requirements, along with other requirements that have had and will continue to have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Government agencies both inside and outside the United States may impose new or additional rules on money transfers affecting us or our agents or their subagents, including regulations that:

•

prohibit transactions in, to or from certain countries or with certain governments, individuals and entities;

•

impose additional customer identification and customer, agent, and subagent due diligence requirements;

•

impose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements, or require enhanced transaction monitoring;

•

limit the types of entities capable of providing money transfer services, impose additional licensing or registration requirements on us, our agents, or their subagents, or impose additional requirements on us with regard to selection or oversight of our agents or their subagents;

•

impose minimum capital or other financial requirements on us or our agents and their subagents;

•

limit or restrict the revenue which may be generated from money transfers, including transaction fees and revenue derived from foreign exchange;

•

require enhanced disclosures to our money transfer customers;

•

require the principal amount of money transfers originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until they are paid;

•

limit the number or principal amount of money transfers which may be sent to or from the jurisdiction, whether by an individual, through one agent or in aggregate;

•

impose taxes or fees on money transfer transactions; and

•

restrict or limit our ability to process transactions using centralized databases, for example, by requiring that transactions be processed using a database maintained in a particular country.



Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Other Similar Legislation

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") became United States federal law in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") whose purpose is to implement, examine for compliance with and enforce federal consumer protection laws governing financial products and services, including money transfer services. The CFPB has created additional regulatory obligations for us and has the authority to examine and supervise us and our larger competitors. The CFPB's regulations implementing the remittance provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have affected our business in a variety of areas. These include: a requirement to provide almost all consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced, written, pre-transaction disclosures, including the disclosure of fees, foreign exchange rates and taxes, an obligation to resolve various errors, including certain errors that may be outside our control, and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a consumer's request. We have modified certain of our systems, business practices, service offerings or procedures to comply with these regulations. We also face liability for the failure of our money transfer agents and their subagents to comply with the rules and have implemented and are continuing to implement additional policies, procedures, and oversight measures designed to foster compliance by our agents. The extent of our, and our agents' implementation of these policies, procedures, and measures may be considered by the CFPB in any action or proceeding against us for noncompliance with the rules by our agents. The CFPB has also implemented a direct portal for gathering information regarding consumer complaints in the money transfer area. It is likely that this effort will lead to additional regulatory scrutiny.

Rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as the provisions of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and its technical standards, which are directly applicable in the member states of the European Union, have subjected most of our foreign exchange hedging transactions, including certain intercompany hedging transactions, certain of the corporate interest rate hedging transactions we may enter into in the future, and certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer as part of our Business Solutions segment, to reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements. Additionally, certain of the corporate interest rate hedging transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing and margin requirements and certain of our other transactions may become so in the future. Other jurisdictions outside of the United States and the European Union are considering, have implemented, or are implementing regulations similar to those described above. Derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements will result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our Business Solutions segment. For further discussion of these risks, see Part I, Item 1A,

Risk Factors

-

"

The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by that Act and the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and similar legislation and regulations enacted by other government authorities, could adversely affect us and the scope of our activities, and could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition

."

Unclaimed Property Regulations

Our Company is subject to unclaimed property laws in the United States and in certain other countries. These laws require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by our Company that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers and money orders. We hold property subject to unclaimed property laws and we have an ongoing program designed to help us comply with these laws. We are subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices.



Privacy Regulations and Information Security Standards

We must collect, transfer, disclose, use and store personal information in order to provide our services. These activities are subject to information security standards, data privacy, data breach and related laws and regulations in the United States and other countries. In the United States, data privacy and data breach laws such as the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws apply directly to a broad range of financial institutions including money transfer providers like Western Union, and indirectly to companies that provide services to or on behalf of those institutions. The United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has an on-going program of investigating the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many, resulting in multimillion dollar settlements and multi-year agreements governing the settling companies' privacy practices. The FTC, several states and data protection authorities in other countries have expanded their area of concern to include privacy practices related to online and mobile applications. Many state laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach of computer databases or physical documents that contain certain types of non-public personal information and present a risk for unauthorized use or potential harm.

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of personal information required to provide our services is subject to data privacy laws outside of the United States, such as laws adopted pursuant to the EU's 95/46 EC Directive of the European Parliament, and other national and provincial laws throughout the world. In some cases, these laws are more restrictive than the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and impose more stringent duties on companies. These laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. Under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach.

These regulations, laws and industry standards also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of internal data security standards, controls or guidelines. Western Union maintains and upgrades its systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets. For further discussion of these risks, see Part I, Item 1A,

Risk Factors

"

Breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

"

In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, Western Union makes information available to certain United States federal, state, and foreign government agencies when required by law. In recent years, Western Union has experienced increasing data sharing requests by these agencies, particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or reduce the risk of identity theft. During the same period, there has also been increased public attention to the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals - the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the individual's right to privacy - may conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we believe that Western Union is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose Western Union to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage.

Banking Regulation

We have subsidiaries that operate under banking licenses granted by the Austrian Financial Market Authority and the Brazilian Central Bank. We are also subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the New York State Department of Financial Services (the "Financial Services Department"), which has regulatory authority over our entity that holds all interests in these subsidiaries. Further, an Agreement of Supervision with the Financial Services Department imposes various regulatory requirements including operational limitations, capital requirements, affiliate transaction limitations, and notice and reporting requirements on this entity. However, because this entity and its subsidiaries do not exercise banking powers in the United States, we are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act in the United States.



Other

Some of our services are subject to card association rules and regulations. For example, an independent standards-setting organization, the Payment Card Industry ("PCI") Security Standards Council (including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa Inc. International) developed a set of comprehensive requirements concerning payment card account security through the transaction process, called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"). All merchants and service providers that store, process and transmit payment card data are required to comply with PCI DSS as a condition to accepting credit cards. We are subject to annual reviews to ensure compliance with PCI regulations worldwide and are subject to fines if we are found to be non-compliant.

Employees and Labor

As of December 31, 2014, our businesses employed approximately 10,000 employees, of which approximately 7,900 employees are located outside the United States.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Such risks are grouped according to:

•

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry;

•

Risks Related to Our Regulatory and Litigation Environment; and

•

Risks Related to the Spin-Off.

You should carefully consider all of these risks.

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

Global economic downturns or slower growth or declines in the money transfer, payment service, and other markets in which we operate, including downturns or declines related to interruptions in migration patterns, and difficult conditions in global financial markets and

financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial

condition and results of operations.

The global economy has experienced in recent years, and may experience, downturns, volatility and disruption, and we face certain risks relating to such events, including:

•

Demand for our services could soften, including due to low consumer confidence, high unemployment, or reduced global trade.

•

Our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business relies in large part on migration, which brings workers to countries with greater economic opportunities than those available in their native countries. A significant portion of money transfers are sent by international migrants. Migration is affected by (among other factors) overall economic conditions, the availability of job opportunities, changes in immigration laws, and political or other events (such as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that would make it more difficult for workers to migrate or work abroad. Changes to these factors could adversely affect our remittance volume and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

•

Many of our consumers work in industries that may be impacted by deteriorating economic conditions more quickly or significantly than other industries. Reduced job opportunities, especially in retail, healthcare, hospitality, and construction, or overall weakness in the world’s economies could adversely affect the number of money transfer transactions, the principal amounts transferred and correspondingly our results of operations. If general market softness in the economies of countries important to migrant workers occurs, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Additionally, if our consumer transactions decline, if the amount of money that consumers send per transaction declines, or if migration patterns shift due to weak or deteriorating economic conditions, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

•

Our agents or clients could experience reduced sales or business as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions. As a result, our agents could reduce their numbers of locations or hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether. Businesses using our services may make fewer cross-currency payments or may have fewer customers making payments to them through us, particularly businesses in those industries that may be more affected by an economic downturn.

•

Our Business Solutions business is heavily dependent on global trade. A downturn in global trade or the failure of long-term import growth rates to return to historic levels could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as customer hedging activity in our Business Solutions business generally varies with currency volatility, we have experienced and may experience in the future lower foreign exchange revenues in periods of lower currency volatility.

•

Our exposure to receivables from our agents, consumers and businesses could impact us. For more information on this risk, see risk factor,

"

We face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents, consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations

."



•

The market value of the securities in our investment portfolio may substantially decline. The impact of that decline in value may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

•

The counterparties to the derivative financial instruments that we use to reduce our exposure to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, may fail to honor their obligations, which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. This includes the exposure generated by the Business Solutions business, where we write derivative contracts to our customers as part of our cross-currency payments business, and we typically hedge the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. That failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness as it becomes due or we may have to refinance on unfavorable terms, which could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, and other purposes.

•

Our revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks is one source for funding liquidity needs and also backs our commercial paper program. If any of the banks participating in our credit facility fails to fulfill its lending commitment to us, our short-term liquidity and ability to support borrowings under our commercial paper program could be adversely affected.

•

The third-party service providers on whom we depend may experience difficulties in their businesses, which may impair their ability to provide services to us and have a potential impact on our own business. The impact of a change or temporary stoppage of services may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

•

Banks upon which we rely to conduct our business could fail or be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. This could lead to our inability to access funds and/or credit losses for us and could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.

•

Insurers we utilize to mitigate our exposures to litigation and other risks may be unable to or refuse to satisfy their obligations to us, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

•

If market disruption and volatility occurs, we could experience difficulty in accessing capital on favorable terms and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

We face competition from global and niche or corridor money transfer providers, United States and international banks, card associations, card-based payments providers and a number of other types of service providers, including electronic, mobile and Internet-based services, digital currencies and related protocols, and other innovations in technology and business models. Our future growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in the industry.

Money transfer and business payments are highly competitive industries which include service providers from a variety of financial and non-financial business groups. Our competitors include banks, credit unions, automated teller machine providers and operators, card associations, web-based services, payment processors, card-based payments providers such as issuers of e-money, travel cards or stored-value cards, informal remittance systems, phone payment systems (including mobile phone networks), postal organizations, retailers, check cashers, mail and courier services, currency exchanges, consumer money transfer companies, and digital currencies. These services are differentiated by features and functionalities such as brand recognition, customer service, trust and reliability, distribution network and channel options, convenience, price, speed, variety of payment methods, service offerings and innovation. Distribution network and channel options, such as the electronic money transfer service, which includes online, account based and mobile money transfer, have been and may continue to be impacted by increased competition, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Our future growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in money transfer and business payments. For example, if we fail to price our services appropriately, consumers may not use our services, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, we have historically implemented and will likely continue to implement price reductions from time to time in response to competition and other factors. Price reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently. Further, failure to compete on service differentiation and service quality could significantly affect our future growth potential and results of operations.

As noted below under risk factor

Risks associated with operations outside the United States and foreign currencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations

,

"

many of our agents outside the United States are national post offices. These entities are usually governmental organizations that may enjoy special privileges or protections that could allow them to simultaneously develop their own money transfer businesses. International postal organizations could agree to establish a money transfer network among themselves. Due to the size of these organizations and the number of locations they have, any such network could represent significant competition to us.

If customer confidence in our business or in consumer money transfer and payment service providers

generally deteriorates, our business, financial condition and results of operations

could be adversely affected.

Our business is built on customer confidence in our brands and our ability to provide fast, reliable money transfer and payment services. Erosion in customer confidence in our business, or in consumer money transfer and payment service providers as a means to transfer money, could adversely impact transaction volumes which would in turn adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A number of factors could adversely affect customer confidence in our business, or in consumer money transfer and payment service providers generally, many of which are beyond our control, and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. These factors include:

•

changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or regulator or judicial interpretation thereof that have the effect of making it more difficult or less desirable to transfer money using consumer money transfer and payment service providers, including additional customer due diligence, identification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements;

•

the quality of our services and our customer experience, and our ability to meet evolving consumer needs and preferences, including customer preferences related to our digital services;

•

failure of our agents or their subagents to deliver services in accordance with our requirements;

•

reputational concerns resulting from actual or perceived events, including those related to fraud or consumer protection;

•

actions by federal, state or foreign regulators that interfere with our ability to transfer consumers' money reliably, for example, attempts to seize money transfer funds, or limit our ability to or prohibit us from transferring money in certain corridors;

•

federal, state or foreign legal requirements, including those that require us to provide consumer or transaction data pursuant to our settlement agreement with the State of Arizona and other requirements or to a greater extent than is currently required;

•

any significant interruption in our systems, including by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or disruptions in our workforce; and

•

any breach of our computer systems or other data storage facilities resulting in a compromise of personal data.

Many of our money transfer consumers are migrants. Consumer advocacy groups or governmental agencies could consider migrants to be disadvantaged and entitled to protection, enhanced consumer disclosure, or other different treatment. If consumer advocacy groups are able to generate widespread support for actions that are detrimental to our business, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.



Our ability to adopt new technology and develop and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products and services in response to changing industry and regulatory standards and evolving customer needs poses a challenge to our business.

Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, with the constant introduction of new and enhanced products and services and evolving industry and regulatory standards and consumer needs and preferences. Our ability to enhance our current products and services and introduce new products and services that address these changes has a significant impact on our ability to be successful. We actively seek to respond in a timely manner to changes in customer (both consumer and business) needs and preferences, technology advances and new and enhanced products and services such as technology-based money transfer and Business Solutions payments services, including Internet, phone-based and other mobile money transfer services. Failure to respond well to these challenges on a timely basis could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, even if we respond well to these challenges, the business and financial models offered by many of these alternative, more technology-reliant means of money transfer and electronic payment solutions may be less advantageous to us than the model offered by our traditional cash/agent model or our current online money transfer model.

Risks associated with operations outside the United States and foreign currencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations

.

A substantial portion of our revenue is generated in currencies other than the United States dollar. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with changes in the value of our revenues and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. For example, a considerable portion of our revenue is generated in the euro. If we are unable to or elect not to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro against a significant devaluation, the value of our euro-denominated revenue, operating profit and net monetary assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into United States dollars for inclusion in our financial statements. Moreover, if we engage in foreign currency hedging activities, as it relates to our revenues, such transactions may help to mitigate the adverse financial effects of an appreciation in the United States dollar relative to other currencies. In an environment of a declining United States dollar relative to other currencies, such hedging transactions could have the effect of limiting the translation benefits on our reported financial results. In addition, our Business Solutions business provides currency conversion and, in certain countries, foreign exchange hedging services to its customers, further exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk. In order to mitigate these risks, we enter into derivative contracts. However, these contracts do not eliminate all of the risks related to fluctuating foreign currency rates.

We operate in almost all emerging markets throughout the world. In many of these markets, our foreign currency exposure is limited because most transactions are receive transactions and we reimburse our agents in either United States dollars or euros for the payment of these transactions. However, in certain of these emerging markets we generate revenue from send transactions. Our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in those markets is increased as these fluctuations impact our revenues and operating profits. Typically, in these markets the cost of hedging activities is prohibitive.

We have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our Business Solutions business. The majority of this business' revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency payments. In certain countries, this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers. The duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. Business Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. If we are unable to obtain offsetting positions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.



A substantial portion of our revenue is generated outside of the United States. Repatriating foreign earnings to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these earnings have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We utilize a variety of planning and financial strategies to help ensure that our worldwide cash is available where needed, including decisions related to the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is repatriated or otherwise made available from our international subsidiaries. Changes in the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is repatriated (or deemed repatriated) or otherwise made available from our international subsidiaries, including changes arising from new legal or tax rules, disagreements with legal or tax authorities concerning existing rules that are ultimately resolved in their favor, or changes in our operations or business, could result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to pay future dividends or make share repurchases. For further discussion regarding the risk that our future effective tax rates could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally, see risk factor

"

Changes in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense

"

below.

Money transfers and payments to, from, within, or between countries may be limited or prohibited by law. At times in the past, we have been required to cease operations in particular countries due to political uncertainties or government restrictions imposed by foreign governments or the United States. Occasionally agents or their subagents have been required by their regulators to cease offering our services, see risk factor

"

Regulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards affecting us, our agents or their subagents, or the banks with which we or our agents maintain bank accounts needed to provide our services could require changes in our business model and increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity

"

below. Additionally, economic or political instability or natural disasters may make money transfers to, from, within, or between particular countries difficult or impossible, such as when banks are closed, when currency devaluation makes exchange rates difficult to manage or when natural disasters or civil unrest makes access to agent locations unsafe. These risks could negatively impact our ability to offer our services, to make payments to or receive payments from international agents or our subsidiaries or our ability to recoup funds that have been advanced to international agents or are held by our subsidiaries, and as a result could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the general state of telecommunications and infrastructure in some lesser developed countries, including countries where we have a large number of transactions, creates operational risks for us and our agents that generally are not present in our operations in the United States and other more developed countries.

Many of our agents outside the United States are post offices, which are usually owned and operated by national governments. These governments may decide to change the terms under which they allow post offices to offer remittances and other financial services. For example, governments may decide to separate financial service operations from postal operations, or mandate the creation or privatization of a "post bank," which could result in the loss of agent locations, or they may require multiple service providers in their network. These changes could have an adverse effect on our ability to distribute or offer our services in countries that are material to our business.



Breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We collect, transfer and retain consumer, business, employee and agent data as part of our business. These activities are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions, see risk factor

"

Current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition

"

below. The requirements imposed by these laws and regulations, which often differ materially among the many jurisdictions, are designed to protect the privacy of personal information and  prevent that information from being inappropriately used or disclosed. We have developed and maintain technical and operational safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, despite those safeguards, it is possible that hackers, employees acting contrary to our policies or others could improperly access our systems or the systems of our business partners and service providers and improperly obtain or disclose data about our consumers, business customers, agents and/or employees. Further, because some data is collected and stored by third parties, it is possible that a third party could intentionally or inadvertently disclose personal data in violation of law. Also, in some jurisdictions we transfer data related to our employees, business customers, consumers, agents and potential employees to third-party vendors in order to perform due diligence and for other reasons. It is possible that a vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose such data. Any data breach resulting in a compromise of consumer, business, employee or agent data could require us to notify impacted individuals, and in some cases regulators, of a possible or actual breach, expose us to regulatory enforcement action, including fines, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation and/or damage our reputation.

Interruptions in our systems, including as a result of cyber attacks, or disruptions in our workforce may have a significant

effect on our business.

Our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer information systems and those of our service providers. Any significant interruptions could harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of consumers. These systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or other causes, many of which may be beyond our control or that of our service providers. Further, we have been and continue to be the subject of cyber attacks. These attacks are primarily aimed at interrupting our business, exposing us to financial losses, or exploiting information security vulnerabilities. Historically, none of these attacks or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in any material liability to us or any material damage to our reputation, and disruptions related to cybersecurity have not caused any material disruption to the Company's business, although there can be no assurance that a material breach will not occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to prevent systems disruptions, our measures may not be successful and we may experience problems other than system disruptions. We also may experience software defects, development delays, installation difficulties and other systems problems, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability which may not be fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Our data applications may not be sufficient to address technological advances, regulatory requirements, changing market conditions or other developments. In addition, any work stoppages or other labor actions by employees, the significant majority of which are located outside the United States, could adversely affect our business.



Acquisitions and integration of new businesses create risks and may affect operating

results.

We have acquired and may acquire businesses both inside and outside the United States. The acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks. The core risks involve valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence) and integration (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company's people, products and services, technology and other assets in an effort to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the projected synergies of the acquisition). In addition, the need in some cases to improve regulatory compliance standards is another risk associated with acquiring companies, see "Risks Related to Our Regulatory and Litigation Environment" below. Acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:

•

realizing the anticipated financial benefits from these acquisitions and where necessary, improving internal controls of these acquired businesses;

•

managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;

•

managing multi-jurisdictional operating, tax and financing structures;

•

integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;

•

integrating the acquired technologies into our Company;

•

complying with regulatory requirements;

•

enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;

•

entering new markets with the services of the acquired businesses; and

•

general economic and political conditions, including legal and other barriers to cross-border investment in general, or by United States companies in particular.

Integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or divert resources from, one or more of our businesses and could result in the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with an acquisition and the integration of the acquired company's operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

$3,169.2 million

of goodwill comprising approximately 32% of our total assets, including

$1,950.1 million

of goodwill in our Consumer-to-Consumer reporting unit and

$996.0 million

of goodwill in our Business Solutions reporting unit. For the Business Solutions reporting unit, a decline in estimated fair value of approximately 15% as of the October 1, 2014 testing date could occur before triggering an impairment of goodwill. If we or our reporting units do not generate operating cash flows at levels consistent with our expectations, we may be required to write down the goodwill on our balance sheet, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. See the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" discussion in Part II, Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

, for more detail.

We face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents, consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations

.

The vast majority of our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer and Consumer-to-Business activity is conducted through third-party agents that provide our services to consumers at their retail locations. These agents sell our services, collect funds from consumers and are required to pay the proceeds from these transactions to us. As a result, we have credit exposure to our agents. In some countries, our agent networks include superagents that establish subagent relationships; these agents must collect funds from their subagents in order to pay us. We are not insured against credit losses, except in certain circumstances related to agent theft or fraud. If an agent becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay money order, money transfer or payment services proceeds to us, we must nonetheless pay the money order, complete the money transfer or payment services on behalf of the consumer.



The liquidity of our agents is necessary for our business to remain strong and to continue to provide our services. If our agents fail to settle with us in a timely manner, our liquidity could be affected.

From time to time, we have made, and may in the future make, short-term advances and longer term loans to our agents. These advances and loans generally are secured by settlement funds payable by us to these agents. However, the failure of these borrowing agents to repay these advances and loans constitutes a credit risk to us.

We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. If a customer becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us, we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit.

We offer consumers in select countries the ability to transfer money utilizing their bank account or credit or debit card via the Internet and phone. These transactions have experienced and continue to experience a greater risk of fraud and higher fraud losses. Additionally, money transfers funded by ACH, or similar methods, are not preauthorized by the sender's bank and carry the risk that the account may not exist or have sufficient funds to cover the transaction. We apply verification and other tools to help authenticate transactions and protect against fraud. However, these tools are not always successful in protecting us against fraud. As the merchant of these transactions, we may bear the financial risk of the full amount sent in some of the fraudulent transactions. Issuers of credit and debit cards may also incur losses due to fraudulent transactions through our distribution channels and may elect to block transactions by their cardholders in these channels with or without notice. We may be subject to additional fees or penalties if the amount of chargebacks exceeds a certain percentage of our transaction volume. Such fees and penalties escalate over time if we do not take effective action to reduce chargebacks below the threshold, and if chargeback levels are not ultimately reduced to acceptable levels, our merchant accounts could be suspended or revoked, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

If we are unable to maintain our agent, subagent or global business relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place, including due to increased costs or loss of business as a result of increased compliance requirements or difficulty for us, our agents or their subagents in establishing or maintaining relationships with banks needed to conduct our services, or if our agents or their subagents fail to comply with Western Union business and technology standards and contract requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected

.

Most of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue is derived through our agent network. Some of our international agents have subagent relationships in which we are not directly involved. If, due to competition or other reasons, agents or their subagents decide to leave our network, or if we are unable to sign new agents or maintain our agent network under terms consistent with those currently in place, or if our agents are unable to maintain relationships with or sign new subagents, our revenue and profits may be adversely affected. Agent attrition might occur for a number of reasons, including a competitor engaging an agent, an agent's dissatisfaction with its relationship with us or the revenue derived from that relationship, an agent's or its subagents' unwillingness or inability to comply with our standards or legal requirements, including those related to compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, anti-fraud measures, or agent registration and monitoring requirements or increased costs or loss of business as a result of difficulty for us, our agents or their subagents in establishing or maintaining relationships with banks needed to conduct our services. For example, changes to our compliance-related practices as a result of our settlement agreement with the State of Arizona and changes to our business model, primarily related to our Vigo and Orlandi Valuta brands, resulted in the loss of over 7,000 agent locations in Mexico in 2012. In addition, agents may generate fewer transactions or less revenue for various reasons, including increased competition, political unrest, or changes in the economy, and the cost of maintaining agent or subagent locations has increased and may continue to increase because of enhanced compliance efforts. Because an agent is a third party that engages in a variety of activities in addition to providing our services, it may encounter business difficulties unrelated to its provision of our services, which could cause the agent to reduce its number of locations, hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether.



Changes in laws regulating competition or in the interpretation of those laws could undermine our ability to enter into or maintain our exclusive arrangements with our current and prospective agents. See risk factor

"

Regulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards affecting us, our agents or their subagents, or the banks with which we or our agents maintain bank accounts needed to provide our services could require changes in our business model and increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity

"

below. In addition, certain of our agents and subagents have refused to enter into exclusive arrangements. The inability to enter into exclusive arrangements or to maintain our exclusive rights in agent contracts in certain situations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations by, for example, allowing competitors to benefit from the goodwill associated with the Western Union brand at our agent locations.

We rely on our agents' information systems and/or processes to obtain transaction data. If an agent or their subagent loses information, if there is a significant disruption to the information systems of an agent or their subagent, or if an agent or their subagent does not maintain the appropriate controls over their systems, we may experience reputational and other harm which could result in losses to the Company.

In our Consumer-to-Business segment, we provide services for making one-time or recurring payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. For example, we have relationships with over 15,000 consumer payments businesses to which our customers can make payments. These relationships are a core component of our payments services, and we derive a substantial portion of our Consumer-to-Business revenue through these relationships. In Business Solutions, we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals, and we have relationships with more than 100,000 customers with respect to our payment solutions. Increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our services or by making it more cumbersome for businesses or consumers to do business with us. We have also had difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks’ policies. If we are unable to maintain our current business or banking relationships or establish new relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place, our ability to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by adverse

rating actions by credit rating agencies.

If our credit ratings are downgraded, or if they are placed under review or revised to have a negative outlook, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged, which could adversely affect our relationships with our agents, particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices, and our banking and other business relationships. In addition, an adverse credit rating by a rating agency, such as a downgrade or negative outlook, could result in regulators imposing additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Although our credit ratings have been downgraded in the past, we still maintain an investment grade rating. Also, a downgrade below investment grade will increase our interest expense under certain of our notes and any significant downgrade could increase our costs of borrowing money more generally or adversely impact or eliminate our access to the commercial paper market, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We receive services from third-party vendors that would be difficult to replace if

those vendors ceased providing such services adequately or at all. Cessation of or defects in various services provided to us by third-party vendors could cause temporary disruption

to our business.

Some services relating to our business, such as software application support, the development, hosting and maintenance of our operating systems, check clearing, and processing of returned checks are outsourced to third-party vendors, which would be difficult to replace quickly. If our third-party vendors were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future, our business and operations could be adversely affected.



We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from productivity and cost-savings and other related initiatives, which may include decisions to downsize or to transition operating activities from one location to another, and we may experience disruptions in our workforce as a result of those initiatives.

We have engaged in actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. We may implement additional initiatives in future periods. While these initiatives are designed to increase productivity and result in cost savings, there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits will be realized, and the costs to implement such initiatives may be greater than expected. In addition, these initiatives have resulted and will likely result in the loss of personnel, some of whom may support significant systems or operations. Consequently, these initiatives could result in a disruption to our workforce. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, or the costs to implement them are greater than expected, or if the actions result in a disruption to our workforce greater than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

There can be no guarantee that we will continue to make dividend payments or repurchase stock.

For risks associated with our ability to continue to make dividend payments or repurchase shares, please see Part II, Item 5,

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to protect our

brands and our other intellectual property rights and to defend ourselves against

potential intellectual property infringement claims.

The Western Union brand, which is protected by trademark registrations in many countries, is material to our Company. The loss of the Western Union trademark or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with the name would harm our business. Similar to the Western Union trademark, the Vigo, Orlandi Valuta, Speedpay, Pago Fácil, Western Union Payments, Quick Collect, Quick Pay, Convenience Pay, Western Union Business Solutions and other trademarks and service marks are also important to our Company and a loss of the service mark or trademarks or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with these names could harm our business.

Our intellectual property rights are an important element in the value of our business. Our failure to take appropriate actions against those who infringe upon our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings in the United States or in foreign countries could impair our ability to sell our services or license or protect our intellectual property, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have been, are and in the future may be, subject to claims alleging that our technology or business methods infringe intellectual property rights of others, both inside and outside the United States. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could require us to change how we deliver a service, result in significant financial consequences, or both, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense

.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally. From time to time, the United States Congress and foreign, state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rates or impose other obligations. If changes to applicable tax laws are enacted, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.



Our tax returns and positions (including positions regarding jurisdictional authority of foreign governments to impose tax) are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of

December 31, 2014

, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was a liability of

$96.8 million

, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve, and such resolution could have a material effect on our effective tax rate, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the current period and/or future periods. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from the Company's tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows. For example, in 2011, we reached an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003, which resulted in a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter and requires cash payments to the IRS and various state tax authorities of approximately

$190 million

, plus additional accrued interest, of which

$94.1 million

has been paid as of December 31, 2014. See the "Capital Resources and Liquidity" discussion in Part II, Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The IRS completed its examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data, which include our 2005 and pre-Spin-off 2006 taxable periods and issued its report on October 31, 2012 ("FDC 30-Day Letter"). Furthermore, the IRS completed its examination of our United States federal consolidated income tax returns for the 2006 post-Spin-off period through 2009 and issued its report also on October 31, 2012 ("WU 30-Day Letter"). Both the FDC 30-Day Letter and the WU 30-Day Letter propose tax adjustments affecting us, some of which are agreed and some of which are unagreed. We filed our protest on November 28, 2012 related to the unagreed proposed adjustments with the IRS Appeals Division. Discussions with the IRS concerning these adjustments are ongoing. See Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Material changes in the market value or liquidity of the securities we hold may

adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

, we held

$1.5 billion

in investment securities, the substantial majority of which are state and municipal debt securities. The majority of this money represents the principal of money orders issued by us to consumers primarily in the United States and money transfers sent by consumers. We regularly monitor our credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and by diversifying our investments. Despite those measures, it is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions, credit issues, the viability of the issuer of the security, failure by a fund manager to manage the investment portfolio consistently with the fund prospectus or increases in interest rates. Any such decline in value may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The trust holding the assets of our pension plan has assets totaling approximately $302.9 million as of

December 31, 2014

. The fair value of these assets held in the trust are compared to the plan's projected benefit obligation to determine the pension liability of

$74.9 million

recorded within "Other liabilities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2014

. We attempt to mitigate risk through diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk on our portfolio through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and credit issues. Such declines could have an impact on the funded status of our pension plan and future funding requirements.



We have substantial debt obligations that could restrict our operations.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had approximately

$3.7 billion

in consolidated indebtedness, and we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.

Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:

•

limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase stock consistent with our historical practices;

•

increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;

•

limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;

•

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes.

There would be adverse tax consequences associated with using certain earnings generated outside the United States to pay the interest and principal on our indebtedness. Accordingly, this portion of our cash flow will be unavailable under normal circumstances to service our debt obligations.



Risks Related to Our Regulatory and Litigation Environment

As described under Part I, Item 1,

Business

, our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by the United States federal government, each of the states (including licensing requirements), many localities and many other countries and jurisdictions. Laws and regulations to which we are subject include those related to: financial services, consumer disclosure and consumer protection, currency controls, money transfer and payment instrument licensing, payment services, credit and debit cards, electronic payments, foreign exchange hedging services and the sale of spot, forward and option currency contracts, unclaimed property, the regulation of competition, consumer privacy, data protection and information security. The failure by us, our agents or their subagents to comply with any such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could seriously damage our reputation and brands, and result in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs.

Our business is subject to a wide range and increasing number of laws and regulations. Liabilities or loss of business resulting from a failure by us, our agents or their subagents to comply with laws and regulations and regulatory or judicial interpretations thereof, including laws and regulations designed to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other illicit activity, and increased costs or loss of business associated with compliance with those laws and regulations has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse

effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our services are subject to increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little notice. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As United States federal and state as well as foreign legislative and regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect that our costs of complying with these requirements will continue to increase, perhaps substantially, or our compliance will make it more difficult or less desirable for consumers and others to use our services or for us to contract with certain intermediaries, either of which would have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating profit. For example, we made significant additional investments in 2014 in our compliance programs based on the rapidly evolving environment and our internal reviews of the increasingly complex and demanding global regulatory requirements, and we expect additional compliance program costs in 2015 and beyond as well as potential negative business impacts from new compliance procedures. These additional investments relate to enhancing our compliance capabilities, including our consumer protection efforts. Further, failure by Western Union, our agents, or their subagents (agents and subagents are third parties, over whom Western Union has limited legal and practical control) to comply with any of these requirements or their interpretation could result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to provide money transfer, payment or foreign exchange services, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, loss of consumer confidence, the seizure of our assets, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines and restrictions on our ability to offer services.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") in the United States and similar laws in other countries, such as the Bribery Act in the United Kingdom, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some of these laws, such as the Bribery Act, also prohibit improper payments between commercial enterprises. Because our services are offered in virtually every country of the world, we face significant risks associated with our obligations under the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and other national anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated these laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



In addition, our United States business is subject to reporting, recordkeeping and anti-money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the "BSA"), and to regulatory oversight and enforcement by the United States Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"). We have subsidiaries that are subject to banking regulations, namely those in Brazil and Austria. These subsidiaries are also subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the New York Department of Financial Services. Under the Payment Services Directive ("PSD") in the European Union ("EU"), which became effective in late 2009, and similar legislation enacted or proposed in other jurisdictions, we have and will increasingly become directly subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and anti-money laundering regulations, and agent oversight and monitoring requirements, which have increased and will continue to increase our costs. These laws could also increase competition in some or all of our areas of service.

The remittance industry, including Western Union, has come under increasing scrutiny from government regulators and others in connection with its ability to prevent its services from being abused by people seeking to defraud others. While we believe our fraud prevention efforts comply with applicable law, the ingenuity of criminal fraudsters, combined with the potential susceptibility to fraud by consumers, make the prevention of consumer fraud a significant and challenging problem. Our failure to continue to help prevent such frauds and increased costs related to the implementation of enhanced anti-fraud measures, or a change in fraud prevention laws or their interpretation or the manner in which they are enforced could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Further, any determination that our agents or their subagents have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation and brands, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs. In some cases, we could be liable for the failure of our agents or their subagents to comply with laws which also could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The changes associated with the PSD, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and similar legislation enacted or proposed in other countries have resulted and will likely continue to result in increased costs to comply with the new requirements, and in the event we or our agents are unable to comply, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional countries may adopt similar legislation.

For example, in the EU, Western Union is responsible for the compliance of our agents and their subagents with the PSD when they are acting on behalf of one of our payments institution subsidiaries. The majority of our EU activity is managed through our Irish PSD subsidiary, which is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory action against Western Union because of actions by its agents or their subagents and the costs to monitor our agents or their subagents in those areas has increased. The regulations implementing the remittance provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act impose responsibility on us for any related compliance failures of our agents and their subagents.



Our fees, profit margins and/or foreign exchange spreads may be reduced or limited because of regulatory initiatives and changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and industry practices and standards that are either industry wide or specifically targeted at our Company.

The evolving regulatory environment, including increased fees or taxes, regulatory initiatives, and changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, industry practices and standards imposed by state, federal or foreign governments and expectations regarding our compliance efforts, is impacting the manner in which we operate our business, may change the competitive landscape and is expected to continue to adversely affect our financial results. New and proposed legislation relating to financial services providers and consumer protection in various jurisdictions around the world has and may continue to affect the manner in which we provide our services, see risk factor

"

The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by that Act and the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and similar legislation and regulations enacted by other government authorities, could adversely affect us and the scope of our activities, and could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition

.

"

Recently proposed and enacted legislation related to financial services providers and consumer protection in various jurisdictions around the world and at the federal and state level in the United States has subjected and may continue to subject us to additional regulatory oversight, mandate additional consumer disclosures and remedies, including refunds to consumers, or otherwise impact the manner in which we provide our services. If governments implement new laws or regulations that limit our right to set fees and/or foreign exchange spreads, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in regulatory expectations, interpretations or practices could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties.

For example, our business has been affected and is currently being affected by on-going changes to our compliance procedures related to our settlement agreement with the State of Arizona. See risk factor

"

Western Union is the subject of governmental investigations and consent agreements with or enforcement actions by regulators

."

Due to regulatory initiatives, we have changed our compliance related practices and business model along the United States and Mexico border, including in the southwestern region of the United States. Such changes have had, and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, and business operations related to our United States to Mexico and United States to Latin America and the Caribbean corridors.



In addition, one state and one United States territory have passed laws imposing a fee on certain money transfer transactions, and certain other states have proposed similar legislation. Several foreign countries have enacted or proposed rules imposing taxes or fees on certain money transfer transactions, as well. Although money transfer services themselves are not generally subject to sales tax elsewhere in the United States, the current budget shortfalls in many jurisdictions, combined with continued federal inaction on comprehensive immigration reform, may lead other states or localities to impose similar taxes or fees. Similar circumstances in foreign countries have invoked and could continue to invoke the imposition of sales, service or similar taxes on money transfer services. A tax or fee exclusively on money transfer services like Western Union could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other means of remittance which are not subject to the same taxes or fees. Other examples of changes to our financial environment include the possibility of regulatory initiatives that focus on lowering international remittance costs. Such initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Regulators around the world look at each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries, states or regions. Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one service may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another service. As a result, the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated, affecting our business in another place or involving another service. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our services, fees and other important aspects of our business, with the same effect. Either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Regulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards affecting us, our agents or their subagents, or the banks with which we or our agents maintain bank accounts needed to provide our services could require changes in our business model and increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity

.

Our agents and their subagents are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements, which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to change. Material changes in the regulatory requirements for offering money transfer services, including with respect to anti-money laundering requirements, fraud prevention, consumer protection, customer due diligence, agent registration, or increased requirements to monitor our agents or their subagents in a jurisdiction important to our business have meant and could continue to mean increased costs and/or operational demands on our agents and their subagents, which have resulted and could continue to result in their attrition, a decrease in the number of locations at which money transfer services are offered, an increase in the commissions paid to agents and their subagents to compensate for their increased costs, and other negative consequences.

Our regulatory status and the regulatory status of our agents could affect our and their ability to offer our services. For example, we and our agents rely on bank accounts to provide our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer services. We also rely on bank accounts to provide our payment services. We and our agents are considered Money Service Businesses, or "MSBs," under the BSA, including our Business Solutions operations. An increasing number of banks view MSBs, as a class, as higher risk customers for purposes of their anti-money laundering programs. Furthermore, we and some of our agents have had difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships due to the banks' policies. If we or a significant number of our agents are unable to maintain existing or establish new banking relationships, or if we or these agents face higher fees to maintain or establish new bank accounts, our ability and the ability of our agents to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The types of enterprises that are legally authorized to act as our agents vary significantly from one country to another. Changes in the laws affecting the kinds of entities that are permitted to act as money transfer agents (such as changes in requirements for capitalization or ownership) could adversely affect our ability to distribute our services and the cost of providing such services, both by us and our agents. For example, a requirement that a money transfer provider be a bank or other highly regulated financial entity could increase significantly the cost of providing our services in many countries where that requirement does not exist today or could prevent us from offering our services in an affected country. Further, any changes in law that would require us to provide money transfer services directly to consumers as opposed to through an agent network (which would effectively change our business model) or that would prohibit or impede the use of subagents could significantly adversely impact our ability to provide our services, and/or the cost of our services, in the relevant jurisdiction. Changes mandated by laws which make Western Union responsible for acts of its agents while they are providing the Western Union money transfer service increase our risk of regulatory liability and our costs to monitor our agents' performance.



Although most of our Orlandi Valuta and Vigo branded agents also offer money transfer services of our competitors, many of our Western Union branded agents have agreed to offer only our money transfer services. While we expect to continue signing certain agents under exclusive arrangements and believe that these agreements are valid and enforceable, changes in laws regulating competition or in the interpretation of those laws could undermine our ability to enforce them in the future. Over the past several years, several countries in Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and South Asia, including India, have promulgated laws or regulations, or authorities in these countries have issued orders, which effectively prohibit payment service providers, such as money transfer companies, from agreeing to exclusive arrangements with agents in those countries. Certain institutions, non-governmental organizations and others are actively advocating against exclusive arrangements in money transfer agent agreements. Advocates for laws prohibiting or limiting exclusive agreements continue to push for enactment of similar laws in other jurisdictions. In addition to legal challenges, certain of our agents and their subagents have refused to enter into exclusive arrangements. See risk factor

"

If we are unable to maintain our agent, subagent or global business relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place, including due to increased costs or loss of business as a result of increased compliance requirements or difficulty for us, our agents or their subagents in establishing or maintaining relationships with banks needed to conduct our services, or if our agents or their subagents fail to comply with Western Union business and technology standards and contract requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected

"

above. The inability to enter into exclusive arrangements or to maintain our exclusive rights in agent contracts in certain situations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations by, for example, allowing competitors to benefit from the goodwill associated with the Western Union brand at our agent locations.

In addition to legal or regulatory restrictions discussed in the "Capital Resources and Liquidity" section in Part II, Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, some jurisdictions use tangible net worth and other financial strength guidelines to evaluate financial position. If our regulated subsidiaries do not abide by these guidelines, they may be subject to heightened review by these jurisdictions, and the jurisdictions may be more likely to impose new formal financial strength requirements. Additional financial strength requirements imposed on our regulated subsidiaries or significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transfer providers could impact our primary source of liquidity.

Western Union is the subject of governmental investigations and consent agreements with or enforcement actions by regulators

.

State of Arizona Settlement Agreement

On February 11, 2010, Western Union Financial Services, Inc. ("WUFSI"), a subsidiary of the Company, signed a settlement agreement ("Southwest Border Agreement"), which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona (the "State") and required the Company to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. As part of the Southwest Border Agreement, the Company has made and expects to make certain investments in its compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor (the "Monitor") has been engaged for those programs. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the Southwest Border Agreement. The Monitor has made a number of recommendations related to the Company's compliance programs, which we are implementing, including programs related to our Business Solutions segment.

On January 31, 2014, the Southwest Border Agreement was amended to extend its term until December 31, 2017 (the "Amendment"). The Amendment imposes additional obligations on the Company and WUFSI in connection with WUFSI’s anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance programs and cooperation with law enforcement. In particular, the Amendment requires WUFSI to continue implementing the primary and secondary recommendations made by the Monitor appointed pursuant to the Southwest Border Agreement related to WUFSI’s AML compliance program, and includes, among other things, timeframes for implementing such primary and secondary recommendations. Under the Amendment, the Monitor could make additional primary recommendations until January 1, 2015 and may make additional secondary recommendations until January 31, 2017. After these dates, the Monitor may only make additional primary or secondary recommendations, as applicable, that meet certain requirements as set forth in the Amendment. The Monitor has made more than


primary recommendations and groups of primary recommendations. Primary recommendations may also be re-classified as secondary recommendations.



The changes in WUFSI’s AML program required by the Southwest Border Agreement, including the Amendment, and the Monitor’s recommendations have had, and will continue to have, adverse effects on the Company’s business, including additional costs. Additionally, and as described in detail in Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,

Note 5

,

"Commitments and Contingencies," if WUFSI is not able to implement a successful AML compliance program along the U.S. and Mexico border or timely implement the Monitor’s recommendations, each as determined by the Monitor, the State may pursue remedies under the Southwest Border Agreement and Amendment, including assessment of fines and civil and criminal actions.  Such fines and actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Other Matters

As further described under Part I, Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, the Company is the subject of ongoing investigations, including by (1) various United States Attorneys' offices; (2) various state attorneys general; (3) the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"); (4) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"); and (5) the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Due to the preliminary nature of these continuing investigations, the Company is unable to predict their outcome, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Additionally, as it has done in recent years, the Company may enter into consent agreements with governmental authorities (federal, state, local, and foreign) relating to these or other regulatory matters that could require us to make various payments and to take certain measures to enhance our compliance with applicable legal requirements. Should governmental authorities determine to bring criminal charges or civil claims, or if the Company enters into additional consent decrees with governmental authorities, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, the Company regularly receives subpoenas and other requests for documents and information from governmental authorities concerning our business, current or former agents, customers or other third parties. We cooperate with such subpoenas and requests in the ordinary course of our business. However, it is possible that, during the course of any investigation or review by such governmental authorities, allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing could arise regarding Western Union, its employees, current or former agents, customers or other third parties, which could lead to investigations or enforcement actions against us.

The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by that Act and the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and similar legislation and regulations enacted by other government authorities, could adversely affect us and the scope of our activities, and could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition

.

The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in the United States on July 21, 2010, calls for significant structural reforms and new substantive regulation across the financial services industry. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, whose purpose is to implement, examine for compliance with and enforce federal consumer protection laws governing financial products and services, including money transfer services. The CFPB has created additional regulatory obligations for us and has the authority to examine and supervise us and our larger competitors. The CFPB's regulations implementing the remittance provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have affected our business in a variety of areas. These include: a requirement to provide almost all consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced, written, pre-transaction disclosures, including the disclosure of fees, foreign exchange rates and taxes, an obligation to resolve various errors, including certain errors that may be outside our control, and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a consumer's request. In addition, these regulations impose responsibility on us for any related compliance failures of our agents. These requirements have changed the way we operate our business and along with other potential changes under CFPB regulations could adversely affect our operations and financial results and change the way we operate our business. The Dodd-Frank Act and interpretations and actions by the CFPB could also have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to limit or change our business practices, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, requiring us to invest valuable management time and resources in compliance efforts, imposing additional costs on us, delaying our ability to respond to marketplace changes, requiring us to alter our products and services in a manner that would make our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability to offer them profitably, or requiring us to make other changes that could adversely affect our business.



The CFPB has broad authority to enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has a large staff and budget, which is not subject to Congressional appropriation, and has broad authority with respect to our money transfer service and related business. It is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track and solicit consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. The CFPB's authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or to rescind or ignore past regulatory guidance, could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Our litigation exposure may also be increased by the CFPB's authority to limit or ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses. In December 2013, the CFPB released the preliminary results of its arbitration study, which is widely viewed as the first step in an effort to restrict the use of such clauses in consumer financial contracts.

We will be subject to examination by the CFPB, which in September 2014 finalized a rule defining "larger participants of a market for other consumer financial products or services" as including companies, such as Western Union, that make at least one million aggregate annual international money transfers. The CFPB has the authority to examine and supervise us and our larger competitors, which will involve providing reports to the CFPB. Based on examination material that has been published by the CFPB, we expect the CFPB to conduct rigorous examinations, which could result in further changes to our operating procedures. The CFPB has used information gained in examinations as the basis for enforcement actions resulting in settlements involving monetary penalties and other remedies.

The effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB on our business and operations has been and will continue to be significant and the application of the Dodd-Frank Act's implementing regulations to our business may differ from the application to certain of our competitors, including banks. Some of the Dodd-Frank Act's implementing regulations have not been issued and the function and scope of the CFPB, the reactions of our competitors and the responses of consumers and other marketplace participants are uncertain. Further, and in addition to our own compliance costs, implementation of requirements under Dodd-Frank could impact our business relationships with financial institution customers who outsource processing of consumer transactions to our Business Solutions segment. These financial institutions may determine that the compliance costs associated with providing consumer services are too burdensome and consequently may limit or discontinue offering such services.

Rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as the provisions of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and its technical standards, which are directly applicable in the member states of the European Union, have subjected most of our foreign exchange hedging transactions, including certain intercompany hedging transactions, certain of the corporate interest rate hedging transactions we may enter into in the future, and certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer as part of our Business Solutions segment, to reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements. Additionally, certain of the corporate interest rate hedging transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing and margin requirements and certain of our other transactions may become so in the future. Our implementation of these requirements has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional costs to our business. Furthermore, our failure to implement these requirements correctly could result in fines and other sanctions, as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities. Any such fines, sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Additionally, the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the United States and European Union are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes, our designation under such regimes, or the implementation of new rules under such regimes may result in additional costs to our business. Other jurisdictions outside of the United States and the European Union are considering, have implemented, or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these will result in greater costs to us as well.



Western Union is the subject of litigation, including purported class action litigation, which could result in material settlements, fines or penalties.

As a company that provides global financial services primarily to consumers, we are subject to litigation, including purported class action litigation, and regulatory actions alleging violations of consumer protection, anti-money laundering, securities laws and other laws. We also are subject to claims asserted by consumers based on individual transactions. We may not be successful in defending ourselves in these matters, and such failure may result in substantial fines, damages and expenses, revocation of required licenses or other limitations on our ability to conduct business. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we believe increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements and increased regulatory investigations and enforcement are likely to continue to result in changes to our business, as well as increased costs, supervision and examination for both ourselves and our agents and subagents. These developments in turn may result in additional litigation or other actions. For more information please see Part I, Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

and Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, Note 5, "Commitments and Contingencies."

Current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition

.

We are subject to requirements relating to privacy and data use and security under federal, state and foreign laws. For example, the FTC has an on-going program of investigating the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many, resulting in multi-million dollar settlements and multi-year agreements governing the settling companies' privacy practices. Furthermore, certain industry groups require us to adhere to privacy requirements in addition to federal, state and foreign laws, and certain of our business relationships depend upon our compliance with these requirements. As the number of countries enacting privacy and related laws increases and the scope of these laws and enforcement efforts expand, we will increasingly become subject to new and varying requirements. Failure to comply with existing or future privacy and data use and security laws, regulations, and requirements to which we are subject or could become subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, overall business and reputation.

In addition, in connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, Western Union makes information available to certain United States federal, state, and foreign government agencies when required by law. In recent years, Western Union has experienced increasing data sharing requests by these agencies, particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or reduce the risk of identity theft. During the same period, there has also been increased public attention to the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals - the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the individual's right to privacy - may conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled. The legal, political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose Western Union to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage.

We are subject to unclaimed property laws, and differences between the amounts we have accrued for unclaimed property and amounts that are claimed by a state or foreign jurisdiction could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to unclaimed property laws in the United States and abroad which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers. We have an ongoing program to help us comply with those laws. In addition, we are subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices. Any difference between the amounts we have accrued for unclaimed property and amounts that are claimed by a state or foreign jurisdiction could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows. See "Unclaimed Property Regulations" for further discussion.



Our consolidated balance sheet may not contain sufficient amounts or types of

regulatory capital to meet the changing requirements of our various regulators

worldwide, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results

of operations.

Our regulators expect us to possess sufficient financial soundness and strength to adequately support our regulated subsidiaries. We had substantial indebtedness as of

December 31, 2014

, which could make it more difficult to meet these requirements if such requirements are increased. In addition, although we are not a bank holding company for purposes of United States law or the law of any other jurisdiction, as a global provider of payments services and in light of the changing regulatory environment in various jurisdictions, we could become subject to new capital requirements introduced or imposed by our regulators that could require us to issue securities that would qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital under the Basel Committee accords or retain earnings over a period of time. Also, our regulators specify the amount and composition of settlement assets that certain of our subsidiaries must hold in order to satisfy our outstanding settlement obligations. These regulators could further restrict the type of instruments that qualify as settlement assets or these regulators could require our regulated subsidiaries to maintain higher levels of settlement assets. For example, we have seen increased scrutiny from government regulators regarding the sufficiency of our capitalization and the appropriateness of our investments held in order to comply with state and other licensing requirements. Any change or increase in these regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Risks Relating to the Spin-Off

We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed 100% of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (the "Spin-off") through this previously owned subsidiary. The consolidated United States federal income tax return for First Data for 2006, which included the Company, has been examined by the IRS and no adjustments were proposed relating to the tax treatment of the Spin-Off. However, certain other adjustments were proposed by the IRS and are being contested through the IRS appeals process. Accordingly, the statute of limitations covering First Data’s 2006 return has not yet closed.

If the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, First Data and its

stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and, in certain circumstances,

we could be required to indemnify First Data for material taxes

pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax allocation agreement.

First Data received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the Spin-off (including certain related transactions) qualifies as a tax-free transaction to First Data, us and First Data stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes under sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, assuming, among other things, the accuracy of the representations made by First Data to the IRS in the private letter ruling request. If the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request were determined to be untrue or incomplete, then First Data and we would not be able to rely on the ruling.

The Spin-off was conditioned upon First Data's receipt of an opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, counsel to First Data, to the effect that, with respect to requirements on which the IRS did not rule, those requirements would be satisfied. The opinion was based on, among other things, certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by First Data and us which, if untrue or incomplete, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion.

If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and an opinion of tax counsel, the Spin-off were determined to be a taxable transaction, each holder of First Data common stock who received shares of our common stock in connection with the Spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair value of our common stock received. First Data would recognize taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by First Data in the contribution over First Data's tax basis in the assets contributed to us in the contribution. If First Data were unable to pay any taxes for which it is responsible under the tax allocation agreement, the IRS might seek to collect such taxes from Western Union.

Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualified as a tax-free distribution under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Spin-off may result in significant United States federal income tax liabilities to First Data if 50% or more of First Data's stock or our stock (in each case, by vote or value) is treated as having been acquired, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Spin-off. For purposes of this test, any acquisitions, or any understanding, arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition, within two years before or after the Spin-off are subject to special scrutiny.

With respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant tax opinion) ("Spin-off Related Taxes"), we, one of our affiliates or any person that, after the Spin-off, is an affiliate thereof, will be liable to First Data for any such Spin-off Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by or with respect to us. In addition, we will also be liable for 50% of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that would not have been imposed but for the existence of both an action by us and an action by First Data or (ii) where we and First Data each take actions that, standing alone, would have resulted in the imposition of such Spin-off Related Taxes. We may be similarly liable if we breach certain representations or covenants set forth in the tax allocation agreement. If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

United States Department of Justice Investigations

On March 20, 2012, the Company was served with a federal grand jury subpoena issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California ("USAO-CDCA") seeking documents relating to Shen Zhou International ("US Shen Zhou"), a former Western Union agent located in Monterey Park, California. The principal of US Shen Zhou was indicted in 2010 and in December 2013, pled guilty to one count of structuring international money transfers in violation of United States federal law in U.S. v. Zhi He Wang (SA CR 10-196, C.D. Cal.). Concurrent with the government's service of the subpoena, the government notified the Company that it is a target of an ongoing investigation into structuring and money laundering. Since March 20, 2012, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the USAO-CDCA seeking additional documents relating to US Shen Zhou, materials relating to certain other former and current agents and other materials relating to the Company's anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance policies and procedures. The government has interviewed several current and former Western Union employees and has served grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from several current and former employees. The government's investigation is ongoing and the Company may receive additional requests for information as part of the investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the government. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the government's investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Should such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

In March 2012, the Company was served with a federal grand jury subpoena issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (“USAO-EDPA”) seeking documents relating to Hong Fai General Contractor Corp. (formerly known as Yong General Construction) (“Hong Fai”), a former Western Union agent located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since March 2012, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the USAO-EDPA seeking additional documents relating to Hong Fai. The government has interviewed several current Western Union employees. The government's investigation is ongoing and the Company may receive additional requests for information as part of the investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the government. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the government's investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Should such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.



On November 25, 2013, the Company was served with a federal grand jury subpoena issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (“USAO-MDPA”) seeking documents relating to complaints made to the Company by consumers anywhere in the world relating to fraud-induced money transfers since January 1, 2008. Concurrent with the government's service of the subpoena, the government notified the Company that it is the subject of the investigation. Since November 25, 2013, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the USAO-MDPA seeking documents relating to certain Western Union agents and Western Union’s agent suspension and termination policies. The government's investigation is ongoing and the Company may receive additional requests for information as part of the investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the government. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the government's investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Should such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

On March 6, 2014, the Company was served with a federal grand jury subpoena issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) seeking a variety of AML compliance materials, including documents relating to the Company’s AML, Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) and Currency Transaction Report procedures, transaction monitoring protocols, BSA and AML training programs and publications, AML compliance investigation reports, compliance-related agent termination files, SARs, BSA audits, BSA and AML-related management reports and AML compliance staffing levels. The subpoena also calls for Board meeting minutes and organization charts. The period covered by the subpoena is January 1, 2007 to November 27, 2013. The Company has received additional subpoenas from the USAO-SDFL and the Broward County, Florida Sheriff’s Office relating to the investigation, including a federal grand jury subpoena issued by the USAO-SDFL on March 14, 2014, seeking information about 33 agent locations in Costa Rica such as ownership and operating agreements, SARs and AML compliance and BSA filings for the period January 1, 2008 to November 27, 2013. Subsequently, the USAO-SDFL served the Company with seizure warrants requiring the Company to seize all money transfers sent from the United States to two agent locations located in Costa Rica for a 10-day period beginning in late March 2014. On July 8, 2014, the government served a grand jury subpoena calling for records relating to transactions sent from the United States to Nicaragua and Panama between September 1, 2013 and October 31, 2013. The government has also notified the Company that it is a target of the investigation. The investigation is ongoing and the Company may receive additional requests for information or seizure warrants as part of the investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the government. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the government's investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Should such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

Other Governmental Investigations

Since 2011, Western Union has received civil investigative demands from certain state attorneys general who have initiated an investigation into the adequacy of the Company's consumer protection efforts over the last several years. The civil investigative demands seek information and documents relating to money transfers sent from the United States to certain countries, consumer fraud complaints that the Company has received and the Company's procedures to help identify and prevent fraudulent transfers. Due to the stage of the investigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with any possible civil claims that might be brought by one or more of the states. Should such claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards, or regulatory consequences, or compulsory changes in our business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



The Company has had discussions with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") regarding the Company's consumer protection and anti-fraud programs. On December 12, 2012, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the FTC requesting that the Company produce (i) all documents relating to communications with the monitor appointed pursuant to the agreement and settlement (the "Southwest Border Agreement") Western Union Financial Services, Inc. entered into with the State of Arizona on February 11, 2010, as amended, including information the Company provided to the monitor and any reports prepared by the monitor; and (ii) all documents relating to complaints made to the Company by consumers anywhere in the world relating to fraud-induced money transfers since January 1, 2011. On April 15, 2013, the FTC filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York requesting an order to compel production of the requested documents. On June 6, 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the FTC's request. On August 14, 2013, the FTC filed a notice of appeal. On August 27, 2013, Western Union filed a notice of cross-appeal. On February 21, 2014, the Company received another civil investigative demand from the FTC requesting the production of all documents relating to complaints made to the Company by or on behalf of consumers relating to fraud-induced money transfers that were sent from or received in the United States since January 1, 2004, except for documents that were already produced to the FTC in response to the first civil investigative demand. On October 7, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered a summary order reversing in part and vacating and remanding in part the June 6, 2013 order entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 22, 2014, the Company received another civil investigative demand issued by the FTC requesting documents and information since January 1, 2004 relating to the Company’s consumer fraud program, its policies and procedures governing agent termination, suspension, probation and reactivation, its efforts to comply with its 2005 agreement with 47 states and the District of Columbia regarding consumer fraud prevention, and complaints made to the Company by or on behalf of consumers concerning fraud-induced money transfers that were sent to or from the United States, excluding complaint-related documents that were produced to the FTC in response to the earlier civil investigative demands. The civil investigative demand also seeks various documents concerning approximately 720 agents, including documents relating to the transactions they sent and paid and the Company’s investigations of and communications with them. The Company may receive additional civil investigative demands from the FTC. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter, or provide a range of loss, if any, which could be associated with any possible claims that might be brought against the Company.

In August 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) served Paymap, Inc. (“Paymap”), a subsidiary of the Company which operates solely in the United States, with a civil investigative demand requesting information and documents about Paymap’s Equity Accelerator service, which is designed to help consumers pay off their mortgages more quickly. The CFPB’s investigation sought to determine whether Paymap’s marketing of the Equity Accelerator service violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (“UDAAP”). The Company cooperated with the investigation. After reviewing information and documents provided by the Company, in August 2014, the CFPB advised the Company of its view that certain aspects of Paymap’s marketing violated UDAAP. The Company has advised the CFPB that it disagrees with the CFPB’s position. The Company is in discussions with the CFPB and is seeking to reach an appropriate resolution of this matter. Due to the early stage of the discussions, the Company is unable to predict whether the CFPB will institute an enforcement action to bring any claims against the Company as a result of the investigation, or the possible range of loss, if any, which could be associated with such an action. Should the CFPB institute an enforcement action against the Company, the Company could face significant restitution payments to certain Equity Accelerator consumers, civil money penalties, or regulatory consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In December 2013, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) advised the Company that it was conducting an investigation relating to (i) the Company’s digital and electronic channels and the revenues allocated to and reported by those channels; and (ii) the Payment Services Directive and the Company’s strategic initiatives surrounding the Payment Services Directive. Subsequently, the SEC served the Company with subpoenas seeking information relating to its investigation. On September 3, 2014, in connection with its investigation relating to the Company’s digital and electronic channels, the SEC filed an application in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado seeking an order compelling the production of certain email and other electronically stored information for three employees. After the Company and the SEC reached an agreement on the production of that material, the SEC withdrew its application. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter, or the range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of this investigation.



Shareholder Actions

On December 10, 2013, City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System filed a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against The Western Union Company, its President and Chief Executive Officer and a former executive officer of the Company, asserting claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Securities and Exchange Commission rule 10b-5 against all defendants. On September 26, 2014, the Court appointed SEB Asset Management S.A. and SEB Investment Management AB as lead plaintiffs. On October 27, 2014, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint, which asserts the same claims as the original complaint, except that it brings the claims under section 20(a) of the Exchange Act only against the individual defendants. The consolidated amended complaint also adds as a defendant another former executive officer of the Company. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that, during the purported class period, February 7, 2012 through October 30, 2012, defendants made false or misleading statements or failed to disclose adverse material facts known to them, including those regarding: (1) the competitive advantage the Company derived from its compliance program; (2) the Company’s ability to increase market share, make limited price adjustments and withstand competitive pressures; (3) the effect of compliance measures under the Southwest Border Agreement on agent retention and business in Mexico; and (4) the Company’s progress in implementing an anti-money laundering program for the Southwest Border Area. On December 11, 2014, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On January 5, 2015, plaintiffs filed an opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On January 23, 2015, defendants filed a reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. This action is in a preliminary stage and the Company is unable to predict the outcome, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with this action. The Company and the named individuals intend to vigorously defend themselves in this matter.

On January 13, 2014, Natalie Gordon served the Company with a Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint and Jury Demand that was filed in District Court, Douglas County, Colorado naming the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, one of its former executive officers, one of its former directors, and all but one of its current directors as individual defendants, and the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and gross mismanagement against all of the individual defendants and unjust enrichment against the President and Chief Executive Officer and the former executive officer based on allegations that between February 12, 2012 to October 30, 2012, the individual defendants made or caused the Company to issue false and misleading statements or failed to make adequate disclosures regarding the effects of the Southwest Border Agreement, including regarding the anticipated costs of compliance with the Southwest Border Agreement, potential effects on business operations, and Company projections. Plaintiff also alleges that the individual defendants caused or allowed the Company to lack requisite internal controls, caused or allowed financial statements to be misstated, and caused the Company to be subject to the costs, expenses and liabilities associated with the City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System lawsuit. Plaintiff further alleges that the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and the former executive officer received excessive compensation based on the allegedly inaccurate financial statements. On March 12, 2014, the Court entered an order granting the parties' joint motion to stay proceedings in the case during the pendency of certain of the shareholder derivative actions described below.



In 2014, Stanley Lieblein, R. Andre Klein, City of Cambridge Retirement System, Mayar Fund Ltd, Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, and MARTA/ATU Local 732 Employees Retirement Plan filed shareholder derivative complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado naming the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and certain current and former directors and a former executive officer as individual defendants and the Company as a nominal defendant.  On January 5, 2015, the court entered an order consolidating the actions and appointing City of Cambridge Retirement System and MARTA/ATU Local 732 Employees Retirement Plan as co-lead plaintiffs.  On February 4, 2015, co-lead plaintiffs filed a verified consolidated shareholder derivative complaint naming the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, two of its former executive officers and all but two of its current directors as individual defendants, and the Company as a nominal defendant.  The consolidated complaint asserts separate claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the director defendants and the officer defendants, claims against all of the individual defendants for violations of section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, corporate waste and unjust enrichment, and a claim against the former executive officer for breach of fiduciary duties for insider selling and misappropriation of information. The breach of fiduciary duty claim against the director defendants includes allegations that they declined to implement an effective anti-money laundering compliance system after receiving numerous red flags indicating prolonged willful illegality, obstructed the Southwest Border Monitor's efforts to impose effective compliance systems on the Company, failed to take action in response to alleged Western Union management efforts to undermine the Monitor, reappointed the same directors to the Audit Committee and Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committees constituting a majority of those committees between 2006 and 2014, appointed a majority of directors to the Compliance Committee who were directly involved in overseeing the alleged misconduct as members of the Audit Committee and the Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee, caused the Company to materially breach the Southwest Border Agreement, caused the Company to repurchase its stock at artificially inflated prices, awarded the Company’s senior executives excessive compensation despite their responsibility for the Company’s alleged willful non-compliance with state and federal anti-money laundering laws, and failed to prevent the former executive officer from misappropriating and profiting from nonpublic information when making allegedly unlawful stock sales. The breach of fiduciary duty claim against the officer defendants includes allegations that they caused the Company and allowed its agents to ignore the recording and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and parallel anti-money laundering laws and regulations for a prolonged period of time, authorized and implemented anti-money laundering policies and practices that they knew or should have known to be inadequate, caused the Company to fail to comply with the Southwest Border Agreement and refused to implement and maintain adequate internal controls. The claim for violations of section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act includes allegations that the individual defendants caused the Company to issue proxy statements in 2012, 2013 and 2014 containing materially incomplete and inaccurate disclosures - in particular, by failing to disclose the extent to which the Company’s financial results depended on the non-compliance with AML requirements, the Board’s awareness of the regulatory and criminal enforcement actions in real time pursuant to the 2003 Consent Agreement with the California Department of Financial Institutions and that the directors were not curing violations and preventing misconduct, the extent to which the Board considered the flood of increasingly severe red flags in their determination to re-nominate certain directors to the Audit Committee between 2006 and 2010, and the extent to which the Board considered ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations in awarding multi-million dollar compensation packages to senior executives. The corporate waste claim includes allegations that the individual defendants paid or approved the payment of undeserved executive and director compensation based on the illegal conduct alleged in the consolidated complaint, which exposed the Company to civil liabilities and fines. The corporate waste claim also includes allegations that the individual defendants made improper statements and omissions, which forced the Company to expend resources in defending itself in the

City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System

action described above, authorized the repurchase of over $1.565 billion of the Company’s stock at prices they knew or recklessly were aware, were artificially inflated, failed to maintain sufficient internal controls over the Company’s marketing and sales process, failed to consider the interests of the Company and its shareholders, and failed to conduct the proper supervision. The claim for unjust enrichment includes allegations that the individual defendants derived compensation, fees and other benefits from the Company and were otherwise unjustly enriched by their wrongful acts and omissions in managing the Company. The claim for breach of fiduciary duties for insider selling and misappropriation of information includes allegations that the former executive sold Company stock while knowing material, nonpublic information that would have significantly reduced the market price of the stock.



On December 10, 2014, The Police Retirement System of St. Louis filed a Verified Shareholder Derivative Complaint in District Court, Denver County, Colorado, naming the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, one of its former executive officers, three of its former directors and all but two of its current directors as individual defendants, and the Company as a nominal defendant.  The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment, based on allegations that the individual defendants (1) caused the Company to fail to comply with its obligations under the Southwest Border Agreement; (2) misrepresented the costs and impact of the Southwest Border Agreement; (3) caused the Company to repurchase its stock at artificially inflated prices; (4) failed to implement and maintain adequate internal controls; (5) knowingly or recklessly reviewed and approved improper statements in the Company’s public filings, press releases and conference calls; (6) failed to ensure the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (7) facilitated the use of the Company’s operations for money-laundering and other various crimes, including human trafficking; (8) forced the Company to expend valuable resources in defending itself in the

City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System

action described above; and (9) paid improper compensation and bonuses to certain of the Company’s executives and directors who allegedly breached their fiduciary duties.  The complaint also alleges that the individual defendants were unjustly enriched as a result of the compensation and director remuneration they received while breaching their fiduciary duties and that the former executive officer sold Company stock while in possession of material, adverse, non-public information that artificially inflated the price of Western Union stock. On December 17, 2014, one of the individual defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. On January 16, 2015, plaintiff filed a motion to remand the case to state court. On February 9, 2015, the individual defendant who removed the case filed an opposition to the motion to remand. The Company filed a motion to consolidate this action with the

Lieblein

action described above, which the plaintiff has opposed.

All of the actions described above under "Shareholder Actions" are in a preliminary stage and the Company is unable to predict the outcome, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with these actions. The Company and the named individuals intend to vigorously defend themselves in all of these matters.

Other Matters

On March 12, 2014, Jason Douglas filed a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting a claim under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq., based on allegations that since 2009, the Company has sent text messages to class members’ wireless telephones without their consent. The plaintiff has not sought and the Court has not granted class certification. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter. However, due to the preliminary stage of the lawsuit and the uncertainty as to whether it will ever be certified as a class action, the potential outcome cannot be determined.

In addition, the Company is a party to a variety of other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business. While the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

Overview

We are a leading provider of money movement and payment services, operating in three business segments:

•

Consumer-to-Consumer

- The Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment facilitates money transfers between two consumers, primarily through a network of third-party agents. Our multi-currency, real-time money transfer service is viewed by us as one interconnected global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the world. Our money transfer services are available for international cross-border transfers - that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another - and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers - that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. This segment also includes money transfer transactions that can be initiated through websites, mobile devices, and account based money transfers.

•

Consumer-to-Business

- The Consumer-to-Business operating segment facilitates bill payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. The

significant majority

of the segment's revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented, with the remainder primarily generated in Argentina.

•

Business Solutions

- The Business Solutions operating segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The

majority

of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at the spot rate, which enables customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments.

All businesses that have not been classified in the above segments are reported as "Other" and include our money order and other businesses and services, in addition to costs for the review and closing of acquisitions.



Our key strategic priorities are focused on:

•

Strengthening consumer money transfer

- We continue to implement key actions in our consumer money transfer business, including: expanding online money transfers, including through mobile devices; optimizing the performance and expansion of our distribution network; strengthening our customer relationships; improving our information technology systems; and enhancing our compliance capabilities. We also plan to continue connecting the cash and digital worlds for our consumers. Electronic channels delivered strong growth in 2014 and generated new customer acquisitions. We plan to accelerate usage in 2015 through added capabilities, enhanced value propositions and expanded reach. Money transfer services through electronic channels, which include online, account based, and mobile money transfer, combined were approximately 6% of consolidated revenue for the year ended

December 31, 2014

.

•

Expanding the reach and penetration of Western Union Business Solutions

- In Western Union Business Solutions, we are working to drive new customer acquisition and growth opportunities with existing customers through increased sales effectiveness and tailored product solutions for specific market segments. Business Solutions represented 7% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Revenues overview

Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction fees are fees that consumers pay when they send money or make payments. Consumer-to-Consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent and received. Additionally, in certain consumer money transfer and Business Solutions transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate foreign exchange revenues based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire the currency. In our Consumer-to-Consumer business, foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by international Consumer-to-Consumer cross-currency transactions. The significant majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues were contributed by our Consumer-to-Consumer segment for all periods presented, which is discussed in greater detail in "Segment Discussion."

2014 compared to 2013

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

compared to 2013, consolidated revenues increased

1%

primarily due to

5%

transaction growth in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, negatively impacted consolidated revenue growth by approximately

3%

in the year ended December 31, 2014.

Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased amounts of cross-border principal sent in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, increases in our retail walk-in foreign exchange services due to our acquisition of the Brazilian foreign exchange operations of Fitta DTVM S.A and Fitta Turismo Ltd ("Fitta") in the first quarter of 2014, and growth in our Business Solutions segment.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, have resulted in a reduction to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 of

$157.5 million

over the previous year.

2013 compared to 2012

Consolidated revenue decreased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. This decrease was caused by our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, primarily due to price reductions in key corridors and the impact of compliance related actions in various corridors, partially offset by Consumer-to-Consumer transaction growth. The strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1% in the year ended December 31, 2013.

Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to growth in our Business Solutions segment and increased amounts of cross-border principal sent in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, partially offset by price reductions in certain corridors in our Consumer-to-Consumer segment.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies have resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $70.3 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates.



Operating expenses overview

Enhanced Regulatory Compliance

The financial services industry, including money services businesses, continues to be subject to increasingly strict legal and

regulatory requirements, and we regularly review our compliance programs. In connection with these reviews, and in light of growing and rapidly evolving regulatory complexity and heightened attention of, and increased dialogue with, governmental and regulatory authorities related to our compliance activities, we have made, and continue to make enhancements to our processes and systems designed to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud and other illicit activity, along with enhancements to improve consumer protection related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and similar regulations outside the United States, and other matters. In coming periods we expect these enhancements will continue to result in changes to certain of our business practices and increased costs. Some of these changes have had, and we believe will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

TGBP integration expenses

During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we incurred

$19.3 million

and

$42.8 million

, respectively, of integration expenses related to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments ("TGBP"). TGBP integration expense consists primarily of severance and other benefits, retention, direct and incremental expense consisting of facility relocation, consolidation and closures; IT systems integration; amortization of a transitional trademark license; and other expenses such as training, travel and professional fees. Integration expense does not include costs related to the completion of the TGBP acquisition.

Cost of services

Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represented approximately two-thirds of total cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2014 and generally fluctuate with revenues.

Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to variable costs that generally fluctuate with revenues and transactions, such as agent commissions and bank-related fees. Additionally, cost of services increased due to higher bank-related fees in our Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions segments and higher agent commission rates in the walk-in services of our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, primarily from the renewal of certain strategic agent agreements. These increases were partially offset by benefits from our productivity and cost-savings initiatives. For further discussion of our productivity and cost-savings initiatives, see Note 3 to Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statement and Supplementary Data

. Additionally, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies resulted in a positive impact on the translation of our expenses.

Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year due to investments in our strategic initiatives, primarily in information technology, increased variable costs that increase as transactions increase, costs associated with our productivity and cost-savings initiatives, and increased compliance program costs, partially offset by reduced agent commissions, which decrease as revenue decreases, the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a positive impact on the translation of our expenses, and savings from our productivity and cost-savings initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to benefits from our productivity and cost-savings initiatives and decreased integration costs related to the acquisition of TGBP, partially offset by increased compliance program (see "Enhanced Regulatory Compliance" described above) and legal costs. Additionally, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies resulted in a positive impact on the translation of our expenses.



Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year due to increased compliance program costs, including costs related to our amended settlement agreement with the State of Arizona, investments in our strategic initiatives, lower compensation expenses in 2012, and costs associated with our productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by decreased TGBP integration costs, savings from our productivity and cost-savings initiatives, decreased marketing expenses, and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a positive impact on the translation of our expenses.

Total other expense, net

Total other expense, net was materially consistent for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.

Total other expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year due to increased interest expense related to higher average debt balances outstanding. Additionally, total other expense, net increased due to other gains recognized in 2012 that did not occur in 2013.

Income taxes

Our effective tax rates on pre-tax income were

12.0%

,

13.9%

and

12.2%

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the combined effect of various discrete items, including those related to foreign currency fluctuations on certain income tax attributes, and changes in tax contingency reserves, partially offset by changes in the composition of earnings between foreign and domestic. The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to the combined effect of various discrete items, partially offset by an increasing proportion of profits that were foreign-derived in 2013, and generally taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States.

We continue to benefit from a significant proportion of profits being foreign-derived, and generally taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,

96%

,

103%

and

92%

, respectively, of our pre-tax income was derived from foreign sources. Our foreign pre-tax income is subject to tax in multiple foreign jurisdictions, virtually all of which have statutory income tax rates lower than the United States. While the income tax imposed by any one foreign country is not material to us, our overall effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both foreign and domestic. Certain portions of our foreign source income are subject to United States federal and state income tax as earned due to the nature of the income, and dividend repatriations of our foreign source income are generally subject to United States federal and state income tax.

We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of

December 31, 2014

, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was

$96.8 million

, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows.



Earnings per share

During the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, basic earnings per share were

$1.60

,

$1.43

and

$1.70

, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were

$1.59

,

$1.43

and

$1.69

, respectively. Outstanding options to purchase Western Union stock and unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of

December 31, 2014

,


and


, there were

15.5 million

,

21.2 million

and

23.3 million

, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti-dilutive.

Fluctuations in our earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 compared to the prior year are a result of the previously described factors impacting net income and lower weighted-average shares outstanding. For both the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 compared to the prior year, the lower number of shares outstanding was due to stock repurchases exceeding stock issuances related to the Company's stock compensation programs.

Segment Discussion

We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our three segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions. Businesses and services not considered part of these segments are categorized as "Other."

The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the following principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments' revenue compared to total revenue.

•

Costs incurred for the review and closing of acquisitions are included in "Other."

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments.

The following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.



Consumer-to-Consumer Segment

The following table sets forth our Consumer-to-Consumer segment results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.

We view our Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer service as one interconnected global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the world. The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are limited to generating, managing and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities and also includes our online money transfer service conducted through Western Union branded websites ("westernunion.com"). By means of common processes and systems, these regions and westernunion.com create an interconnected network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one global Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment.

Significant allocations are made in determining the transaction and revenue changes under the regional view in the tables that follow. The geographic split for transactions and revenue is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions are attributed to that region. For money transfers initiated through our websites, 100% of the revenue and transactions are attributed to westernunion.com.



Due to the significance of our Consumer-to-Consumer segment to our overall results and the effect that foreign exchange fluctuations against the United States dollar can have on our reported revenues, constant currency results have been provided in the tables below. Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure and is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

____________

(a)

Constant currency revenue growth assumes that revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.

(b)

For the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, the foreign exchange translation impact is primarily the result of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Argentine peso and other South American currencies.

We provide domestic money transfer services (transactions between and within the United States and Canada), which are included in North America and westernunion.com in the tables above. These services represented approximately 8% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.



Our consumers transferred

$85.4 billion

, $82.0 billion, and $79.3 billion in Consumer-to-Consumer principal for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which

$77.2 billion

, $73.9 billion, and $71.3 billion related to cross-border principal, for the same corresponding periods described above.

Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues

2014 compared to 2013

For the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer revenue increased

1%

, driven by strong results in westernunion.com. Revenue increased primarily due to transaction growth of

5%

, partially offset by price reductions and geographic and product mix. For the year ended December 31, 2014, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, negatively impacted revenue by 2%.

Our Europe and CIS region experienced flat revenue on transaction growth of

9%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue was negatively impacted by geographic and product mix and price reductions. Russia experienced strong transaction growth for most of the year but such growth moderated significantly toward the end of 2014; Russia typically generates lower revenue per transaction than the average in this region.

Our North America region experienced revenue growth of

1%

, on transaction growth of

3%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue primarily resulted from transaction growth in our United States outbound and Mexico corridors and was offset by declines in our domestic money transfer services. Our domestic money transfer services in the United States were negatively impacted by declines in higher principal band transactions, which generate higher revenue per transaction, primarily due to competitive prices in the retail money transfer market. We expect these competitive prices will continue to affect our domestic money transfer services in 2015.

Our Middle East and Africa region experienced revenue growth of

2%

, on transaction growth of

3%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, partially offset by declines in several African countries, including Libya.

Our APAC region experienced flat revenue on transaction growth of

1%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. The differential between the revenue and transaction change was primarily due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other foreign currencies in the region, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, partially offset by geographic and product mix.

Our LACA region experienced decreased revenue of

6%

, and transaction growth of

3%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. Revenue was negatively impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Argentine peso and other foreign currencies in the region and by government imposed restrictions on the market in Venezuela.

Westernunion.com experienced revenue growth of

28%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, on transaction growth of

39%

.

Foreign exchange revenues increased

2%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the previous year, primarily due to a 5% increase in cross-border principal.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges, have resulted in a reduction to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 of

$80.7 million

over the previous year.



We have historically implemented and will likely continue to implement price reductions from time to time in response to competition and other factors. Price reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently. Consumer-to-Consumer price reductions totaled approximately 1% of both our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue and consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.

2013 compared to 2012

For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer revenue declined 3% primarily due to price reductions and compliance related actions in various corridors. Transactions increased 5% from 2012, primarily due to price reductions.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented additional fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign exchange spreads that impacted approximately 25% of our Consumer-to-Consumer business, based on 2012 revenue. We had initiated substantially all of these pricing reductions as of June 30, 2013. These pricing actions totaled approximately 5% of consolidated revenue and 7% of our Consumer-to-Consumer revenue, for the full year 2013.

The regions discussed below were impacted by price reductions in certain key corridors and compliance related actions in various corridors.

For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, revenue in our Europe and CIS region decreased 4% on transaction growth of 4%. Revenue was negatively impacted by price reductions, compliance related actions in various countries, including in the United Kingdom and Spain, competitive challenges in Russia, and continued economic softness in Southern Europe, partially offset by revenue growth in Germany.

For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, our North America region experienced revenue declines of 9% on flat transactions. Our North America region was impacted by Mexico, where revenue declined due to price reductions and compliance related actions resulting from our settlement agreement with the State of Arizona and changes to our business model, primarily for our Vigo

®

and Orlandi Valuta

SM

brands. These changes resulted in the loss of over 7,000 agent locations in the third quarter of 2012. Transactions increased in Mexico for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to price reductions, partially offset by the impact of compliance related actions described earlier in this paragraph. Our North America region was also impacted by our United States outbound corridor, which also experienced a decline in revenue due to price reductions and compliance related actions resulting from our settlement agreement with the State of Arizona and changes to our business model, primarily impacting our Vigo brand to Latin America, and other compliance related actions.

For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, our Middle East and Africa and APAC regions experienced flat revenue and a revenue decline of 3%, respectively. Both regions experienced transaction growth in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year. The differential between revenue and transaction changes for both regions was primarily attributable to price reductions.

Our LACA region experienced revenue declines for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year due to compliance related actions resulting from our settlement agreement with the State of Arizona and changes to our business model, primarily impacting our Vigo brand, and other compliance related actions. Revenue was also negatively impacted by pricing actions and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies in the region, partially offset by geographic and product mix. Transactions decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of compliance related actions described earlier, partially offset by price reductions.

Revenue generated from transactions initiated at westernunion.com increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year due to strong transaction growth, partially offset by price reductions.

Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year were impacted primarily by price reductions in certain corridors, partially offset by an increase in cross-border principal sent of 4%.



Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $29.6 million over the same period in the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates.

Operating income

2014 compared to 2013

Consumer-to-Consumer operating income increased

2%

during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to the revenue increases described above and benefits from our productivity and cost-savings initiatives. These increases were partially offset by higher agent commissions, which generally increase as revenue increases, including increases in agent commission rates in our walk-in services primarily due to the renewal of certain strategic agent agreements, and increased compliance program costs. The change in operating income margins in the segment was due to the same factors mentioned above.

2013 compared to 2012

Consumer-to-Consumer operating income declined 19% during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily due to the investments in our strategic initiatives, the revenue decline described earlier, increased compliance program costs, lower compensation expense in 2012, and expenses associated with our productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by savings from these initiatives and decreased marketing expenses. The change in operating income margins in the segment was due to the same factors mentioned above.

Consumer-to-Business Segment

The following table sets forth our Consumer-to-Business segment results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.

Revenues

2014 compared to 2013

Consumer-to-Business revenue decreased

2%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, which negatively impacted our Consumer-to-Business revenue growth by 12%, and declines in our United States cash-based bill payments. These decreases were partially offset by growth in our United States electronic bill payments.



2013 compared to 2012

Consumer-to-Business revenue increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, primarily due to growth in our United States electronic and international walk-in bill payments, which was positively impacted by increased pricing in Argentina. These increases were partially offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Argentine peso, which negatively impacted our Consumer-to-Business revenue growth by approximately 5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, revenue declines in our United States cash-based bill payments, and the passing through to certain billers of some of our debit card fee savings related to the Durbin Legislation.

Operating income

2014 compared to 2013

Operating income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to higher bank-related fees resulting from changes in funding in our growing United States electronic bill payments as a result of increased credit card usage from our customers and larger principal transactions, in addition to the items which impacted revenues described earlier. The change in operating margins in the segment was due to these same factors.

2013 compared to 2012

Operating income and operating margins decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily due to the items which impacted revenues described earlier. Operating income was also impacted by increased bank fees due to our growing United States electronic services and higher information technology investments, partially offset by costs related to the renegotiation of a sales and distribution agreement that occurred in the prior year.

Business Solutions

The following table sets forth our Business Solutions segment results of operations for the years ended

December 31, 2014

.

____________

*

Calculation not meaningful.

Revenues

2014 compared to 2013

Business Solutions revenue grew

3%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year due to increased customer activity, including the increased use of hedging products. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1%.



2013 compared to 2012

For the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year, Business Solutions revenue grew due to increased spot payments activity and increased customer hedging. We believe the increase in customer hedging activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 was partially driven by the level of certain major currencies against the United States dollar. The strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2%. Additionally, the acquisition of the French assets of TGBP, which was completed in May 2012 after receiving regulatory approval, contributed approximately 1% to the segment's revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Operating loss

2014 compared to 2013

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the operating loss decreased compared to the prior year due to decreased TGBP integration expenses and the revenue increases described above, partially offset by higher bank fees and increased compliance program costs. The change in operating loss margins in the segment was due to these same factors.

2013 compared to 2012

For the year ended December 31, 2013, the operating loss decreased compared to the prior year due to increased revenue, partially offset by increased strategic investments. Additionally, operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 was impacted by decreased integration expenses. The change in operating loss margins in the segment was due to these same factors.

Other

Calculation not meaningful.

Revenues

2014 compared to 2013

Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in our retail walk-in foreign exchange services resulting from our acquisition of Fitta, and increased investment income in our money order business, partially offset by declines in our prepaid services.

2013 compared to 2012

Other revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year primarily due to declines in our prepaid services.



Operating income/(loss)

2014 compared to 2013

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated operating income due to increased operating income in our prepaid services and increased investment income in our money order business.

2013 compared to 2012

Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 was materially consistent with the corresponding period in the prior year.



Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings and timing of income tax payments, among other items. The significant majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters.

Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control, including changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting migrant populations and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters.

A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which are regulated entities. Our regulated subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, including: 1) requirements to maintain cash and other qualifying investment balances, free of any liens or other encumbrances, related to the payment of certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations and 2) other legal or regulatory restrictions, including statutory or formalized net worth requirements. Assets subject to these other legal or regulatory restrictions totaled approximately

$300 million

as of

December 31, 2014

, and include assets outside of the United States subject to restrictions from being transferred outside of the countries where these assets are located.

We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, service our debt obligations, pay dividends, and repurchase shares through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations. To help ensure availability of our worldwide cash where needed, we utilize a variety of planning and financial strategies, including decisions related to the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is repatriated or otherwise made available from our international subsidiaries. These decisions can influence our overall tax rate and impact our total liquidity.

We also have the capacity to borrow up to $

1.65 billion

in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility"), which supports borrowings under our $

1.5 billion

commercial paper program and expires in January 2017. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

no

outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or commercial paper program.

Cash and Investment Securities

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had cash and cash equivalents of

$1.8 billion

, of which approximately $950 million was held by our foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash balances to fluctuate.

Repatriating foreign earnings to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these earnings have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. Over the last several years, such earnings have been used to pay for our international acquisitions and operations and provide initial Company funding of global principal payouts for Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions transactions. We regularly evaluate, taking tax consequences and other factors into consideration, our United States cash requirements and also the potential uses of cash internationally to determine the appropriate level of dividend repatriations of our foreign source income.

In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as "Settlement assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as "Cash and cash equivalents" within "Settlement assets," to fund settlement obligations.



Investment securities, classified within "Settlement assets," were

$1.5 billion

as of

December 31, 2014

and consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, including fixed rate term notes and variable rate demand notes. The substantial majority of our investment securities are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of "A-" or better from a major credit rating agency.

Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of

December 31, 2014

, all investments with a single issuer and each individual security were less than 10% of our investment securities portfolio.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

During the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, cash provided by operating activities was

$1,045.9 million

,

$1,088.6 million

and

$1,185.3 million

, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was impacted by tax payments of $92.4 million made as a result of the agreement reached in December 2011 with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003 ("IRS Agreement"). Cash provided by operating activities is impacted by changes to our consolidated operating income, in addition to fluctuations in our working capital balances, among other factors.



Financing Resources

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions):

____________



Commercial Paper Program

Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed

$1.5 billion

outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility in excess of

$150 million

. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $13.3 million, and the maximum balance outstanding was $200.0 million. We had a maximum balance outstanding of $50 million for one day during the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $161.3 million, and the maximum balance outstanding was $422.8 million. Proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general corporate purposes.

Revolving Credit Facility

On September 23, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement which expires January 2017 providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of

$1.65 billion

, including a

$250.0 million

letter of credit sub-facility and a

$150.0 million

swing line sub-facility.

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of


basis points. A facility fee of


basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our credit ratings.

The purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 17 participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short-term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of

$1.65 billion

is approximately 12%. As of and during the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, we had

no

outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.

Notes

On November 22, 2013, we issued

$250.0 million

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due May 22, 2019 ("2019 Notes"). Interest with respect to the 2019 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 22 and November 22 of each year, beginning on May 22, 2014, based on the fixed per annum rate of

3.350%

. The interest rate payable on the 2019 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to the note is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on the 2019 Notes be increased by more than 2.00% above 3.350% per annum. The interest rate payable on the 2019 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below 3.350% per annum. We may redeem the 2019 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


basis points.

On August 22, 2013, we issued

$250.0 million

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due August 21, 2015 ("2015 Floating Rate Notes"). Interest with respect to the 2015 Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on each February 21, May 21, August 21, and November 21, beginning November 21, 2013, at a per annum rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus

1.0%

(reset quarterly).



On December 10, 2012, we issued

$250.0 million

and

$500.0 million

of aggregate principal amounts of unsecured notes due December 10, 2015 ("2015 Fixed Rate Notes") and December 10, 2017 ("2017 Notes"), respectively. Interest with respect to the 2015 Fixed Rate Notes and 2017 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 10 and December 10 of each year, currently based on the per annum rates of

2.375%

and

2.875%

, respectively. The interest rates payable on the 2015 Fixed Rate Notes and 2017 Notes will be increased if the debt rating assigned to such notes is downgraded by an applicable credit rating agency, beginning at a downgrade below investment grade. However, in no event will the interest rate on either the 2015 Fixed Rate Notes or 2017 Notes be increased by more than

2.00%

above

2.375%

and

2.875%

per annum, respectively. The interest rates on the 2015 Fixed Rate Notes and 2017 Notes may also be adjusted downward for debt rating upgrades subsequent to any debt rating downgrades but may not be adjusted below

2.375%

and

2.875%

per annum, respectively. We may redeem the 2015 Fixed Rate Notes and 2017 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


and


basis points, respectively.

On August 22, 2011, we issued

$400.0 million

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due August 22, 2018 ("2018 Notes"). Interest with respect to the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 22 and August 22 of each year, based on the fixed per annum rate of

3.650%

. We may redeem the 2018 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


basis points.

On June 21, 2010, we issued

$250.0 million

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 ("2040 Notes"). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of

6.200%

. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


basis points.

On March 30, 2010, we exchanged

$303.7 million

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2011 ("2011 Notes") for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020 ("2020 Notes"). Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of

5.253%

. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a

7% premium

(

$21.2 million

), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be accreted into "Interest expense” over the life of the notes. We may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


basis points.

On November 17, 2006, we issued

$500.0 million

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2036 ("2036 Notes"). Interest with respect to the 2036 Notes is payable semi-annually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of

6.200%

. We may redeem the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


basis points.

On September 29, 2006, we issued

$1.0 billion

of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016 ("2016 Notes"). Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum rate of

5.930%

. We may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus


basis points.



Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants

The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business, managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and the overall business.

Our Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest rate margin and facility fee which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, the interest rates payable on our 2015 Fixed Rate Notes, 2017 Notes and 2019 Notes can be impacted by our credit ratings. We are also subject to certain provisions in many of our notes and certain of our derivative contracts, which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements that are tied to changes in our credit ratings.

Our Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2016 Notes, 2020 Notes and the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. Our Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum of (a) interest expense; (b) income tax expense; (c) depreciation expense; (d) amortization expense; (e) any other non-cash deductions, losses or changes made in determining net income for such period; and (f) extraordinary losses or charges, minus extraordinary gains, in each case determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 8:1 for the year ended

December 31, 2014

.

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes.

Cash Priorities

Liquidity

Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business.

Capital Expenditures

The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment and purchased and developed software was

$179.0 million

,

$241.3 million

and

$268.2 million

in


,


and


, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during these periods included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

During the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


,

29.3 million

,

25.7 million

and

51.0 million

shares, respectively, have been repurchased for

$488.1 million

,

$393.6 million

and

$771.9 million

, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of

$16.63

,

$15.29

and

$15.12

per share, respectively. As of

December 31, 2014

,

$11.9 million

remained available under the share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors through June 30, 2015.

On February 10, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized $1.2 billion of common stock repurchases through December 31, 2017.



Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per common share in all four quarters of 2014 and 2013, representing

$265.2 million

and $277.2 million, respectively, in total dividends. During 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share in the fourth quarter and $0.10 per common share in the first three quarters, representing $254.2 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective quarter the dividend was declared, except for the September 2012 declared dividend, which was paid in October 2012.

On

February 10, 2015

, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.155

per common share payable on

March 31, 2015

.

Debt Service Requirements

Our 2015 and future debt service requirements will include payments on any existing and future borrowings under our commercial paper program and interest payments on all outstanding indebtedness. In August and December 2015, our 2015 Floating Rate Notes of $

250.0 million

and 2015 Fixed Rate Notes of $

250.0 million

, respectively, will mature. We plan to fund both maturities with a combination of cash, including cash generated from operations, and debt, including issuing commercial paper, as the borrowings come due.

Our ability to continue to grow the business, make investments in our business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including through dividends and share repurchases, and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, Note 12, "Operating Lease Commitments," we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.



Pension Plan

We have a frozen defined benefit pension plan ("Plan"), for which we had a recorded unfunded pension obligation of

$74.9 million

and

$70.4 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. During the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, we made contributions of

$13.2 million

and

$15.7 million

, respectively, to the Plan. We will be required to fund approximately

$18 million

to the Plan in 2015.

Our most recent measurement date for our pension plan was

December 31, 2014

. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost is dependent upon three primary assumptions: 1) expected long-term return on plan assets; 2) discount rate; and 3) life expectancy trends.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical risk, return, and co-variance relationships between equities, fixed-income securities, and alternative investments are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to diversification, re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical returns are reviewed within the context of current economic conditions to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five-year period. Our expected long-term return on plan assets was

7.00%

for both


and


. The expected long-term return on plan assets is

7.00%

for 2015. As of our December 31, 2014 measurement date, pension plan target allocations were approximately

20%

in equity investments,

60%

in debt securities and

20%

in alternative investment strategies (e.g. hedge funds, royalty rights and private equity funds). Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to: equity long/short, commodities/currencies, relative value, event driven and multi-strategy. The Plan holds interest rate derivative contracts directly, including interest rate futures that are based on U.S. Treasury bond rates ranging from two years to twenty-five years. The Plan may also hold interest rate swaps, under which the Plan is committed to pay or receive a short-term LIBOR-based variable interest rate in exchange for a fixed interest rate, primarily based on five and ten-year maturities. Additionally, derivatives are held indirectly through funds in which the Plan is invested. Derivatives are used by the Plan to help reduce the Plan's exposure to interest rate volatility and to provide an additional source of return. Cash held by the Plan is used to satisfy margin requirements on the derivatives or meet liquidity needs, including benefit payments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.

The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was

3.27%

and

3.91%

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense.

The assumptions related to life expectancy are used to estimate the expected period over which pension benefits will be required to be paid. Projections used for life expectancy are based on mortality tables and mortality improvement tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates and expected future mortality improvements, respectively. We utilize a mortality table that best aligns with the underlying demographics and census data of the Plan participants. For the year ended December 31, 2014, based on updates to the most relevant mortality assumptions that align to the demographics of the Plan participants, life expectancies were shown to be longer, resulting in a pre-tax actuarial loss of $18 million included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and a corresponding increase to the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of

December 31, 2014

and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):

____________



Other Commercial Commitments

We had approximately

$210 million

in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of

December 31, 2014

. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements, certain agent agreements, and in relation to an uncertain tax position. The letters of credit and bank guarantees have expiration dates through


, with the majority having a one-year renewal option. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances. The bank guarantees related to the uncertain tax position were extinguished in January 2015 after resolution of the related matter.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,

Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition.

Income Taxes

Reinvestment of foreign earnings

Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments.

However, no provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes on certain of our outside tax basis differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately

$5.6 billion

as of

December 31, 2014

, which we have reinvested and expect to continue to reinvest outside of the United States indefinitely. Over the last several years, such earnings have been used to pay for our international acquisitions and operations and provide initial Company funding of global principal payouts for Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions transactions. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to United States federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the period such distribution occurred. Determination of the amount of unrecognized United States deferred tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Income tax contingencies

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. Our tax reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.



We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (the "Spin-off"). Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement signed in connection with the Spin-off from First Data, we believe we have appropriately apportioned the taxes between First Data and us. If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions, including those related to the Spin-off, as of

December 31, 2014

were

$96.8 million

, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differs from our estimates, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivatives to (a) minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency Business Solutions payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in "Other assets" and "Other liabilities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.

•

Cash Flow hedges - Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. The portions of the change in fair value that are either considered ineffective or are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in "Derivative gains/(losses), net."

•

Fair Value hedges - Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, are recorded in "Interest expense."

The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements. The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis. If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively.

While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported results. As of

December 31, 2014

, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized gains classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss from such cash flow hedges that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $42.4 million. As of

December 31, 2014

, the cumulative debt adjustments from our fair value hedges that would be reflected in earnings if such hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was a

$5.3 million

gain.

Other Intangible Assets

We capitalize acquired intangible assets as well as certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts and software. We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required.



The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the amount to capitalize and the related period of benefit. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. Additionally, the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions, including, among other things, revenue growth rates, and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans.

Disruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset. If an event described above occurs and causes us to determine that an asset has been impaired, that could result in an impairment charge. The net carrying value of our other intangible assets as of

December 31, 2014

was

$748.1 million

. We recorded immaterial impairments related to other intangible assets during the years ended

December 31, 2014

and 2013, and did not record any impairment during the year ended December 31,


.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations. An impairment assessment of goodwill is conducted annually as of October 1 at the reporting unit level. This assessment of goodwill is performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Reporting units are determined by the level at which management reviews segment operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment and in others it is one level below the operating segment.

Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The initial qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results. Additionally, each reporting unit's fair value is assessed under certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity-specific events. Periodically, we perform a quantitative assessment, as described below, for each of our reporting units, regardless of the results of prior qualitative assessments.

If it is determined in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the standard two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. First, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated or determined using discounted cash flows and is compared to its carrying value. If the first step indicates the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the second step is required. The second step is to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the determined fair value to all the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The remaining fair value of the reporting unit, if any, is deemed to be the implied fair value of the goodwill and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill above its implied fair value.

The determination of the reporting units and which reporting units to include in the qualitative assessment requires significant judgment. Also, all of the assumptions used in the qualitative assessment require judgment. Additionally, for the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we calculate the fair value of reporting units through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected regulatory, marketplace, and other economic factors as well as relevant discount rates and terminal values.

We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the period such charge occurs.



The carrying value of goodwill as of

December 31, 2014

was

$3,169.2 million

which represented approximately 32% of our consolidated assets. As of

December 31, 2014

, goodwill of

$1,950.1 million

and

$996.0 million

resides in our Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions reporting units, respectively. The remaining

$223.1 million

resides in multiple reporting units which are included in either our Consumer-to-Business segment or Other. For the reporting units that comprise Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business, and Other, the fair value of the businesses greatly exceed their carrying amounts.

For our Business Solutions reporting unit, which was acquired between 2009 and 2011, a decline in estimated fair value of approximately 15% as of the testing date could occur before triggering an impairment of goodwill. The fair value calculation for Business Solutions is highly sensitive to changes in projections for revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins. Our current expectation is for Business Solutions to average high single digit annual revenue growth over the 10-year forecast period, with average low double digit rates in the earlier years, driven by continued growth in global trade and increases in market share. EBITDA margins are highly dependent on revenue growth, as over half of the Business Solutions cost base is fixed. Our ability to achieve the projected revenue growth may be affected by, amongst other factors, (a) pricing and product competition from direct competitors, banks and new market entrants; (b) our success and speed to market in developing new products; (c) the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the United States dollar; (d) increased regulatory compliance requirements; (e) our ability to enter relationships with partners that can accelerate our time to market; (f) failure of long-term import growth rates returning to historic levels; (g) our ability to continue to maintain our payment network and bank account infrastructure; and (h) foreign currency volatility impacts on customer activity.

We believe that if Business Solutions is unable to achieve the projected financial performance, either in the near term or long term, impairment is likely to result. Based on assumptions used within the Business Solutions reporting unit valuation, we believe a decrease of 75 basis points in the ten-year compound annual growth rate of revenue (also reflecting the impact such a reduction would have on EBITDA margins) would result in a reduction in the fair value of the Business Solutions reporting unit of approximately $250 million. Such a reduction would result in the fair value approximating the carrying value of the reporting unit.

We did not record any goodwill impairments during the three years ended

December 31, 2014

.

Legal Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. When a potential loss is considered probable and the reasonable estimate is a range, we accrue on the low end of the range when no amount is a better estimate than any other amount. There may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable including our evaluation of outcomes when a range exists. Our judgments are subjective based on considerations such as the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultations with in-house and outside legal counsel. Since the outcome of these matters is uncertain, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates which may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on motions to dispose, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others.

Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate and the varied range of potential outcomes, our judgments may be materially different than the actual resolutions.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We provide Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer services in more than


countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid by the next day after they are initiated. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into short duration foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also have exposure to certain foreign currency denominated cash and other asset and liability positions and may utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with maturities of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on these positions. In certain consumer money transfer and Business Solutions transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire the currency, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. We promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies.

We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Consumer-to-Consumer revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and to a lesser degree the Canadian dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, and other currencies. We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year. We believe the use of longer-term foreign currency forward contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our international Consumer-to-Consumer operations.

We have money transfer and bill payment operations in Argentina, which together represented less than 5% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and 2013. Government-imposed restrictions limit the transfer of funds from those operations out of the country. As of

December 31, 2014

, we held in Argentina less than $65 million in cash and cash equivalents denominated in the Argentine peso, a portion of which will be used to satisfy our non-settlement related Argentine peso denominated liabilities. The impact of changes in the official Argentine peso exchange rate is immediately reflected in net income for our money transfer operations, and this impact is reflected in other comprehensive income/(loss) for our bill payment operations. Any further devaluation of the Argentine peso and any additional limits on transferring funds out of Argentina could further adversely affect the value of those cash and cash equivalents, our ability to distribute them, and our results of operations.

We have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our Business Solutions business. The majority of this business' revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency payments. In certain countries, this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year. Business Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties.



As of

December 31, 2014

, a hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our net income is generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre-tax annual income of approximately $25 million, based on our forecast of Consumer-to-Consumer unhedged exposure to foreign currency at that date. There are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static, and that we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income.

Interest Rates

We invest in several types of interest-bearing assets, with a total value as of

December 31, 2014

of $3.3 billion. Approximately $2.5 billion of these assets bear interest at floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. These assets primarily include cash in banks, money market instruments, and state and municipal variable rate securities and are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within "Cash and cash equivalents" and "Settlement assets." To the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as "Settlement assets." Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short-term interest rates.

The majority of the remainder of our interest-bearing assets consist of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities which are fixed rate term notes. These investments may include investments made from cash received from our money order services, money transfer business, and other related payment services awaiting redemption classified within "Settlement assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed-rate interest-bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available-for-sale within "Settlement assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our "Total stockholders' equity" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had

$250.0 million

of floating rate notes, which had an effective interest rate of 1.2% or 1% above three-month LIBOR. Additionally,

$975.0 million

of our fixed-rate borrowings at par value are effectively floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements, changing this fixed-rate debt to LIBOR-based floating rate debt, with weighted-average spreads of approximately 200 basis points above LIBOR.

We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest-bearing assets as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. As of

December 31, 2014

, our weighted-average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately

4.4%

.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre-tax income of approximately $12 million and $18 million annually based on borrowings, net of the impact of hedges on

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on

December 31, 2014

and


that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, would result in an annual benefit/reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $25 million and $28 million, respectively. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time. We will also be further impacted by changes to future interest rates as we refinance our debt or by reinvesting proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments.



Credit Risk

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market fund investments, derivatives and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions.

We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment and money order settlement process. We perform a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic analyses. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our online services and electronic channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash, and therefore are subject to "chargebacks," insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud, which are anticipated to increase as online services and electronic channels become a greater proportion of our money transfer business.

We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers. For the derivatives, the duration of these contracts at inception is generally less than one year. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. For those receivables where we have offered trade credit, collection ordinarily occurs within a few days. To mitigate the risk associated with potential customer defaults, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis, and, for our derivatives, we may require certain customers to post or increase collateral.

Our losses associated with bad debts have been 1% or less of our consolidated revenues in all periods presented.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All other financial statement schedules for The Western Union Company have been omitted since the required information is not present or not present in amounts sufficient to require submission of the schedule, or because the information required is included in the respective consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.



Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Western Union Company's ("Western Union" or the "Company") internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Western Union's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board of Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Western Union's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on the results of its evaluation, the Company's management concluded that as of

December 31, 2014

, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective. Western Union's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Western Union's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union Company

We have audited The Western Union Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). The Western Union Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Formation of the Entity and Basis of Presentation

The Western Union Company ("Western Union" or the "Company") is a leader in global money movement and payment services, providing people and businesses with fast, reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments around the world. The Western Union

®

brand is globally recognized. The Company's services are primarily available through a network of agent locations in more than


countries and territories. Each location in the Company's agent network is capable of providing one or more of the Company's services.

The Western Union business consists of the following segments:

•

Consumer-to-Consumer - The Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment facilitates money transfers between two consumers, primarily through a network of third-party agents. The Company's multi-currency, real-time money transfer service is viewed by the Company as one interconnected global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the world. This service is available for international cross-border transfers - that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another - and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers - that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. This segment also includes money transfer transactions that can be initiated through websites, mobile devices, and account based money transfers.

•

Consumer-to-Business - The Consumer-to-Business operating segment facilitates bill payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. The

significant majority

of the segment's revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented, with the remainder primarily generated in Argentina.

•

Business Solutions - The Business Solutions operating segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals. The

majority

of the segment's business relates to exchanges of currency at the spot rate which enables customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, the Company writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments.

All businesses that have not been classified in the above segments are reported as "Other" and include the Company's money order and other services, in addition to costs for the review and closing of acquisitions.

There are legal or regulatory limitations on transferring certain assets of the Company outside of the countries where these assets are located. However, there are generally no limitations on the use of these assets within those countries. Additionally, the Company must meet minimum capital requirements in some countries in order to maintain operating licenses. As of

December 31, 2014

, the amount of net assets subject to these limitations totaled approximately

$300 million

.

Various aspects of the Company's services and businesses are subject to United States federal, state and local regulation, as well as regulation by foreign jurisdictions, including certain banking and other financial services regulations.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Spin-off from First Data

On January 26, 2006, the First Data Corporation ("First Data") Board of Directors announced its intention to pursue the distribution of all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (the "Spin-off"). Effective on September 29, 2006, First Data completed the separation and the distribution of these businesses by distributing The Western Union Company common stock to First Data shareholders (the "Distribution"). Prior to the Distribution, the Company had been a segment of First Data.

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Consistent with industry practice, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are unclassified due to the short-term nature of the Company's settlement obligations contrasted with the Company's ability to invest cash awaiting settlement in long-term investment securities.

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company consolidates financial results when it has both the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the ability to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting when it is able to exercise significant influence over the entity's operations, which generally occurs when the Company has an ownership interest of between

20%

and

50%

in an entity.

Earnings Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Outstanding options to purchase Western Union stock and unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise price of stock options, the unamortized compensation expense and assumed tax benefits of options and restricted stock are available to acquire shares at an average market price throughout the period, and therefore, reduce the dilutive effect.

For the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, there were

15.5 million

,

21.2 million

and

23.3 million

, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The following table provides the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding (in millions):

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair values of its assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in accordance with the hierarchy described below. The fair values of the assets and liabilities held in the Company's defined benefit plan trust ("Trust") are recognized or disclosed utilizing the same hierarchy. The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

•

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. For most of these assets, the Company utilizes pricing services that use multiple prices as inputs to determine daily market values. In addition, the Trust has other investments that fall within Level 2 that are valued at net asset value which is not quoted on an active market; however, the unit price is based on underlying investments which are traded on an active market. The individual redemption restrictions of Trust investments measured at net asset value are also considered when determining whether Level 2 classification is appropriate.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include items where the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The Company has Level 3 assets that are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis related to the Company's business combinations, where the values of the intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a purchase are derived utilizing one of the three recognized approaches: the market approach, the income approach or the cost approach.

Carrying amounts for many of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, and settlement receivables and settlement obligations approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Investment securities and derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and included in Note 8. Fixed rate notes are carried at their original issuance values as adjusted over time to accrete that value to par, except for portions of notes hedged by interest rate swap agreements as disclosed in Note 14. The fair values of fixed rate notes are also disclosed in Note 8 and are based on market quotations. For more information on the fair value of financial instruments, see Note 8.

The fair values of non-financial assets and liabilities related to the Company's business combinations are disclosed in Note 4. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities related to the Trust are disclosed in Note 11.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for all business combinations where control over another entity is obtained using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that most assets (both tangible and intangible), liabilities (including contingent consideration), and remaining noncontrolling interests be recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets less liabilities and noncontrolling interests is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets, liabilities, or noncontrolling interests made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is one year or less, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Any cost or equity method interest that the Company holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is remeasured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value and existing book value. Results of operations of the acquired company are included in the Company's results from the date of the acquisition forward and include amortization expense arising from acquired intangible assets. The Company expenses all costs as incurred related to or involved with an acquisition in "Selling, general and administrative" expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments (other than those included in settlement assets) with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase (that are readily convertible to cash) are considered to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with various financial institutions, including a portion in money market funds. The Company limits the concentration of its cash and cash equivalents with any one institution. The Company regularly reviews investment concentrations and credit worthiness of these institutions, and has relationships with a globally diversified list of banks and financial institutions.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the related receivable balance will not be collected based on its history of collection experience, known collection issues, such as agent suspensions and bankruptcies, and other matters the Company identifies in its routine collection monitoring. The allowance for doubtful accounts was

$37.2 million

and

$38.3 million

as of

Settlement Assets and Obligations

Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received from agents for unsettled money transfers, money orders and consumer payments. The Company records corresponding settlement obligations relating to amounts payable under money transfers, money orders and consumer payment service arrangements. Settlement assets and obligations also include amounts receivable from, and payable to, customers for the value of their cross-currency payment transactions related to the Business Solutions segment.

Settlement assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables from selling agents and Business Solutions customers, and investment securities. Cash received by Western Union agents generally becomes available to the Company within one week after initial receipt by the agent. Cash equivalents consist of short-term time deposits, commercial paper and other highly liquid investments. Receivables from selling agents represent funds collected by such agents, but in transit to the Company. Western Union has a large and diverse agent base, thereby reducing the credit risk of the Company from any one agent. In addition, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its agents' financial condition and credit worthiness. See Note 7 for information concerning the Company's investment securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Receivables from Business Solutions customers arise from cross-currency payment transactions in the Business Solutions segment. Receivables occur when funds have been paid out to a beneficiary but not yet received from the customer. Aside from these receivables, the credit risk associated with spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely mitigated, as in most cases the Company requires the receipt of funds from customers before releasing the associated cross-currency payment.

Settlement obligations consist of money transfer, money order and payment service payables and payables to agents. Money transfer payables represent amounts to be paid to transferees when they request their funds. Most agents typically settle with transferees first and then obtain reimbursement from the Company. Money order payables represent amounts not yet presented for payment. Payment service payables represent amounts to be paid to utility companies, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and others. Due to the agent funding and settlement process, payables to agents represent amounts due to agents for money transfers that have been settled with transferees.

Settlement assets and obligations consisted of the following (in millions):

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated life of the related assets (generally three to 10 years for equipment and furniture and fixtures, and


years for buildings) or the lease term. Maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are charged to expense as incurred.

Property and equipment consisted of the following (in millions):

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations. The Company's annual impairment assessment did not identify any goodwill impairment during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets primarily consist of acquired contracts, contract costs (primarily amounts paid to agents in connection with establishing and renewing long-term contracts) and software. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract or benefit periods. Included in the Consolidated Statements of Income is amortization expense of

$205.3 million

,

$198.6 million

and

$184.4 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively.

Acquired contracts include customer and contractual relationships and networks of subagents that are recognized in connection with the Company's acquisitions.

The Company capitalizes initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts to the extent recoverable through future operations or penalties in the case of early termination. The Company's accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees the Company would receive in the event of early termination of the contract.

The Company purchases and develops software that is used in providing services and in performing administrative functions. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of the software has been established. Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established when the Company has completed all planning and designing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general use. Software development costs and purchased software are generally amortized over a term of

three

to

five

years.

The following table provides the components of other intangible assets (in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The estimated future aggregate amortization expense for existing other intangible assets as of

Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their carrying values to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required. The Company recorded immaterial impairments related to other intangible assets during the years ended

December 31, 2014

and

December 31, 2013

, and did not record any impairment during the year ended December 31,


.

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenues are primarily derived from consumer money transfer transaction fees that are based on the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which funds are transferred. The Company also offers several payments services, including payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. Transaction fees are set by the Company and recorded as revenue at the time of sale.

In certain consumer money transfer and Business Solutions transactions involving different send and receive currencies, the Company generates revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by the Company to the consumer or business and the rate at which the Company or its agents are able to acquire the currency. This foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the related consumer money transfer transaction fee revenue is recognized or at the time a customer initiates a transaction through the Company's Business Solutions payment service operations.

Cost of Services

Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions and expenses for call centers, settlement operations and related information technology costs. Expenses within these functions include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation, amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


were

$162.7 million

,

$165.1 million

and

$177.5 million

, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be determined based on the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance must be established when, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

Foreign Currency Translation

The United States dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company's businesses. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for those businesses for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into United States dollars based on exchange rates at the end of the year. The effects of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of assets and liabilities of these businesses are included as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of businesses for which the United States dollar is the functional currency are remeasured based on exchange rates at the end of the period, and the resulting remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in net income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of these operations are remeasured at historical rates in effect when the asset was recognized or the liability was incurred.

Derivatives

The Company uses derivatives to (a) minimize its exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency Business Solutions payments by writing derivatives to customers. The Company recognizes all derivatives in the "Other assets" and "Other liabilities" captions in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. All cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

•

Cash Flow hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss." Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged. The portions of the change in fair value that are either considered ineffective or are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in "Derivative gains/(losses), net."

•

Fair Value hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt are recorded in "Interest expense." The offsetting change in value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate is also recorded in "Interest expense."

•

Undesignated - Derivative contracts entered into to reduce the variability related to (a) money transfer settlement assets and obligations, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, and (b) certain foreign currency denominated cash and other asset and liability positions, typically with maturities of less than one year at inception, are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in their fair value are included in "Selling, general and administrative." The Company is also exposed to risk from derivative contracts written to its customers arising from its cross-currency Business Solutions payments operations. The duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year. The Company aggregates its Business Solutions payments foreign currency exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties (economic hedge contracts) as part of a broader foreign currency portfolio, including significant spot exchanges of currency in addition to forwards and options. The changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in "Foreign exchange revenues."

The fair value of the Company's derivatives is derived from standardized models that use market based inputs (e.g., forward prices for foreign currency).



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The details of each designated hedging relationship are formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis.

Legal Contingencies

The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. The Company records an accrual for these contingencies to the extent that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued. When no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, the lowest amount in the range is accrued.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently has a stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of Western Union stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted and unrestricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors of the Company who perform services for the Company. In addition, the Company has a stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of Western Union stock options and stock unit awards to non-employee directors of the Company.

All stock-based compensation to employees is required to be measured at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period and also requires an estimate of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense. The Company recognizes compensation expense on awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Refer to Note 16 for additional discussion regarding details of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.

Severance and Other Related Expenses

The Company records severance-related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of the applicable accounting guidance for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. One-time, involuntary benefit arrangements and other costs are generally recognized when the liability is incurred. The Company also evaluates impairment issues associated with restructuring and other activities when the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance.

New Accounting Pronouncement

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting pronouncement regarding revenue from contracts with customers. This new standard provides guidance on recognizing revenue, including a five step model to determine when revenue recognition is appropriate. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this standard will have on the Company's financial position, results of operations, and related disclosures, and will adopt the provisions of this new standard in the first quarter of 2017.

3.  Productivity and Cost-Savings Initiatives Expenses

During each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, the Company implemented initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. A significant majority of the productivity and cost-savings initiatives costs relate to severance and related expenses, and for the year ended December 31, 2013, these costs also included costs related to termination benefits received by certain of the Company's former executives. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred

5.  Commitments and Contingencies

Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees

The Company had approximately

$210 million

in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of

December 31, 2014

. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements, certain agent agreements, and in relation to an uncertain tax position. The letters of credit and bank guarantees have expiration dates through


, with the majority having a

one

-year renewal option. The Company expects to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances. The bank guarantees related to the uncertain tax position were extinguished in January 2015 after resolution of the related matter.

Litigation and Related Contingencies

The Company is subject to certain claims and litigation that could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be significant, or criminal charges. Substantially all of the Company's contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. The Company does not currently believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable and the Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the periods in which amounts are accrued or paid. The principal pending matters the Company is a party to are discussed below.

State of Arizona Settlement Agreement

On February 11, 2010, Western Union Financial Services, Inc. ("WUFSI"), a subsidiary of the Company, signed a settlement agreement ("Southwest Border Agreement"), which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona (the "State") and required the Company to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. As part of the Southwest Border Agreement, the Company has made and expects to make certain investments in its compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor (the "Monitor") has been engaged for those programs. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the Southwest Border Agreement. The Monitor has made a number of recommendations related to the Company's compliance programs, which the Company is implementing, including programs related to our Business Solutions segment.

On January 31, 2014, the Southwest Border Agreement was amended to extend its term until December 31, 2017 (the "Amendment"). The Amendment imposes additional obligations on the Company and WUFSI in connection with WUFSI’s anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance programs and cooperation with law enforcement. In particular, the Amendment requires WUFSI to continue implementing the primary and secondary recommendations made by the Monitor appointed pursuant to the Southwest Border Agreement related to WUFSI’s AML compliance program, and includes, among other things, timeframes for implementing such primary and secondary recommendations. Under the Amendment, the Monitor could make additional primary recommendations until January 1, 2015 and may make additional secondary recommendations until January 31, 2017. After these dates, the Monitor may only make additional primary or secondary recommendations, as applicable, that meet certain requirements as set forth in the Amendment. Primary recommendations may also be re-classified as secondary recommendations.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Amendment provides that if WUFSI is unable to implement an effective AML compliance program along the U.S. and Mexico border, as determined by the Monitor and subject to limited judicial review, within the timeframes to implement the Monitor’s primary recommendations, the State may, within


days after the Monitor delivers its final report on the primary recommendations on December 31, 2016, and subsequent to any judicial review of the Monitor’s findings, elect

one

, and only one, of the following remedies: (i) assert a willful and material breach of the Southwest Border Agreement and pursue remedies under the Southwest Border Agreement, which could include initiating civil or criminal actions; or (ii) require WUFSI to pay (a)

$50 million

plus (b)

$1 million

per primary recommendation or group of primary recommendations that WUFSI fails to implement successfully. There are currently more than


primary recommendations and groups of primary recommendations.

If the Monitor concludes that WUFSI has implemented an effective AML compliance program along the U.S. and Mexico border within the timeframes to implement the Monitor’s primary recommendations, the State cannot pursue either of the remedies above, except that the State may require WUFSI to pay

$1 million

per primary recommendation or group of primary recommendations that WUFSI fails to implement successfully.

If, at the conclusion of the timeframe to implement the secondary recommendations on December 31, 2017, the Monitor concludes that WUFSI has not implemented an effective AML compliance program along the U.S. and Mexico border, the State cannot assert a willful and material breach of the Southwest Border Agreement but may require WUFSI to pay an additional

$25 million

. Additionally, if the Monitor determines that WUFSI has implemented an effective AML compliance program along the U.S. and Mexico border but has not implemented some of the Monitor’s secondary recommendations or groups of secondary recommendations that were originally classified as primary recommendations or groups of primary recommendations on the date of the Amendment, the State may require WUFSI to pay

$500,000

per such secondary recommendation or group of recommendations. There is no monetary penalty associated with secondary recommendations that are classified as such on the date of the Amendment or any new secondary recommendations that the Monitor makes after the date of the Amendment.

The Amendment requires WUFSI to continue funding the Monitor’s reasonable expenses in

$500,000

increments as requested by the Monitor. The Amendment also requires WUFSI to make a one-time payment of

$250,000

, which was paid in March 2014, and thereafter

$150,000

per month for

five

years to fund the activities and expenses of a money transfer transaction data analysis center formed by WUFSI and a Financial Crimes Task Force comprised of federal, state and local law enforcement representatives, including those from the State. In addition, California, Texas, and New Mexico are also participating in the money transfer transaction data analysis center.

The changes in WUFSI’s AML program required by the Southwest Border Agreement, including the Amendment, and the Monitor’s recommendations have had, and will continue to have, adverse effects on the Company’s business, including additional costs. Additionally, if WUFSI is not able to implement a successful AML compliance program along the U.S. and Mexico border or timely implement the Monitor’s recommendations, each as determined by the Monitor, the State may pursue remedies under the Southwest Border Agreement and Amendment, including assessment of fines and civil and criminal actions. Such fines and actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Shareholder Action and Other Matters

On December 10, 2013, City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System filed a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against The Western Union Company, its President and Chief Executive Officer and a former executive officer of the Company, asserting claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Securities and Exchange Commission rule 10b-5 against all defendants. On September 26, 2014, the Court appointed SEB Asset Management S.A. and SEB Investment Management AB as lead plaintiffs. On October 27, 2014, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint, which asserts the same claims as the original complaint, except that it brings the claims under section 20(a) of the Exchange Act only against the individual defendants. The consolidated amended complaint also adds as a defendant another former executive officer of the Company. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that, during the purported class period, February 7, 2012 through October 30, 2012, defendants made false or misleading statements or failed to disclose adverse material facts known to them, including those regarding: (1) the competitive advantage the Company derived from its compliance program; (2) the Company’s ability to increase market share, make limited price adjustments and withstand competitive pressures; (3) the effect of compliance measures under the Southwest Border Agreement on agent retention and business in Mexico; and (4) the Company’s progress in implementing an anti-money laundering program for the Southwest Border Area. On December 11, 2014, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On January 5, 2015, plaintiffs filed an opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On January 23, 2015, defendants filed a reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. This action is in a preliminary stage and the Company is unable to predict the outcome, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with this action. The Company and the named individuals intend to vigorously defend themselves in this matter.

The Company and one of its subsidiaries are defendants in

two

purported class action lawsuits: James P. Tennille v. The Western Union Company and Robert P. Smet v. The Western Union Company, both of which are pending in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The original complaints asserted claims for violation of various consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, conversion and declaratory relief, based on allegations that the Company waits too long to inform consumers if their money transfers are not redeemed by the recipients and that the Company uses the unredeemed funds to generate income until the funds are escheated to state governments. The Tennille complaint was served on the Company on April 27, 2009. The Smet complaint was served on the Company on April 6, 2010. On September 21, 2009, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss the Tennille complaint and gave the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. On October 21, 2009, Tennille filed an amended complaint. The Company moved to dismiss the Tennille amended complaint and the Smet complaint. On November 8, 2010, the Court denied the motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment and conversion claims. On February 4, 2011, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs' consumer protection claims. On March 11, 2011, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that adds a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, various elements to its declaratory relief claim and WUFSI as a defendant. On April 25, 2011, the Company and WUFSI filed a motion to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty and declaratory relief claims. WUFSI also moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs' claims and to stay the action pending arbitration. On November 21, 2011, the Court denied the motion to compel arbitration and the stay request. Both companies appealed the decision. On January 24, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit granted the companies' request to stay the District Court proceedings pending their appeal. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the parties executed a settlement agreement, which the Court preliminarily approved on January 3, 2013. On June 25, 2013, the Court entered an order certifying the class and granting final approval to the settlement. Under the approved settlement, a substantial amount of the settlement proceeds, as well as all of the class counsel’s fees, administrative fees and other expenses, would be paid from the class members' unclaimed money transfer funds, which are included within "Settlement obligations" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the final approval hearing, the Court overruled objections to the settlement that had been filed by several class members. In July 2013,

two

of those class members filed notices of appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit heard oral arguments on March 18, 2014. The settlement requires Western Union to deposit the class members' unclaimed money transfer funds into a class settlement fund, from which class member claims, administrative fees and class counsel’s fees, as well as other expenses will be paid. On November 6, 2013, the Attorney General of California notified Western Union of the California Controller’s position that Western Union’s deposit of the unclaimed money transfer funds into the class settlement fund pursuant to the settlement “will not satisfy Western Union’s obligations to report and remit funds” under California’s unclaimed property law, and that “Western Union will remain liable to the State of California” for the funds that would have escheated to California in the absence of the settlement. The State of Pennsylvania and District of Columbia have expressed similar views. Thus, there is reason to believe that these and potentially other jurisdictions may bring actions against the Company seeking reimbursement for amounts equal to the class counsel’s fees, administrative costs and other expenses that are paid from the class settlement fund. If such actions are brought or claims that may otherwise require Western Union to incur additional escheatment-related liabilities are asserted, Western Union would defend itself vigorously.

In August 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) served Paymap, Inc. (“Paymap”), a subsidiary of the Company which operates solely in the United States, with a civil investigative demand requesting information and documents about Paymap’s Equity Accelerator service, which is designed to help consumers pay off their mortgages more quickly. The CFPB’s investigation sought to determine whether Paymap’s marketing of the Equity Accelerator service violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (“UDAAP”). The Company cooperated with the investigation. After reviewing information and documents provided by the Company, in August 2014, the CFPB advised the Company of its view that certain aspects of Paymap’s marketing violated UDAAP. The Company has advised the CFPB that it disagrees with the CFPB’s position. The Company is in discussions with the CFPB and is seeking to reach an appropriate resolution of this matter. Due to the early stage of the discussions, the Company is unable to predict whether the CFPB will institute an enforcement action to bring any claims against the Company as a result of the investigation, or the possible range of loss, if any, which could be associated with such an action. Should the CFPB institute an enforcement action against the Company, the Company could face significant restitution payments to certain Equity Accelerator consumers, civil money penalties, or regulatory consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

On March 12, 2014, Jason Douglas filed a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting a claim under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq., based on allegations that since 2009, the Company has sent text messages to class members’ wireless telephones without their consent. The plaintiff has not sought and the Court has not granted class certification. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter. However, due to the preliminary stage of the lawsuit and the uncertainty as to whether it will ever be certified as a class action, the potential outcome cannot be determined.

On January 26, 2006, the First Data Corporation ("First Data") Board of Directors announced its intention to pursue the distribution of all of its money transfer and consumer payments business and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (the “Spin-off”). The Spin-off resulted in the formation of the Company and these assets and businesses no longer being part of First Data. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with First Data in connection with the Spin-off, First Data and the Company are each liable for, and agreed to perform, all liabilities with respect to their respective businesses. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement also provides for cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the Company's business with the Company and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of First Data's retained businesses with First Data. The Company also entered into a tax allocation agreement that sets forth the rights and obligations of First Data and the Company with respect to taxes imposed on their respective businesses both prior to and after the Spin-off as well as potential tax obligations for which the Company may be liable in conjunction with the Spin-off (see Note 10).

6.  Related Party Transactions

The Company has ownership interests in certain of its agents accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company pays these agents, as it does its other agents, commissions for money transfer and other services provided on the Company's behalf. Commission expense recognized for these agents for the years ended

December 31, 2014

Prior to 2014, the Company had a director who was also a director for a company that previously held significant investments in

two

of the Company's existing agents. During the first quarter of 2012, this company sold its interest in one of these agents, so that for the year ended December 31, 2013, this company held a significant investment in only

one

agent. These agents had been agents of the Company prior to the director being appointed to the board. The Company recognized commission expense of

7.  Investment Securities

Investment securities included in "Settlement assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, including fixed rate term notes, variable rate demand notes and a short-term bond mutual fund. The short-term bond mutual fund can be redeemed daily and holds fixed income securities with combined average maturities of one year or less. Variable rate demand note securities can be put (sold at par) typically on a daily basis with settlement periods ranging from the same day to one week, but have varying maturities through


. Generally, these securities are used by the Company for short-term liquidity needs and are held for short periods of time, typically less than

30 days

. The Company is required to hold highly-rated, investment grade securities and such investments are restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable state and foreign country requirements.

In 2013, the Company invested in a short-term taxable bond mutual fund which held a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company sold this investment for

$100.2 million

, which was also the fair value of this investment as of December 31, 2013. The investment was included in "Other assets" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013.

The substantial majority of the Company's investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. Western Union regularly monitors credit risk and attempts to mitigate its exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and through investment diversification.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of related deferred taxes. Proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities during the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


were

$17.7 billion

,

$19.0 billion

and

$16.3 billion

, respectively.

Gains and losses on investments are calculated using the specific-identification method and are recognized during the period in which the investment is sold or when an investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value. Factors that could indicate an impairment exists include, but are not limited to: earnings performance, changes in credit rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or economic environment of the asset. If potential impairment exists, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the debt security, more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or expects that some of the contractual cash flows will not be received. The Company had no material other-than-temporary impairments during the periods presented.

Other Fair Value Measurements

The carrying amounts for many of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, and settlement receivables and settlement obligations approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The aggregate fair value of the Company's borrowings was based on quotes from multiple banks and excluded the impact of related interest rate swaps. All the assets and liabilities in the above tables were carried at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of borrowings, which had a carrying value of

$3,720.4 million

and

$4,213.0 million

as of

December 31, 2014

Accordingly, the percentage obtained by dividing the total federal, state and local tax provision by the domestic pre-tax income, all as shown in the preceding tables, may be higher than the statutory tax rates in the United States.

The Company's effective tax rates differed from statutory rates as follows:



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2014

compared to


is primarily due to the combined effect of various discrete items, including those related to foreign currency fluctuations on certain income tax attributes, and changes in tax contingency reserves, partially offset by changes in the composition of earnings between foreign and domestic. The increase in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2013

compared to


is primarily due to the combined effect of various discrete items, partially offset by an increasing proportion of profits that were foreign-derived in 2013, and generally taxed at lower rates than the Company's combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. The Company continues to benefit from a significant proportion of its profits being foreign-derived, and generally taxed at lower rates than its combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. Certain portions of the Company's foreign source income are subject to United States federal and state income tax as earned due to the nature of the income, and dividend repatriations of the Company's foreign source income are generally subject to United States federal and state income tax.

The Company's provision for income taxes consisted of the following components (in millions):

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities. The following table outlines the principal components of deferred tax items (in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the Company's ability to recognize tax benefits associated with certain foreign net operating losses, certain U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, and certain foreign undistributed earnings. Such uncertainties include generating sufficient income, generating sufficient U.S. foreign tax credit limitation related to passive income, and demonstrating the ability to distribute certain foreign earnings. Changes in circumstances, or the identification and implementation of relevant tax planning strategies, could make it foreseeable that the Company will recover these deferred tax assets in the future, which could lead to a reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction in income tax expense.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company has established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of

December 31, 2014

, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was

$96.8 million

, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. The Company's tax reserves reflect management's judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While the Company believes its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, the Company's income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from the Company's tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact operating cash flows.

Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the amounts otherwise recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements, and are reflected in "Income taxes payable" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):

____________

(a)

Includes recurring accruals for issues which initially arose in previous periods.

(b)

Changes to positions taken in prior periods relate to changes in estimates used to calculate prior period unrecognized tax benefits.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was

$82.4 million

and

$108.9 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, excluding interest and penalties.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits in "Provision for income taxes" in its Consolidated Statements of Income, and records the associated liability in "Income taxes payable" in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized

$1.5 million

,

$(1.8) million

and

$0.5 million

in interest and penalties during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. The Company has accrued

$15.1 million

and

$17.7 million

for the payment of interest and penalties as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The unrecognized tax benefits accrual as of

December 31, 2014

consists of federal, state and foreign tax matters. It is reasonably possible that the Company's total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately

$26 million

during the next 12 months in connection with various matters which may be resolved.

The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns for the United States, for multiple states and localities, and for various non-United States jurisdictions, and the Company has identified the United States as its major tax jurisdiction, as the income tax imposed by any one foreign country is not material to the Company. The United States federal income tax returns of First Data, which include the Company, are eligible to be examined for 2005 and 2006. The Company's United States federal income tax returns since the Spin-off are also eligible to be examined.

The United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed its examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004, which included the Company, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. In December 2011, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the Company's restructuring of its international operations in 2003 ("IRS Agreement"). As a result of the IRS Agreement, the Company expects to make cash payments of approximately

$190 million

, plus additional accrued interest, of which

$94.1 million

has been paid as of

December 31, 2014

. A substantial majority of these payments were made in the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company expects to pay the remaining amount in 2015 and beyond. The IRS completed its examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data, which include the Company's 2005 and pre-Spin-off 2006 taxable periods and issued its report on October 31, 2012 ("FDC 30-Day Letter"). Furthermore, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's United States federal consolidated income tax returns for the 2006 post-Spin-off period through 2009 and issued its report also on October 31, 2012 ("WU 30-Day Letter"). Both the FDC 30-Day Letter and the WU 30-Day Letter propose tax adjustments affecting the Company, some of which are agreed and some of which are unagreed. Both First Data and the Company filed their respective protests with the IRS Appeals Division on November 28, 2012 related to the unagreed proposed adjustments. Discussions with the IRS concerning these adjustments are ongoing. The Company believes its reserves are adequate with respect to both the agreed and unagreed adjustments.

As of

December 31, 2014

,

no

provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes on certain of the Company's outside tax basis differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately

$5.6 billion

, which have been reinvested and are expected to continue to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. Over the last several years, such earnings have been used to pay for the Company's international acquisitions and operations and provide initial Company funding of global principal payouts for Consumer-to-Consumer and Business Solutions transactions. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, the Company would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. Such taxes could be significant. Determination of this amount of unrecognized United States deferred tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Tax Allocation Agreement with First Data

The Company and First Data each are liable for taxes imposed on their respective businesses both prior to and after the Spin-off. If such taxes have not been appropriately apportioned between First Data and the Company, subsequent adjustments may occur that may impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Also under the tax allocation agreement, with respect to taxes and other liabilities that result from a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant tax opinion) ("Spin-off Related Taxes"), the Company will be liable to First Data for any such Spin-off Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by or with respect to the Company. In addition, the Company will also be liable for half of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that would not have been imposed but for the existence of both an action by the Company and an action by First Data or (ii) where the Company and First Data each take actions that, standing alone, would have resulted in the imposition of such Spin-off Related Taxes. The Company may be similarly liable if it breaches certain representations or covenants set forth in the tax allocation agreement. If the Company is required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. First Data generally will be liable for all Spin-off Related Taxes, other than those described above.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Western Union Company Incentive Savings Plan (the "401(k)") covers eligible employees on the United States payroll of the Company. Employees who make voluntary contributions to this plan receive up to a

Company matching contribution. All matching contributions are immediately vested.

The Company administers more than


defined contribution plans in various countries globally on behalf of approximately

In addition, the Company sponsors a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of highly compensated United States employees. The plan provides tax-deferred contributions and the restoration of Company matching contributions otherwise limited under the 401(k).

The rate assumptions used in the measurement of the Company's net cost were as follows:

The Company measures the Plan's obligations and annual expense using assumptions that reflect best estimates and are consistent to the extent that each assumption reflects expectations of future economic conditions. As the bulk of the pension benefits will not be paid for many years, the computation of pension expenses and benefits is based on assumptions about future interest rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. In general, pension obligations are most sensitive to the discount rate assumption, and it is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities.

The estimated undiscounted future benefit payments are expected to be

$36.4 million

in 2015,

$35.0 million

in 2016,

$33.5 million

in 2017,

$32.0 million

in 2019 and

$128.5 million

in 2020 through 2024.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical risk, return, and co-variance relationships between equities, fixed-income securities, and alternative investments are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to diversification, re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical returns are reviewed within the context of current economic conditions to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. The Company then applies this rate against a calculated value for its plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five-year period.

Pension plan asset allocation as of

December 31, 2014

and


, and target allocations based on investment policies, were as follows:

The Plan's assets are managed in a third-party Trust. The investment policy and allocation of the assets in the Trust are overseen by the Company's Investment Council. The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity, fixed income, and alternative investments are used in an effort to improve the long-term risk adjusted return of plan assets. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities and plan funded status. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments (e.g. hedge funds, royalty rights and private equity funds). Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as securities deemed to be growth, value, and small and large capitalizations. Alternative investments, the majority of which are hedge funds, are used in an effort to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to: relative value, equity long-short, commodities/currencies, multi-strategy, event driven, and global-macro. The Plan holds interest rate derivative contracts directly, including interest rate futures that are based on U.S. treasury bond rates ranging from

two

years to

twenty-five

years. The Plan may also hold interest rate swaps, under which the Plan is committed to pay or receive a short-term LIBOR-based variable interest rate in exchange for a fixed interest rate, primarily based on

five

and

ten

-year maturities. Additionally, derivatives are held indirectly through funds in which the Plan is invested. Derivatives are used by the Plan to help reduce the Plan's exposure to interest rate volatility and to provide an additional source of return. Cash held by the Plan is used to satisfy margin requirements on the derivatives or meet liquidity needs, including benefit payments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.

The following tables provide summaries of changes in the fair value of the Trust's Level 3 financial assets (in millions):

Royalty rights are held through investment funds. These investments are priority interests in contractual royalty revenue derived from the sale of pharmaceutical products that entitle the investment fund to receive a portion of revenue from the patent-protected product. The investment funds either acquire royalties directly or invest in debt instruments secured by the cash flow from one or more royalties. The fair value of the direct investments in royalty rights is estimated using consensus Wall Street analysts' sales estimates for the pharmaceutical products, which are multiplied by the contractual royalty rate, and then discounted by an interest rate based off the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the pharmaceutical sector, which is then adjusted for liquidity and diversification considerations. After these adjustments, this discount rate was approximately

10%

as of

December 31, 2014

. Debt instruments secured by royalties are generally valued based on actual product sales versus revenue projections at the time of investment and are subject to impairment testing.

Private equity funds invest in the non-marketable securities of individual private companies. These private companies ultimately may become public in the future. The fair value of the Plan's investment in private equity funds is estimated using many types of inputs, including historical sales multiples, valuations of comparable public companies, and recently completed equity financings.

Unrealized gains and losses on investment securities that are available for sale, primarily state and municipal debt securities, are included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" until the investment is either sold or deemed other-than-temporarily impaired. See Note 7 for further discussion.

The effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss." Generally, amounts are recognized in income when the related forecasted transaction affects earnings. See Note 14 for further discussion.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the United States dollar are translated using the appropriate exchange rate as of the end of the year. Foreign currency translation adjustments represent unrealized gains and losses on assets and liabilities arising from the difference in the foreign country currency compared to the United States dollar. These gains and losses are accumulated in comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is substantially liquidated, the cumulative translation gain or loss is removed from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and is recognized as a component of the gain or loss on the sale of the subsidiary.

The defined benefit pension plan adjustment is recognized for the difference between estimated assumptions (e.g., asset returns, discount rates, mortality) and actual results. The amount in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" is amortized to income over the remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Details of the pension plan's assets and obligations are explained further in Note 11.

14.  Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the euro, and to a lesser degree the Canadian dollar, British pound, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, and other currencies, related to forecasted money transfer revenues and on money transfer settlement assets and obligations. The Company is also exposed to risk from derivative contracts written to its customers arising from its cross-currency Business Solutions payments operations. Additionally, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in market rates both prior to and subsequent to the issuance of debt. The Company uses derivatives to (a) minimize its exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency Business Solutions payments by writing derivatives to customers.

The Company executes derivatives with established financial institutions, with the substantial majority of these financial institutions having credit ratings of "A-" or better from a major credit rating agency. The Company also writes Business Solutions derivatives mostly with small and medium size enterprises. The primary credit risk inherent in derivative agreements represents the possibility that a loss may occur from the nonperformance of a counterparty to the agreements. The Company performs a review of the credit risk of these counterparties at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis. The Company also monitors the concentration of its contracts with any individual counterparty. The Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements, but takes action when doubt arises about the counterparties' ability to perform. These actions may include requiring Business Solutions customers to post or increase collateral, and for all counterparties, the possible termination of the related contracts. The Company's hedged foreign currency exposures are in liquid currencies; consequently, there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the hedging program would not be available in the future.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Currency — Consumer-to-Consumer

The Company's policy is to use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts, with maturities of up to


months at inception and a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year, to mitigate some of the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the United States dollar could have on forecasted revenues denominated in other currencies related to its business. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company's longer-term foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of a maximum of


months with a weighted-average maturity of approximately one year. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenue, with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the spot rate of the affected currencies during the period of designation. Accordingly, all changes in the fair value of the hedges not considered effective or portions of the hedge that are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in "Derivative gains/(losses), net" within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company also uses short duration foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on settlement assets and obligations between initiation and settlement. In addition, forward contracts, typically with maturities of less than one year at inception, are utilized to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash and other asset and liability positions. None of these contracts are designated as accounting hedges.

The aggregate equivalent United States dollar notional amounts of foreign currency forward contracts as of

December 31, 2014

were as follows (in millions):

____________________

(a)

Comprised of exposures to


different currencies. None of these individual currency exposures is greater than

$25 million

.

Foreign Currency — Business Solutions

The Company writes derivatives, primarily foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts, mostly with small and medium size enterprises and derives a currency spread from this activity as part of its Business Solutions operations. The Company aggregates its Business Solutions payments foreign currency exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties (economic hedge contracts). The derivatives written are part of the broader portfolio of foreign currency positions arising from its cross-currency payments operations, which primarily include spot exchanges of currency in addition to forwards and options. The resulting foreign exchange revenues from the total portfolio of positions comprise Business Solutions foreign exchange revenues. None of the derivative contracts used in Business Solutions operations are designated as accounting hedges. The duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The aggregate equivalent United States dollar notional amounts of foreign currency derivative customer contracts held by the Company in its Business Solutions operations as of

December 31, 2014

were approximately

$5.5 billion

. The significant majority of customer contracts are written in major currencies such as the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, and euro.

Interest Rate Hedging — Corporate

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of its notes from fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to manage its overall exposure to interest rates. The Company designates these derivatives as fair value hedges. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps is offset by a change in the carrying value of the debt being hedged within "Borrowings" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and "Interest expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Income has been adjusted to include the effects of interest accrued on the swaps.

The Company, at times, utilizes derivatives to hedge the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the fixed-rate coupon of the debt expected to be issued. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company held interest rate swaps in an aggregate notional amount of

$975.0 million

and

$1,550.0 million

as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively. Of this aggregate notional amount held at December 31, 2014,

$500.0 million

related to notes due in 2017,

$300.0 million

related to notes due in 2018, and

$175.0 million

The following table summarizes the net fair value of derivatives held as of

December 31, 2014

and their expected maturities (in millions):

The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities associated with contracts that include netting language that the Company believes to be enforceable have been netted in the following tables to present the Company's net exposure with these counterparties. The Company's rights under these agreements generally allow for transactions to be settled on a net basis, including upon early termination, which could occur upon the counterparty's default, a change in control, or other conditions.

In addition, certain of the Company's other agreements include netting provisions, the enforceability of which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and depending on the circumstances. Due to the uncertainty related to the enforceability of these provisions, the derivative balances associated with these agreements are included within "Derivatives that are not or may not be subject to master netting arrangement or similar agreement" in the following tables. In certain circumstances, the Company may require its Business Solutions customers to maintain collateral balances which may mitigate the risk associated with potential customer defaults.

$1.65 billion

, including a

$250.0 million

letter of credit sub-facility and a

$150.0 million

The Company is required to maintain compliance with a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. The Revolving Credit Facility supports borrowings under the Company’s

$1.5 billion

commercial paper program.

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of


basis points. A facility fee of


basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of the Company’s credit ratings.

Stock Compensation Plans

The Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2006 LTIP") provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock awards and other equity-based awards to employees and others who perform services for the Company. A maximum of

120.0 million

shares of common stock may be awarded under the 2006 LTIP, of which

37.5 million

shares are available as of

December 31, 2014

.

Options granted under the 2006 LTIP are issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of Western Union common stock on the grant date, have


-year terms, and typically vest over

four

equal annual increments beginning 12 months after the date of grant, with the exception of options granted to retirement eligible employees, which generally will vest on a prorated basis, upon termination. Compensation expense related to stock options is recognized over the requisite service period, which is the same as the vesting period.

Restricted stock units under the 2006 LTIP that were granted in 2014 typically vest over four equal annual increments beginning 12 months after the date of grant and restricted stock units granted prior to 2014 typically become

100%

vested on the

three

year anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock units granted to retirement eligible employees generally vest on a prorated basis upon termination. The fair value of the awards granted is measured based on the fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents. For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments. The related compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is the same as the vesting period.

The compensation committee of the Company's Board of Directors has granted the Company's executives and other certain key employees long-term incentive awards under the 2006 LTIP, which in 2014 consisted of

80%

performance-based restricted stock unit awards and

20%

stock option awards and in 2013 consisted of approximately two-thirds performance-based restricted stock unit awards and approximately one-third stock option awards. The compensation committee granted the remaining non-executive employees of the Company participating in the 2006 LTIP (other than those non-executive employees receiving the performance-based restricted stock units described above) annual equity grants consisting solely of restricted stock units for 2014 and in 2013 consisting of two-thirds restricted stock units and one-third stock option awards, or all restricted stock units depending on their employment grade level.

The performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2014 are restricted stock units, primarily granted to the Company's executives and consist of two separate awards. The first award consists of performance-based restricted stock units, which require the Company to meet certain financial objectives during 2014, 2015 and 2016. The second award consists of performance-based restricted stock units with a market condition tied to the Company's total shareholder return in relation to the S&P 500 index as calculated over a three-year performance period (2014 through 2016). The actual number of performance-based restricted stock units that the recipients will receive for the 2014 awards will range from

0%

up to

150%

of the target number of stock units granted based on actual financial and total shareholder return performance results. The performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2013, primarily granted to the Company's executives, are restricted stock units with both performance and market conditions, which require certain financial objectives to be met during 2013 and 2014 plus an additional vesting period and are subject to a payout modifier based on the Company's relative total shareholder return in relation to the S&P 500 index as calculated over a three year performance period (2013 through 2015). The grant date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units is fixed and the amount of restricted stock units released depends upon certain financial and/or total shareholder return performance objectives being met over the performance period. The fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units tied solely to performance conditions is measured similar to the restricted stock units discussed above, while the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units that are tied to a market condition are determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. Unlike the performance-based awards tied solely to performance conditions, compensation costs related to awards with market conditions are recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service period has been completed.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In 2012, the Company started granting bonus stock units out of the 2006 LTIP to the non-employee directors of the Company. Since bonus stock units vest immediately, compensation expense is recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of the awards when granted. These awards may be settled immediately unless the participant elects to defer the receipt of common shares under the applicable plan rules. Prior to making equity grants to non-employee directors out of the 2006 LTIP, the Company granted non-employee directors of the Company options and unrestricted stock units out of the 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan, which was fully utilized in 2013.

and


(in millions, except per share data).

As of

December 31, 2014

, there was

$8.2 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of assumed forfeitures, related to non-vested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.1

years, and there was

$45.7 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of assumed forfeitures, related to non-vested restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.3

years.

Fair Value Assumptions

The Company used the following assumptions for the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the value of Western Union options granted.

Risk-free interest rate

- The risk-free rate for stock options granted during the period is determined by using a United States Treasury rate for the period that coincided with the expected terms listed above.

Expected dividend yield

- The Company's expected annual dividend yield is the calculation of the annualized Western Union dividend divided by an average Western Union stock price on each respective grant date.

Expected volatility

- For the Company's executives and non-employee directors, the expected volatility for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 grants was

33.8%

,

35.3%

and

33.2%

, respectively. The expected volatility for the Company's non-executive employees was

35.2%

and

33.2%

for the 2013 and 2012 grants, respectively. There were no options granted to non-executive employees in 2014. The Company used a blend of implied and historical volatility. The Company's implied volatility was calculated using the market price of traded options on Western Union's common stock and the historical volatility of Western Union stock data.

Expected term

- For 2014, 2013 and 2012, Western Union's expected term for all employees was approximately 6 years. The Company's expected term of options was based upon, among other things, historical exercises, the vesting term of the Company's options and the options' contractual term of ten years.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company's historical experience and future expectations. The calculated fair value is recognized as compensation cost in the Company's consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the entire award. Compensation cost is recognized only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant and evaluated and adjusted periodically to reflect the Company's historical experience and future expectations. Any change in the forfeiture assumption is accounted for as a change in estimate, with the cumulative effect of the change on periods previously reported being reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the period in which the change is made. In the future, as more historical data is available to calculate the volatility of Western Union stock and the actual terms Western Union employees hold options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could change the grant-date fair value of future stock option awards and, ultimately, the recorded compensation expense.

17.  Segments

As previously described in Note 1, the Company classifies its businesses into

three

segments: Consumer-to-Consumer, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") in deciding where to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

The Consumer-to-Consumer operating segment facilitates money transfers between two consumers. The Company's money transfer service is viewed by the Company as one interconnected global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, around the world. The segment includes

five

geographic regions whose functions are limited to generating, managing and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities and also includes the Company's online money transfer service conducted through Western Union branded websites ("westernunion.com"). By means of common processes and systems, these regions and westernunion.com create an interconnected network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one global Consumer-to-Consumer money transfer business and one operating segment.

The Consumer-to-Business operating segment facilitates bill payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses.

The Business Solutions operating segment facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations and individuals.

All businesses that have not been classified in the above segments are reported as "Other" and include the Company's money order and other services.

The Company's reportable segments are reviewed separately below because each reportable segment represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets. The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, the Company's CODM are computed in accordance with the following principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments' revenue compared to total revenue.

•

Costs incurred for the review and closing of acquisitions are included in "Other."

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments.

and

$42.8 million

, respectively, of integration expenses related to the acquisition of Travelex Global Business Payments ("TGBP"), which was acquired in November 2011. TGBP integration expense consists primarily of severance and other benefits, retention, direct and incremental expense consisting of facility relocation, consolidation and closures; IT systems integration; amortization of a transitional trademark license; and other expenses such as training, travel and professional fees. Integration expense does not include costs related to the completion of the TGBP acquisition, which are included in Other.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Information concerning principal geographic areas was as follows (in millions):

The Consumer-to-Consumer geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, the Company splits the revenue between the

two

regions, with each region receiving

50%

. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region,

100%

of the revenue is attributed to that region. The geographic split of revenue above for the Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions segments is based upon the country where the transaction is initiated with

100%

of the revenue allocated to that country. Long-lived assets, consisting of "Property and equipment, net," are presented based upon the location of the assets.

Based on the method used to attribute revenue between countries described in the paragraph above, each individual country outside the United States accounted for less than 10% of consolidated revenue for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. In addition, each individual agent, Consumer-to-Business, or Business Solutions customer accounted for less than 10% of consolidated revenue during these periods.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE REGISTRANT

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Basis of Presentation

The Western Union Company (the "Parent") is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. Under a parent company only presentation, the Parent's investments in its consolidated subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting, and the condensed financial statements do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with The Western Union Company's consolidated financial statements.

2.  Restricted Net Assets

Certain assets of the Parent's subsidiaries totaling approximately

$300 million

constitute restricted net assets, as there are legal or regulatory limitations on transferring such assets outside of the countries where the respective assets are located. Additionally, certain of the Parent's subsidiaries must meet minimum capital requirements in some countries in order to maintain operating licenses.

3.  Related Party Transactions

On October 1, 2012, the Parent issued a promissory note payable to its 100% owned subsidiary First Financial Management Corporation in the amount of

$268.2 million

in exchange for funds distributed to the Parent. The promissory note is due on

June 30, 2015

, bears interest at the fixed rate of

0.23%

per annum, and may be repaid at any time without penalty. The promissory note is included within "Payable to subsidiaries, net" in the Condensed Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2014

and


.

On June 1, 2014, the Parent issued a promissory note payable to its 100% owned subsidiary First Financial Management Corporation in the amount of

$65.0 million

in exchange for funds distributed to the Parent. The promissory note is due on

February 28, 2017

, bears interest at the fixed rate of

0.33%

per annum, and may be repaid at any time without penalty. The promissory note is included within "Payable to subsidiaries, net" in the Condensed Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2014

.

On August 2, 2014, the Parent entered into a credit agreement (the "Facility") with its 100% owned subsidiary Custom House Holdings (USA), Ltd., which expires August 2, 2034, providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of

$700.0 million

. As of

December 31, 2014

,

$506.3 million

of borrowings were outstanding under the Facility. The interest rate applicable for outstanding borrowings under the Facility is the six-month LIBOR rate set on the first day of the calendar year, which was

0.35%

for the year ended

. The Parent's subsidiaries also periodically distribute excess cash balances to the Parent in the form of a dividend, although the amounts of such dividends may vary from year to year.

The Parent files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, and also a number of consolidated state income tax returns on behalf of its subsidiaries. In these circumstances, the Parent is responsible for remitting income tax payments on behalf of the consolidated group. The Parent's provision for income taxes has been computed as if it were a separate tax-paying entity.

4.  Commitments and Contingencies

The Parent had

$3.5 million

in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of
