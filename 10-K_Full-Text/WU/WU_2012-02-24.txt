ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

Overview

The Western Union Company (the “Company,” “Western Union,” “we,” “our” or
“us”) is a leader in global money movement and payment services, providing people and businesses with fast, reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments around the world. The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data Corporation (“First Data”) on February 17, 2006, and on September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western
Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously owned subsidiary.

The Western Union

®

brand is globally recognized and represents speed, reliability, trust and convenience. As people move and travel around the world, they are able to use the services
of a well recognized brand to transfer funds. Our consumer-to-consumer money transfer service enables people to send money around the world in minutes. As of December 31, 2011, our services were available through a global network of more than
485,000 agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories, with approximately 90% of those locations outside of the United States. Each location in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services, with the majority
offering a Western Union branded service. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 70% of our locations had experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months.

We also provide consumers and businesses with flexible and convenient options for making one-time or recurring bill
payments, including business-to-business payment transactions, which are primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, in our global business payments segment. In November 2011, we acquired the business-to-business payment business of
Travelex Holdings Limited, known as Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”). Although the majority of the revenue in our global business payments segment was generated in the United States, international expansion and other key
strategic initiatives, including TGBP, have resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment.

We believe that brand strength, size and reach of our global network, and convenience and reliability for our customers have been important to the growth of our business. As we continue to meet the needs
of our customers for fast, reliable and convenient global money movement and payment services, we are also working to enhance our services and provide our consumer and business clients with access to an expanding portfolio of payment and other
financial services.

The majority of our revenue comes from fees that consumers pay when they send money or
make payments. In certain money transfer and payment services transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer or business and the rate at
which we or our agents are able to acquire the currency.

Our Segments

We manage our business based on the customers we serve and the type of services we offer. Each segment addresses a
different combination of customer needs, distribution networks and services. Our segments are consumer-to-consumer and global business payments. Our other businesses not included in these segments primarily consist of money order and prepaid
services available through a network of third-party agents.



The table below presents the components of our consolidated revenue:

(a)

The consumer-to-consumer geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money
transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue is attributed
to that region.

(b)

Represents the Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia region of our consumer-to-consumer segment, including India.

(c)

Represents the Americas region of our consumer-to-consumer segment, which includes North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America.

(d)

Represents the Asia Pacific region of our consumer-to-consumer segment.

Financial information relating to our international and domestic revenues and long-lived assets for all of our segments
is set forth in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

For
additional details regarding our consumer-to-consumer and global business payments segments, including financial information regarding our international and United States operations, see Item 7 of Part II and our consolidated financial
statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

See
Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to our foreign operations.

Consumer-to-Consumer Segment

Individual money transfers from one consumer to another are the core of our business, representing 84% of our total
consolidated revenues for 2011. We offer consumers a variety of ways to send money. Although most remittances are sent from one of our more than 485,000 agent locations worldwide, in some countries we offer the ability to send money over the
Internet or phone using a credit or debit card, or through a withdrawal directly from a consumer’s bank account or mobile wallet. All agent locations accept cash to initiate a transaction, and some also accept debit cards. We offer consumers
several options to receive a money transfer. While the vast majority of transfers are paid in cash at agent locations, in some places we offer payout directly to the receiver’s bank account, to a stored-value card, to a mobile phone or through
the issuance of a money order.

Operations

Our revenue is derived primarily from transaction fees charged to consumers to transfer money. In money transfers involving different send and receive currencies, we also generate revenue based on the
difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency.



In a typical money transfer transaction, a consumer goes to one of our agent
locations, completes a form specifying, among other things, the name and address of the recipient, and delivers it, along with the principal amount of the money transfer and the fee, to the agent. Certain of these processes are streamlined for our
customers who use our loyalty card. This sending agent enters the transaction information into our money transfer system and the funds are made available for payment, usually within minutes. The recipient enters an agent location in the designated
receiving area or country, presents identification and is paid the transferred amount. Recipients do not pay a fee (although in limited circumstances, a tax may be imposed by the local government on the receipt of the money transfer). We determine
the fee paid by the sender, which generally is based on the principal amount of the transaction and the send and receive locations.

We generally pay our agents a commission based on a percentage of revenue. A commission is usually paid to both the agent that initiated the transaction, the “send agent,” and the agent that
paid the transaction, the “receive agent.” For most agents, the costs of providing the physical infrastructure and staff are typically covered by the agent’s primary business (e.g., postal services, banking, check cashing, travel and
retail businesses), making the economics of being a Western Union agent attractive. Western Union’s global reach and large consumer base allow us to attract agents we believe to be of high quality.

To complement the convenience offered by our network’s global physical locations, in certain countries we have also
made our services available through other channels, as described below under “Services.”

Over 85%
of our consumer-to-consumer transactions involve at least one non-United States location. No individual country outside the United States accounted for more than approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Certain of our agents facilitate a large number of transactions; however, each individual agent accounted for less than 10% of the segment’s revenue during these periods.

Services

We offer money transfer services worldwide. In 2011, the substantial majority of our consumer-to-consumer transactions
were cash money transfers involving our walk-in agent locations around the world. Although demand for in-person, cash money transfers has historically been the strongest, we offer a number of options for sending and receiving funds that provide
consumers convenience and choice. The different ways consumers can send or receive money include the following:

Walk-in money transfer service.

The substantial majority of our remittances constitute transactions in which cash is collected by the agent and payment (usually cash) is available for pick-up
at another agent location in the designated receive location, usually within minutes. We also offer convenience to our consumers to initiate a transaction through the phone using a debit or credit card. To facilitate offering our services at retail
locations that do not have dedicated service staff, we provide “goCASH

sm

” in the United States and the United Kingdom, a money transfer service that lets consumers purchase money transfers at pre-set amounts in-lane, at a cash register, and then complete the transfer
over the phone through a Western Union customer service representative or through our website. We provide a “Cash to Card” service that provides consumers an option to direct funds to a Western Union branded stored-value card in the United
States, with the option to have the card delivered overnight to a consumer’s home.

Our “Next
Day” delivery option is a money transfer that is available for payment the morning after the money transfer is sent. This option is available for certain domestic service within the United States, and in select United States outbound and
international corridors. The Next Day delivery service gives our consumers a lower-priced option for money transfers that do not need to be received within minutes, while still offering the convenience, reliability and ease-of-use that our consumers
expect.



Online money transfer service.

Our websites allow consumers to
send funds online, generally using a credit or debit card, for pay-out at most Western Union branded agent locations around the world. As of December 31, 2011, we are now providing online money transfer service in more than 20 countries,
allowing consumers in these countries to send money throughout the world.

Account based money transfer
service.

This service allows consumers to access Western Union services electronically, directly from their bank’s Internet or automated teller machine (“ATM”) banking service. Consumers can use their bank account to initiate
a Western Union money transfer electronically, without having to visit a physical Western Union agent location. In the United States, including some United States outbound corridors, Canada and in other select international corridors, we provide a
“Direct to Bank” service, enabling a consumer to send a transaction from an agent location directly to a bank account. Globally, we have relationships with over 80 banks that have agreed to offer one or more of these services, primarily
through their online banking portals.

Mobile money transfer service.

Our mobile money transfer
service provides consumers in certain countries with the ability to transfer money to a mobile wallet or bank account. Consumers in selected countries can also initiate transactions from their mobile phones and send money from mobile wallets or bank
accounts. As of December 31, 2011, there were over 150,000 Western Union agent locations enabled with the technology to transfer money to a mobile phone.

Money transfer services through electronic channels, which include online, account based, and mobile money transfer,
combined were 3% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Distribution and Marketing Channels

We offer our consumer-to-consumer service to millions of consumers around the world primarily through our global network
of third-party agents in almost every country and territory, with approximately 90% of our agent locations being located outside of the United States. Our agents facilitate the global distribution and convenience associated with our Western Union
and other brands, which in-turn helps create demand for our services and helps us to recruit and retain agents. Western Union agents include large networks such as post offices, banks and retailers and other established organizations that provide
other consumer products and services. Many of our agents have multiple locations. Our agents know the markets they serve and work with our management to develop business plans for their markets. Many of our agents contribute financial resources to,
or otherwise support, our efforts to market the business. Many agents operate in locations that are open outside of traditional banking hours, for example on nights and weekends. Our top 40 agents globally have been with us an average of
approximately 16 years and in 2011, these long-standing agents were involved in transactions that generated approximately 60% of our consumer-to-consumer revenue.

We provide our third-party agents with our multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems used to originate
and pay money transfers. We continue to develop our network around the world to optimize send and receive corridors. Our systems and processes enable our agents to pay money transfers in more than 120 currencies worldwide. Certain of our agents can
pay in multiple currencies at a single location. Our agents provide the physical infrastructure and staff required to complete the transfers. Western Union provides central operating functions such as transaction processing, settlement, marketing
support and customer relationship management to our agents.

Some of our agents outside the United States
manage subagents. We refer to these agents as superagents. Although our subagents are under contract with these superagents (and not with Western Union directly), the subagent locations typically have access to similar technology and services as our
other agent locations.

Our international agents often customize services as appropriate for their geographic
markets. In some markets, individual agents are independently offering specific services such as stored-value card payout options



or Direct to Bank service. We market our services to consumers in a number of ways, directly and indirectly through our agent partners, leveraging advertising promotional activities, grassroots,
digital, and loyalty programs. Our marketing benefits from feedback from our agents and consumers.

Our
marketing strategy includes our global loyalty card program, which is available in a growing number of countries and territories. As of December 31, 2011, the loyalty card program was available in approximately 80 countries and territories and
had almost 18 million active cards, an increase of 2 million cards from December 31, 2010. The card offers customers faster service at the point-of-sale and, in certain countries and at westernunion.com, reduced transaction fees or
cash back. Loyalty card customers generally initiate more transactions and have a higher rate of retention than non-carded customers. Over 40% of Western Union branded consumer-to-consumer transactions are initiated using a loyalty card. The global
loyalty card program is one component of our customer relationship management strategy designed to support and enhance long-term relationships with our customers. Customer databases supplement these efforts by providing insight on customer
preferences so that we can selectively target customer communications and marketing.

Industry Trends

Over the last several years, except for 2009, the cross-border money transfer industry has experienced growth. Trends in
the cross-border money transfer business tend to correlate to migration trends, global economic opportunity and related employment levels worldwide. The top four inbound remittance countries in the world are India, China, Mexico and the Philippines,
and cumulatively receive an estimated $130 billion annually according to Aite Group LLC’s (“Aite”) July 2011 report. Due to the challenging global economy, including low consumer confidence and high unemployment, the demand for
money transfers has softened compared to historical growth rates. Aite projects cross-border remittance growth of approximately 5% in 2012.

Another significant trend impacting the money transfer industry is the increase in regulation. Regulation in the United States and elsewhere focuses, in part, on anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist
activities and consumer protection. Regulations require money transfer providers, banks and other financial institutions to develop systems to prevent, detect, monitor and report certain transactions.

Competition

We face robust competition in the highly-fragmented consumer-to-consumer money transfer industry. We compete with a variety of remittance providers, including:

•

Global money transfer providers

—Global money transfer providers allow consumers to send money to a wide variety of locations, in both
their home countries and abroad.

•

Regional money transfer providers

—Regional money transfer providers, or “niche” players, provide the same services as global
money transfer providers, but focus on a smaller group of corridors or services within one region, such as North America to the Caribbean, Central or South America, or Western Europe to North Africa.

•

Banks and postbanks

—Banks and postbanks of all sizes compete with us in a number of ways, including bank wire services and card-based
services.

•

Informal networks

—Informal networks enable people to transfer funds without formal mechanisms and often without compliance with
government reporting requirements. We believe that such networks comprise a significant share of the market.

•

Electronic commerce

—Online money transfer services allow consumers to send and receive money electronically using the Internet.



•

Alternative channels

—Alternative channels for sending and receiving money include mail and commercial courier services, money transfers
using mobile phones, and card-based options, such as ATM cards and stored-value cards.

We
believe the most significant competitive factors in consumer-to-consumer remittances relate to brand recognition, trust and reliability, distribution network and channel options, and consumer experience and price.

Global Business Payments Segment

In our global business payments segment, we provide fast and convenient options to make one-time or recurring payments for consumers or businesses to other businesses. We allow consumers to make payments
to a variety of organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, governmental agencies and other businesses. We also provide business-to-business payment services, primarily for
cross-border, cross-currency transactions. We can process payments using the customer’s credit card, debit card, bank account or cash depending on the service selected. We believe our business customers who receive payments through our services
benefit from their relationship with Western Union as it provides them with real-time or near real-time posting of their customer payments. In certain circumstances, our relationships with business customers also provide them with an additional
source of income, as well as reduced expenses for cash and check handling.

Operations

Our revenue in this segment is derived primarily from transaction fees paid by the customer. The
consumer payments fees are typically less than the fees charged in our consumer-to-consumer segment. Consumers may make a cash payment at an agent or owned location and businesses may remit a check, electronic or wire transfer in order to initiate a
transaction. In order to make an electronic payment, consumers or businesses initiate a transaction over the phone or the Internet which we process through credit card, debit card, automated clearing house (“ACH”) or wire transfer,
depending on the service selected. Our Internet services are provided through our own websites or, in certain circumstances, in partnership with other websites for which we act as the service provider. In cross-border transactions involving
different currencies, we primarily generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the business or consumer and the rate at which we are able to acquire currency. In addition, we generate revenue from upfront
enrollment fees received for our Equity Accelerator

®

service, and we earn investment income on funds received
from services sold in advance of settlement with payment recipients.

While we continue to pursue further
international expansion of our offerings in this segment, the majority of the segment’s revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented. However, international expansion, including the TGBP acquisition, and other key
strategic initiatives have resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment.

Services

Our global business payments services are available through a variety of products which give customers choices as to the
payment channel and method of payment, and include the following:

Western Union Business Solutions
(“Business Solutions”).

Business Solutions offers business-to-business payment solutions, primarily for cross-border, cross-currency transactions. This business also includes TGBP. These payment transactions are conducted through
various channels including the phone and Internet. Business Solutions serves as the service provider for other partner websites and also operates its own website. Payments are made predominately through wire transfers and ACH, but in some
situations, checks are remitted. The majority of Business Solutions’ business relates to exchanges of currency at the spot rate which enables customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, in certain countries, we write foreign
currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments.



Western Union Payments.

The Western Union
Payments service, formerly Quick Collect

®

, allows consumers to send funds to businesses and government agencies
across the United States and Canada, using cash and, in certain locations, a debit card. This service is offered primarily at Western Union agent locations, but may be provided via our westernunion.com website in limited situations. This service is
also offered in select international locations under the service mark Quick Pay

SM

. We also offer Quick Cash

®

, a cash disbursement service used by
businesses and government agencies to send money to employees or individuals with whom they have accounts or other business relationships. Similar to our Western Union Payments service, consumers use our Western Union Convenience Pay

®

(“Convenience Pay”) service to send payments by cash or check from a smaller number of Convenience Pay
agent locations primarily to utilities and telecommunication providers. We are in the process of consolidating all of these services to be marketed as Western Union Payments.

Pago Fácil

®

. In South America, we offer walk-in, cash bill payment services which allow consumers to make payments for services such as phone, utilities and other recurring
bills. In Argentina, we provide this service under the Pago Fácil brand. We offer this service under the Western Union brand in Peru and Panama.

Speedpay

®

. Our Speedpay service is offered principally in the United States and allows consumers to make payments to a variety of businesses using credit cards, debit
cards, ACH and in limited situations, checks. Payments are initiated over the phone or the Internet. We also partner with some businesses to allow their customers to access Speedpay from their websites.

Equity Accelerator.

Our Equity Accelerator service enables consumers to make mortgage
payments by ACH. It is marketed as a convenient way for homeowners to schedule additional recurring principal payments on their mortgages. Consumers who enroll in this service make mortgage payments based on an accelerated program, which results in
a more rapid reduction of their mortgage balance, as well as interest savings. We also offer a non-recurring mortgage payment service under the brand Just in Time EFT

®

.

Distribution and Marketing Channels

Our electronic consumer payment services are available primarily through the phone and the Internet, while our cash-based
consumer services are available through our agent networks and select Company owned locations. Our business payment services are offered through Company locations, phone, via the Internet and partner channels.

Businesses market our services to consumers in a number of ways, and we market our services directly to consumers and
businesses using a variety of means, including advertising materials, promotional activities, call campaigns and attendance at trade shows and seminars. Our Internet services are marketed to consumers and businesses on our websites as well as
through co-branding arrangements with our website partners who offer our payment solutions.

We have
relationships with more than 10,000 consumer payments businesses to which our customers can make payments. These relationships are a core component of our global business payments services. On average, we have provided our payment services to our
top 20 businesses to which our consumers can make payments for more than 14 years. No individual customer or business accounted for greater than 10% of this segment’s revenue during all periods presented.

Industry Trends

The global business payments industry has evolved with technological innovations that have created new methods of processing payments from individuals or businesses to other businesses. The various
products within the global business payments industry are in varying stages of development outside the United States. The cross-border payments industry is expected to expand considerably in the future due to the expanding global focus of many
businesses. We believe that the United States is in the midst of a trend away from cash and paper checks toward electronic payment methods accessible through multiple technologies.



Competition

Western Union competes with a diverse set of service providers offering both cash and electronic-based payment solutions and business-to-business payment services. Competition in electronic payments and
business-to-business payment services include financial institutions (which may offer consumer bill payment or business payment services in their own name or may “host” payment services operated under the names of their clients) and other
non-bank competitors. Competition for electronic payments also includes businesses offering their own or third-party services to their own customers and third-party providers of all sizes offering services directly to consumers. In many cases,
competitors specialize in a small number of industries. Competitors for cash payments include businesses that allow consumers to pay a bill at one of their locations, or at the location of a partner business, as well as mail and courier services.
The ongoing trend away from cash-based bill payments in the United States and competitive pressures, which result in lower cash-based bill payment volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products, continue to impact this business.

We believe the most significant competitive factors in this segment relate to brand recognition, customer
service, trust and reliability, convenience, speed, variety of payment methods, service offerings and price.

For additional details regarding our global business payments segment, see Item 7 of Part II and our historical
financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

for making purchases, paying bills, and as an alternative to checks that can be deposited directly into bank accounts or cashed at check cashiers, some banks and some retailers. We derive investment income from interest generated on our money order
settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities.

Our prepaid cards are sold primarily in the United States through retail locations and on the Internet. This service
allows consumers to load money or receive a direct deposit onto the card for use at a later date. The card can be used to withdraw money from an ATM or used where debit cards are accepted. We have agreements with depository institutions insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that serve as the issuers of our cards in the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we began offering certain of our prepaid cards in the United Kingdom and began testing in certain European
countries.

Intellectual Property

The Western Union brand, including trademark registrations in many countries, is material to our
Company. The international expansion of our agent network over the past decade has taken the Western Union brand nearly everywhere consumers send and receive money. The loss of the Western Union trademark or a diminution in the perceived quality
associated with the name would harm our growth. We offer money transfer services under the Western Union, Orlandi
Valuta

SM

or Vigo

®

brands in more than 200 countries and territories, and various global business payment services under several brands
like Speedpay, Equity Accelerator, Just in Time EFT, Paymap

®

, Western Union Payments, Quick Collect, Convenience
Pay, Quick Pay, Quick Cash, Pago Fácil (registered in Argentina), Western Union Business Solutions and other trademarks and service marks, such as MoneyWise

TM

, that are also important to our Company.

Our operating results over the past several years have allowed us to invest significantly each year to support our
brands. In 2011, we invested approximately $225 million to market, advertise and promote our brands and services, including costs of dedicated marketing personnel. Many of our agents have also contributed significant financial resources to
assist with marketing our services.



We own patents and patent applications covering various aspects of our
processes and services. We have been, are and in the future may be, subject to claims and suits alleging that our technology or business methods infringe patents owned by others, both in and out of the United States. Unfavorable resolution of these
claims could require us to change how we deliver services, result in significant financial consequences, or both, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risk Management

Our Company has a credit risk management department that evaluates and monitors our agent-related credit and fraud risks. We are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the
money transfer, walk-in bill payment and money order settlement process. We also are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our online services and electronic global business payment channels, where
transactions are originated through means other than cash, and may therefore be subject to “chargebacks,” insufficient funds, or other collection impediments, such as fraud. Our credit risk management team performs a credit review before
each agent signing and conducts periodic analyses. As a result, our losses associated with bad debts have been less than 1% of our annual revenue in each of the last three fiscal years.

We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our
customers and (b) receivables from certain customers for which beneficiaries are paid prior to receiving cleared funds from the customer (known as “early release”). For the derivatives, the duration of these contracts is generally
nine months or less. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to
maintain appropriate collateral with us. For early release customers, collection ordinarily occurs within a few days. To mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis, and, for our derivatives, we may require certain
customers to post collateral or increase collateral based on the fair value of the customer’s contract and their risk profile.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market fund investments and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial
institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions.

A key component of the Western Union business model is our ability to manage financial risk associated with conducting
transactions worldwide. We settle accounts with the majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. We utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, primarily forward contracts, to mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations
and to provide predictability of future cash flows. Limited foreign currency risk arises with respect to the agent settlement process because the majority of money transfer transactions are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated and
agent settlements occur within a few days in most instances.

Our financial results may fluctuate due to
changes in interest rates. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, while also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus
floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest-bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt.
The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt,
subject to market conditions.

International Investment

No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes on certain of our outside tax basis
differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2011, as we expect to reinvest these earnings outside the United States indefinitely. We intend to



invest these earnings to expand and diversify our global distribution and explore new service offerings and may also consider international acquisition opportunities. In 2011, our foreign cash
allowed us to acquire TGBP and the remaining interests in two of our largest European-based agents, Finint S.r.l. (“Finint”) and Angelo Costa, S.r.l. (“Costa”). However, if we are unable to utilize accumulated earnings outside of
the United States and we repatriate these earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to United States federal income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes
and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. Such taxes could be significant.

Regulation

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by the United States federal government, each of
the states, many localities and many other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union. These include financial services regulations, consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, money transfer and
payment instrument licensing regulations, payment service laws, rules, laws and regulations including those governing credit and debit cards, electronic payments, foreign exchange hedging services and the sale of spot, forward and option currency
contracts, unclaimed property laws, competition laws and laws covering consumer privacy, data protection and information security. Our services also are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help
detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activity. Failure to comply with any of these requirements—by either Western Union or its agents or their subagents (who are third parties, over whom Western Union has
limited legal and practical control)—could result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration required to provide money transfer services and/or payment services or foreign exchange products, the limitation, suspension or
termination of services, the seizure of our assets, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines and restrictions on our ability to offer services.

We have developed and continue to enhance our global compliance programs, including our anti-money laundering program,
which comprises policies, procedures, systems and internal controls to monitor and to address various legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, we continue to adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current and
evolving legal standards and industry practices. These programs include dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring programs, suspicious activity reporting, regulatory outreach and education, and support and guidance to our agent network
on regulatory compliance. Our money transfer network operates through third-party agents in most countries, and, therefore, there are limitations on our legal and practical ability to completely control those agents’ compliance activities.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”) became United States federal law in
2010. The Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) whose purpose is to issue and enforce consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money transfer services. The CFPB will
create additional regulatory oversight for us. Recent remittance regulations issued by the CFPB, which become effective in February 2013, will impact our business in a variety of areas. These include a requirement to provide enhanced pre-transaction
disclosures, an obligation to resolve various errors, including certain errors that may be outside the remittance provider’s control, and an obligation to cancel transactions at a consumer’s request. We will need to modify certain of our
systems, business practices, service offerings or procedures at agent locations. We will also become liable for the failure of our money transfer agents to comply with the rules and will need to establish and implement additional policies,
procedures, and oversight measures designed to assure compliance by our agents. The extent of these policies, procedures, and measures may be considered by the CFPB in any action or proceeding against us for noncompliance with the rules by our
agents. We may also be subject to examination by the CFPB. In addition, rules adopted under the Act by other governmental agencies may subject our corporate interest rate and foreign exchange hedging transactions to centralized clearing, centralized
trading, collateral posting and other requirements. Also, our Business Solutions business in the United States may be subjected to increased regulatory oversight and licensing requirements relating to the foreign exchange derivative products offered
to certain of its customers.



Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing and Regulation

In the United States, most states license money transfer services providers and many exercise authority over the
operations of our money transfer services and, as part of this authority, regularly examine us. Many states require us to invest the proceeds of money transfers in highly-rated, investment grade securities, and our use of such investments is
restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities in compliance with these regulations. The majority of our investment securities,
classified within “Settlement assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are held to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and had credit ratings of “AA–” or better from a major credit rating agency
as of December 31, 2011.

These licensing laws also cover matters such as government approval of
controlling shareholders and senior management of our licensed entities, regulatory approval of agents and in some instances their locations, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee, and require the licensee to
demonstrate and maintain certain net worth levels. Many states also require money transmitters and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations.

Our money transfer and money order services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank
Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the “BSA”) and similar state laws and regulations. The BSA, among other things, requires money transfer companies and the issuers and sellers of money orders, to develop
and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and in some cases, to collect and maintain information about consumers who use their services and maintain other transaction records.
Many states impose similar and, in some cases, more stringent requirements. These requirements also apply to our agents. In addition, the United States Department of the Treasury has interpreted the BSA to require money transfer companies to conduct
due diligence into and risk-based monitoring of their agents inside and outside the United States.

Economic
and trade sanctions programs administered by the United States Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or dealings with) certain countries, their governments, and
in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with specifically-designated individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists and terrorist organizations. We provide very limited consumer-to-consumer services to individuals
in Cuba, Syria and Sudan pursuant to and as authorized by advisory opinions of, or licenses granted by, OFAC.

Outside of the United States, our money transfer business is subject to some form of regulation in all of the countries
and territories in which we offer those services. These laws and regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services, limitations on the amount of principal that can be sent into or out of a country,
limitations on the number of money transfers that may be sent or received by a consumer and controls on the rates of exchange between currencies. They may also include laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering or
terrorist financing, including reporting requirements similar to those required under the BSA. In most countries, either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer
services.

The Payment Services Directive (“PSD”), which became effective on November 1, 2009,
has changed the payments market in the European Union (“EU”), harmonizing the licensing and certain other requirements for offering payment services within the EU. Previously, those requirements differed significantly among these
countries. The PSD, along with similar laws in other jurisdictions, have imposed new rules on payment service providers like Western Union. In particular, Western Union has become responsible for the regulatory compliance of our agents who are
engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries. The majority of our EU business is managed through our PSD subsidiary, which is regulated by Ireland. Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory action against us because of the actions of our
agents in those areas has increased. Under the PSD, we are subject to investment safeguarding rules and periodic examinations similar to those we are subject to in the



United States. These rules have resulted in increased compliance costs and may lead to increased competition in our areas of service. Additional countries may adopt legislation similar to these
laws. The PSD, as well as legislation in other countries such as Russia, has also allowed an increased number of non-bank entities to become money transfer agents.

We have developed and continue to enhance global compliance programs to monitor and to address various legal and
regulatory requirements. Our money transfer network operates through third-party agents in most countries, and our legal and practical ability to control those agents’ compliance activities is limited. To assist in managing and monitoring money
laundering and terrorist financing risks, we have developed and continue to enhance our global compliance programs, including an anti-money laundering compliance program, which comprises policies, procedures, systems and internal controls. We have
employees in a number of our offices around the world dedicated to our global compliance program efforts. In connection with an agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states entered into in February 2010, we have funded
$71 million, a portion of which was paid to a not-for-profit organization to promote safety and security along the entire United States and Mexico border, with the rest paid to the State of Arizona for its costs associated with this matter.
This agreement and settlement also resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement, we have made and expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along
the United States and Mexico border and a monitor has been engaged for those programs. The costs of the investments in our programs and for the monitor are expected to reach up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013. See also
Item 1A, Risk Factors—

“Western Union is the subject of governmental investigations and consent agreements with or enforcement actions by regulators”

for more information on this agreement and settlement, including the
potential impact on our business.

Government agencies both inside and outside the United States may impose
new or additional rules on money transfers affecting us or our agents or their subagents, including regulations that:

•

prohibit transactions in, to or from certain countries, governments and individuals and entities;

•

impose additional identification, reporting or recordkeeping requirements;

•

limit the types of entities capable of providing money transfer services or impose additional licensing or registration requirements;

•

impose minimum capital or other financial requirements on us or our agents and their subagents;

•

limit or restrict the revenue which may be generated from money transfers, including transaction fees and revenue derived from foreign exchange;

•

require enhanced disclosures to our money transfer customers;

•

require the principal amount of money transfers originated in a country to be invested in that country or held in trust until they are paid;

•

limit the number or principal amount of money transfers which may be sent to or from the jurisdiction, whether by an individual, through one agent
or in aggregate; or

•

impose taxes or fees on money transfer transactions.

Unclaimed Property Regulations

Our Company is
subject to unclaimed property laws in the United States and abroad. These laws require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by our Company that has been unclaimed



for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers and money orders. We hold property subject to unclaimed property laws and we have an ongoing program to comply with the laws. We are
subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices.

Privacy and Information Security Regulations

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of personal information is required to provide our services. These
activities are subject to information security standards, data privacy, data breach and related laws and regulations in the United States and other countries. In the United States, data privacy and data breach laws such as the federal
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various state laws apply directly to a broad range of financial institutions including money transmitters like Western Union, and indirectly to companies that provide services to those institutions. Many state laws require
us to provide notification to affected individuals, state officers and consumer reporting agencies in the event of a security breach of computer databases or physical documents that contain certain types of non-public personal information and
present a risk for unauthorized use.

The collection, transfer, disclosure, use and storage of personal
information required to provide our services is subject to data privacy laws outside of the United States, such as laws adopted pursuant to the EU’s 95/46 EC Directive of the European Parliament (the “Data Protection Directive”),
Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, individual European national laws and data privacy laws of other provinces or countries. In some cases, the laws of a country may be more restrictive than the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the laws developed to comply with the Data Protection Directive may impose additional duties on companies. Each of these laws may restrict the collection, transfer, processing, storage, use and disclosure of sensitive
personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and may give individuals certain rights to prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing.

These regulations, laws and industry standards also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the
issuance of internal data security standards, controls or guidelines.

In connection with regulatory
requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, Western Union makes information available to certain United States federal and state, as well as certain
foreign government agencies when required by law. In recent years, these agencies have increased their requests for such information from Western Union and other companies (both financial service providers and others), particularly in connection
with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or identity theft. During the same period, there has also been increased public attention regarding the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations
intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals—the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the individual’s right to
privacy—may conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we believe that Western Union is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and business environments in these areas are rapidly
changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose Western Union to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage.

Banking Regulation

We have subsidiaries that
operate under banking licenses granted by the Austrian Financial Market Authority and the Brazilian Central Bank which subject these subsidiaries to Austrian and Brazilian regulations. We are also subject to regulation, examination and supervision
by the New York Department of Financial Services (the “Financial Services Department”), which has regulatory authority over our entity that holds all interests in these subsidiaries, a limited liability investment company organized under
Article XII of the New York Banking Law. An Agreement of Supervision with the Financial Services Department imposes various regulatory requirements including operational limitations, capital requirements, affiliate transaction limitations, and
notice and reporting requirements. Financial Services Department approval is required under the New York Banking Law and the Agreement of Supervision prior to any change in control of the Article XII investment company.



Since these subsidiaries do not operate any banking offices in the United
States and do not conduct business in the United States except as may be incidental to their activities outside the United States, our Company’s affiliation with these subsidiaries does not cause them to be subject to the provisions of the Bank
Holding Company Act in the United States.

Other

Some of our services are subject to card association rules and regulations. For example, an independent standards-setting
organization, the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Security Standards Council (including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa Inc. International) developed a set of comprehensive
requirements concerning payment card account security through the transaction process, called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”). All merchants and service providers that store, process and transmit payment card
data are required to comply with PCI DSS as a condition to accepting credit cards. We are subject to annual reviews to ensure compliance with PCI regulations worldwide and are subject to fines if we are found to be non-compliant.

Stored-value services offered by Western Union prepaid services are subject to United States federal and state laws and
regulations, as well as laws and regulations outside of the United States, related to consumer protection, licensing, escheat and money laundering. As we begin offering similar services internationally, those services may be subject to various
country laws. These laws are evolving, and the extent to which they apply to Western Union or its consumers is sometimes unclear. While we are unable to determine the full impact that new laws and changing interpretations may have on these services,
recent history suggests that new rules may, among other things, broaden our liability for the services and increase the scope of the information that we and our agents must collect, maintain and report about consumers.

Employees and Labor

As of January 31, 2012, our businesses employed approximately 8,000 employees, of which approximately 6,000 employees are located outside of the United States.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

There are many factors that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risks described
below. Such risks are grouped according to:

•

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry;

•

Risks Related to Our Regulatory and Litigation Environment; and

•

Risks Related to the Spin-Off.

You should carefully consider all of these risks.

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

If consumers’ confidence in our business or in traditional money transfer and payment service providers
generally deteriorates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our business is built on consumers’ confidence in our brands and our ability to provide fast, reliable money transfer and payment services. Erosion in consumers’ confidence in our business, or
in traditional money transfer and payment service providers as a means to transfer money, could adversely impact transaction volumes which would in turn adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A number of factors could adversely affect consumers’ confidence in our business, or in traditional money transfer
and payment service providers generally, many of which are beyond our control, and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. These factors include:

•

changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations that have the effect of making it more difficult for consumers to transfer money using
traditional money transfer and payment service providers;

•

failure of our agents or subagents to deliver services in accordance with our requirements;

•

reputational concerns resulting from actual or perceived events;

•

actions by federal, state or foreign regulators that interfere with our ability to transfer consumers’ money reliably, for example, attempts to
seize money transfer funds, or limit our ability to or prohibit us from transferring money in certain corridors;

•

federal, state or foreign legal requirements, including those that require us to provide consumer data to a greater extent than is currently
required;

•

any significant interruption in our systems, including by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, vendor failure,
unauthorized entry and computer viruses or disruptions in our workforce; and

•

any breach of our security policies or legal requirements resulting in a compromise of consumer privacy or data use and security.

Many of our money transfer consumers are migrants. Consumer advocacy groups or governmental
agencies could consider migrants to be disadvantaged and entitled to protection, enhanced consumer disclosure, or other different treatment. If consumer advocacy groups are able to generate widespread support for positions that are detrimental to
our business, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.



Difficult conditions in global financial markets, global economic downturns and
financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The global capital and credit markets have experienced in recent years, and in the future may experience, unprecedented volatility and disruption and we face certain risks relating to such events,
including:

•

Our agents or clients could experience reduced sales or business as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions. As a result, our agents
could reduce their numbers of locations or hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether. Businesses using our services may make fewer cross-currency payments or may have fewer customers making payments to them through us, particularly
businesses in those industries that may be more affected by an economic downturn.

•

Our exposure to receivables from our agents, consumers and businesses could impact us. For more information on this risk, see risk factor,
“

We face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents, consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations

.”

•

The market value of the securities in our investment portfolio may substantially decline. The impact of that decline in value may adversely affect
our results of operations and financial condition.

•

The counterparties to the derivative financial instruments that we use to reduce our exposure to various market risks, including changes in interest
rates and foreign exchange rates, may fail to honor their obligations, which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. That failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

•

We aggregate our foreign exchange exposures in our Business Solutions business, including the exposure generated by the derivative contracts we
write to our customers as part of our cross-currency payments business, and typically hedge the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. If our customers fail to honor their obligations or if
the counterparties to our offsetting positions fail to honor their obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

•

We may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness as it becomes due or we may have to refinance on unfavorable terms, which could require us
to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, and other purposes.

•

Our revolving credit facility with a consortium of banks is one source for funding liquidity needs and also backs our commercial paper program. If
any of the banks participating in our credit facility fails to fulfill its lending commitment to us, our short-term liquidity and ability to support borrowings under our commercial paper program could be adversely affected.

•

The third-party service providers on whom we depend may experience difficulties in their businesses, which may impair their ability to provide
services to us and have a potential impact on our own business. The impact of a change or temporary stoppage of services may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

•

Banks upon which we rely to conduct our business could fail or be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. This could lead to our inability to
access funds and/or credit losses for us and could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.

•

If market disruption and volatility occurs, we could experience difficulty in accessing capital and our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely impacted.



Risks associated with operations outside the United States and foreign currencies
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

An increasing
portion of our revenue is generated in currencies other than the United States dollar. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with changes in the value of our revenues denominated in foreign currencies. Our Business Solutions business
provides currency conversion and, in certain countries, foreign exchange hedging services to its customers, further exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk. In order to mitigate these risks, we enter into derivative contracts. However, these
contracts do not eliminate all of the risks related to fluctuating foreign currency rates.

Our foreign
exchange risk is greater, and our foreign exchange risk management is heightened, in our Business Solutions business. The significant majority of Business Solutions’ revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to
make cross-currency payments. In certain countries, this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers. The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. The credit risk associated
with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. Business
Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial
institution counterparties. If we are unable to obtain offsetting positions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

A significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the United States and much of the cash and cash equivalents
from this business are held by our foreign entities. Repatriating these funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at foreign tax rates that are relatively low
compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. If repatriation of these funds is required or if a change in legislation requires a different tax treatment, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely impacted. For further discussion regarding the risk that our future effective tax rates could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally, see risk factor “

Changes in tax laws and
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense

” below.

Money transfers and payments to, from, within, or between countries may be limited or prohibited by law. At
times in the past, we have been required to cease operations in particular countries due to political uncertainties or government restrictions imposed by foreign governments or the United States. Occasionally agents have been required by their
regulators to cease offering our services, see risk factor “

Regulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards affecting our agents or subagents could require changes in our business
model and increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition”

below. Additionally, economic or political instability or natural disasters may make money
transfers to, from, within, or between particular countries difficult or impossible, such as when banks are closed, when currency devaluation makes exchange rates difficult to manage or when natural disasters or civil unrest makes access to agent
locations unsafe. These risks could negatively impact our ability to offer our services, to make payments to or receive payments from international agents or our subsidiaries or our ability to recoup funds that have been advanced to international
agents or are held by our subsidiaries and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the general state of telecommunications and infrastructure in some lesser developed countries, including
countries where we have a large number of transactions, creates operational risks for us and our agents that generally are not present in our operations in the United States and other more developed countries.

Many of our agents outside the United States are post offices, which are usually owned and operated by national
governments. These governments may decide to change the terms under which they allow post offices to offer remittances and other financial services. For example, governments may decide to separate financial service



operations from postal operations, or mandate the creation or privatization of a “post bank” or they may require multiple service providers in their network. These changes could have an
adverse effect on our ability to distribute, offer or price our services in countries that are material to our business.

Interruptions in migration patterns, including as a result of economic conditions, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our consumer-to-consumer money transfer business relies in large
part on migration, which brings workers to countries with greater economic opportunities than those available in their native countries. A significant portion of money transfers are sent by international migrants. Migration is affected by (among
other factors) overall economic conditions, the availability of job opportunities, changes in immigration laws, and political or other events (such as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that would make it more difficult for workers to migrate or
work abroad. Changes to these factors could adversely affect our remittance volume and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Many of our consumers work in industries that may be impacted by deteriorating economic conditions more quickly or
significantly than other industries. Reduced job opportunities, especially in construction, manufacturing, hospitality, agriculture and retail, or overall weakness in the world’s economies could adversely affect the number of money transfer
transactions, the principal amounts transferred and correspondingly our results of operations. If general market softness in the economies of countries important to migrant workers occurs, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Additionally, if our consumer transactions decline, if the amount of money that consumers send per transaction declines, or if migration patterns shift due to weak or deteriorating economic conditions, our results of operations may be adversely
affected.

Our ability to adapt technology in response to changing industry and consumer needs or trends poses a
challenge to our business.

Our ability to compete in the markets we serve may be threatened by
change, including changes in technology, changes with respect to consumer needs, competition and industry standards. We actively seek solutions that respond in a timely manner to new technology-based money transfer services such as Internet,
phone-based money transfer services and prepaid, stored-value and other card-based money transfer services. Failure to respond well to these challenges could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, even
if we respond well to these challenges, the business and financial models offered by many of these alternative, more technology-reliant means of money transfer and electronic payment solutions may be less advantageous to us than the model offered by
our traditional cash/agent model.

Acquisitions and integration of new businesses create risks and may affect operating results.

We have acquired and may acquire businesses both inside and outside the United States. The
acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks. The core risks involve valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence) and integration (managing the complex process of integrating
the acquired company’s people, products and services, technology and other assets in an effort to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the projected synergies of the acquisition). In addition, the need in some cases to
improve regulatory compliance standards is another risk associated with acquiring companies, see “Risks Related to Our Regulatory and Litigation Environment” below. Acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for
example:

•

managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;

•

managing multi-jurisdictional operating, tax and financing structures;

•

integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;



•

integrating the acquired technologies into our Company;

•

realization of anticipated financial benefits from these acquisitions and where necessary, improving internal controls of these acquired businesses;

•

complying with regulatory requirements;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;

•

difficulty entering new markets with the services of the acquired businesses; and

•

general economic and political conditions, including legal and other barriers to cross-border investment in general, or by United States companies
in particular.

Integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or divert resources
from, one or more of our businesses and could result in the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with an acquisition and the integration of the acquired
company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $3,198.9 million of goodwill comprising approximately 35% of our total assets. An impairment review of goodwill is conducted at least once a year (including
qualitative and quantitative assessments) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The assessment of goodwill will be performed more frequently than once a year if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. If we are unsuccessful in integrating the businesses we have acquired or acquire in the future, or if these acquired businesses experience
declines in operating income or cash flows, adverse changes in the business climate, or if we are unable to successfully execute our strategy for these businesses, we may be required to write down the goodwill on our balance sheet associated with
these acquisitions, which could have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods.

We face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents, consumers and businesses that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The vast majority of our global funds transfer
business is conducted through third-party agents that provide our services to consumers at their retail locations. These agents sell our services, collect funds from consumers and are required to pay the proceeds from these transactions to us. As a
result, we have credit exposure to our agents. In some countries, our agent networks include superagents that establish subagent relationships; these agents must collect funds from their subagents in order to pay us. We are not insured against
credit losses, except in certain circumstances related to agent theft or fraud. If an agent becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay money order, money transfer or payment services proceeds to us, we must
nonetheless pay the money order, complete the money transfer or payment services on behalf of the consumer.

The liquidity of our agents is necessary for our business to remain strong and to continue to provide our services. If
our agents fail to settle with us in a timely manner, our liquidity could be affected.

From time to time, we
have made, and may in the future make, short-term advances and longer term loans to our agents. These advances and loans generally are secured by settlement funds payable by us to these agents. However, the failure of these borrowing agents to repay
these advances and loans constitutes a credit risk to us.



In our Business Solutions business, we are also exposed to credit risk
relating to foreign currency forward and option contracts written by us to our customers. The duration of these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign
currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. If a customer becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits
fraud or otherwise fails to pay us for the value of these contracts, we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty.

We offer consumers, primarily in the United States, the ability to transfer money utilizing their credit or debit card
via the Internet and phone. Because these are not face-to-face transactions, these transactions involve a greater risk of fraud. We apply verification and other tools to help authenticate transactions and protect against fraud. However, these tools
are not always successful in protecting us against fraud. As the merchant of these transactions, we may bear the financial risk of the full amount sent in some of the fraudulent transactions. Issuers of credit and debit cards may also incur losses
due to fraudulent transactions through our distribution channels and may elect to block transactions by their cardholders in these channels with or without notice. We may be subject to additional fees or penalties if the amount of chargebacks
exceeds a certain percentage of our transaction volume. Such fees and penalties escalate over time if we do not take effective action to reduce chargebacks below the threshold, and if chargeback levels are not ultimately reduced to acceptable
levels, our merchant accounts could be suspended or revoked, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

Breaches of our information security policies or safeguards could adversely affect our ability to operate and could damage our
reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We collect, transfer and retain
consumer, business, employee and agent data as part of our business. These activities are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions, see risk factor “

Current and proposed regulation addressing consumer
privacy and data use and security could increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition

”

below. The requirements imposed by these laws and regulations,
which often differ materially among the many jurisdictions, are designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed. We have developed and maintain technical and operational
safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, despite those safeguards, it is possible that hackers, employees acting contrary to our policies or others could improperly access our systems or improperly obtain or
disclose data about our consumers, business customers, agents and/or employees. Further, because some data is collected and stored by third parties, it is possible that a third party could intentionally or negligently disclose personal data in
violation of law. Also, in some jurisdictions we transfer data related to our employees, business customers, consumers, agents and potential employees to third-party vendors in order to perform due diligence and for other reasons. It is possible
that a vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose such data. Any breach of our security policies or applicable legal requirements resulting in a compromise of consumer, business, employee or agent data could require us to notify impacted
individuals, and in some cases regulators, of a possible or actual breach, expose us to regulatory enforcement action, including fines, limit our ability to provide services, subject us to litigation and/or damage our reputation.

Interruptions in our systems or disruptions in our workforce may have a significant effect on our business.

Our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer
information systems and those of our service providers. Any significant interruptions could harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of consumers. These systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire,
natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or other causes, many of which may be beyond our control or that of our service providers. Although we have taken steps to
prevent systems disruptions, our measures may not be successful and we may experience problems other than system disruptions. We also may experience software defects, development delays, installation difficulties and other systems problems, which
would harm our business



and reputation and expose us to potential liability which may not be fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Our data applications may not be sufficient to address technological
advances, regulatory requirements, changing market conditions or other developments. In addition, any work stoppages or other labor actions by employees, the significant majority of which are located outside the United States, who support our
systems or perform any of our major functions could adversely affect our business.

If we are unable to maintain our
agent, subagent or global business payments networks under terms consistent with those currently in place, or if our agents or subagents fail to comply with Western Union business and technology standards and contract requirements our business,
financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Most of our
consumer-to-consumer revenue is derived through our agent network. In addition, our international agents may have subagent relationships in which we are not directly involved. Transaction volumes at existing agent and subagent locations often
increase over time and new agents and subagents provide us with additional revenue. If, due to competition or other reasons, agents or subagents decide to leave our network, or if we are unable to sign new agents or maintain our agent network under
terms consistent with those currently in place, or if our agents are unable to maintain relationships with or sign new subagents, our revenue and profit growth rates may be adversely affected. Agent attrition might occur for a number of reasons,
including a competitor engaging an agent or an agent’s dissatisfaction with its relationship with us or the revenue derived from that relationship. In addition, agents may generate fewer transactions or less revenue for various reasons,
including increased competition, political unrest or changes in the economy. Because an agent is a third party that engages in a variety of activities in addition to providing our services, it may encounter business difficulties unrelated to its
provision of our services, which could cause the agent to reduce its number of locations, hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether.

We rely on our agents’ information systems and/or processes to obtain transaction data. If an agent or subagent loses information, if there is a significant disruption to the information systems of
an agent or subagent, or if an agent or subagent does not maintain the appropriate controls over their systems, we may experience reputational harm which could result in losses to the Company.

We have relationships with more than 10,000 consumer payments businesses to which our customers can make payments. These
relationships are a core component of our global business payments services, and we derive a substantial portion of our global business payments revenue through these relationships. If we are unable to sign new relationships or maintain our current
relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place, our revenue and profit growth rates may be adversely affected.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies.

If our credit ratings are downgraded, or if they are placed under review or given a negative outlook, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged, which could adversely affect our relationships with our agents, particularly those agents that are financial
institutions or post offices. In addition, an adverse credit rating by a rating agency, such as a downgrade or negative outlook, could result in regulators imposing additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on
the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Also, a significant downgrade could increase our costs of borrowing money, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We face competition from global and niche or corridor money transfer providers, United
States and international banks, card associations, card-based payments providers and a number of other types of service providers, including electronic and Internet providers. Our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively in the
industry.

Money transfer and global business payments are highly competitive industries which include
service providers from a variety of financial and non-financial business groups. Our competitors include banks, credit unions, automated teller machine providers and operators, card associations, card-based payments providers such as issuers of
e-money, travel cards or stored-value cards, informal remittance systems, web-based services, phone payment systems (including mobile phone networks), postal organizations, retailers, check cashers, mail and courier services, currency exchanges and
traditional money transfer companies. These services are differentiated by features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network size, hours of operations, loyalty programs, reliability and price. Our continued growth depends on our
ability to compete effectively in these industries. We have made periodic pricing decreases in response to competition and to implement our brand investment strategy, which includes better meeting consumer needs, maximizing market opportunities and
strengthening our overall competitive positioning. Pricing decreases generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes. In addition, failure to compete on service differentiation could
significantly affect our future growth potential and results of operations.

As noted above, many of our
agents outside the United States are national post offices. These entities are usually governmental organizations that may enjoy special privileges or protections that could allow them to simultaneously develop their own money transfer businesses.
International postal organizations could agree to establish a money transfer network among themselves. Due to the size of these organizations and the number of locations they have, any such network could represent significant competition to us.
Because these entities are governmental organizations, they may be able to—or be required to—offer their money transfer services to the public at, near or below their cost of providing such services.

Our ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to protect our brands and our other intellectual property rights
and to defend ourselves against potential intellectual property infringement claims.

The Western
Union brand, which is protected by trademark registrations in many countries, is material to our Company. The loss of the Western Union trademark or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with the name would harm our business. Similar to
the Western Union trademark, the Vigo, Orlandi Valuta, Speedpay, Paymap, Equity Accelerator, Just in Time EFT, Pago Fácil, Western Union Payments, Western Union Quick Collect, Quick Pay, Quick Cash, Convenience Pay, Western Union Business
Solutions and other trademarks and service marks are also important to our Company and a loss of the service mark or trademarks or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with these names could harm our business.

Our intellectual property rights are an important element in the value of our business. Our failure to take appropriate
actions against those who infringe upon our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business either do not recognize intellectual property rights or do not protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Adverse
determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings in the United States or in foreign countries could impair our ability to sell our services or license or protect our intellectual property, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We have been, are and in the future may be, subject to claims alleging
that our technology or business methods infringe patents owned by others, both inside and outside the United States. Unfavorable resolution of these claims could require us to change how we deliver a service, result in significant financial
consequences, or both, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Changes in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax
expense.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both
domestically and internationally. From time to time, the United States Congress and foreign, state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rates. If changes to applicable tax laws are enacted, our results of
operations could be negatively impacted.

Our tax returns and positions (including positions regarding
jurisdictional authority of foreign governments to impose tax) are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby
negatively impacting our results of operations. We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2011, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of
$144.4 million, including accrued interest and penalties. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected
tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve, and such resolution could have a material effect on our effective tax
rate, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the current period and/or future periods. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes
during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any difference from the Company’s tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during
the period. Such resolution could increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows. For example, we recently reached an agreement with the United States
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003, which resulted in a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves
associated with this matter and will require cash payments to the IRS and various state tax authorities of approximately $190 million. See Item 7 of Part II, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations; Capital Resources and Liquidity.

We receive services from third-party vendors that would be difficult to
replace if those vendors ceased providing such services which could cause temporary disruption to our business.

Some services relating to our business, such as software application support, the development, hosting and maintenance of our operating systems, check clearing, and processing of returned checks are
outsourced to third-party vendors, which would be difficult to replace quickly. If our third-party vendors were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future, our business and operations could be adversely affected.

Material changes in the market value or liquidity of the securities we hold may adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

As of December 31, 2011, we held $1.3 billion in investment
securities, substantially all of which are state and municipal debt securities. The majority of this money represents the principal of money transfers sent by consumers and money orders issued by us to consumers in the United States. We regularly
monitor our credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and by diversifying our investments. As of December 31, 2011, the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of
“AA–” or better from a major credit rating agency. Despite those ratings, it is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions, credit issues, the
viability of the issuer of the security, failure by a fund manager to manage the investment portfolio consistently with the fund prospectus or increases in interest rates. Any such decline in value may adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.



The trust holding the assets of our pension plan has assets totaling
approximately $301.7 million as of December 31, 2011. The fair value of these assets held in the trust are compared to the plan’s projected benefit obligation to determine the pension liability of $112.7 million recorded within
“Other liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. We attempt to mitigate risk through diversification, and we regularly monitor investment risk on our portfolio through quarterly investment portfolio
reviews and periodic asset and liability studies. Despite these measures, it is possible that the value of our portfolio may decline in the future due to any number of factors, including general market conditions and credit issues. Such declines
could have an impact on the funded status of our pension plan and future funding requirements.

We have substantial debt obligations
that could restrict our operations.

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately
$3.6 billion in consolidated indebtedness, and we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.

Our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:

•

limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;

•

increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;

•

limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;

•

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes.

There would be
adverse tax consequences associated with using certain earnings generated outside the United States to pay the interest and principal on our indebtedness. Accordingly, this portion of our cash flow will be unavailable under normal circumstances to
service our debt obligations.

Risks Related to Our Regulatory and Litigation Environment

As described under Item 1 of Part I, our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by
the United States federal government, each of the states (including licensing requirements), many localities and many other countries and jurisdictions, such as the European Union. Regulations to which we are subject include financial services
regulations, consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, money transfer, payment instrument, and foreign exchange derivative licensing regulations, unclaimed property laws, competition laws and laws covering
consumer privacy, data protection and information security. The failure by us, our agents or subagents to comply with any such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could
seriously damage our reputation and brands, and result in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs.

Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist
financing, fraud and other illicit activity. Failure by us, our agents or our subagents to comply with those laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our services are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and
prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with



little notice. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibit or restrict transactions
to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or
terrorist organizations. As United States federal and state as well as foreign legislative and regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect that our costs of complying with these requirements will increase,
perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements—by us or by our agents or their subagents (each of whom are third parties over which we have limited legal and practical control) could result in the suspension or
revocation of a license or registration required to provide money transfer services, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including
fines.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) in
the United States and similar laws in other countries, such as the Bribery Act in the United Kingdom, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose
of obtaining or retaining business. Some of these laws, such as the Bribery Act, also prohibit improper payments between commercial enterprises. Because our services are offered in virtually every country of the world, we face a higher risk
associated with FCPA and United Kingdom Bribery Act compliance than many other companies. Any determination that we have violated these laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our United States business is subject to reporting, recordkeeping and anti-money laundering provisions of
the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and to regulatory oversight and enforcement by the United States Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). We have
subsidiaries that are subject to banking regulations, primarily those in Brazil and Austria. These subsidiaries are also subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the New York Department of Financial Services. Under the Payment Services
Directive (“PSD”) in the European Union (“EU”), which became effective in late 2009, and similar legislation enacted or proposed in other jurisdictions, we have and will increasingly become directly subject to reporting,
recordkeeping and anti-money laundering regulations. These laws could also increase competition in some or all of our areas of service.

The remittance industry has come under increasing scrutiny from government regulators and others in connection with its ability to prevent its services from being abused by people seeking to defraud
others. While we believe our fraud prevention efforts are effective and comply with applicable law and best practices, the ingenuity of criminal fraudsters, combined with the potential susceptibility to fraud by consumers during economically
difficult times, make the prevention of consumer fraud a significant and challenging problem. Our failure to continue to help prevent such frauds or a change in laws or their interpretation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our fees, profit margins and/or foreign exchange spreads may be reduced or limited
because of regulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards that are either industry wide or specifically targeted at our Company.

The evolving regulatory environment, including increased fees or taxes, regulatory initiatives, changes in laws,
regulations and industry practices and standards imposed by state, federal or international governments and expectations regarding our compliance efforts, are impacting the manner in which we operate our business and may change the competitive
landscape and adversely affect our financial results. New and proposed legislation relating to financial services providers and consumer protection in various jurisdictions around the world has and may continue to affect the manner in which we
provide our services, see risk factor “

The Dodd-Frank Act, as



well as the regulations required by that Act and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could adversely affect us and the scope of our activities, and could adversely affect
our operations, results of operations and financial condition

.” Recently proposed and enacted legislation related to financial services providers and consumer protection in various jurisdictions around the world and at the federal and state
level in the United States may subject us to additional regulatory oversight, mandate additional consumer disclosures and remedies, including refunds to consumers, mandate additional taxes or fees to be imposed upon consumers, or otherwise impact
the manner in which we provide our services. If governments implement new laws or regulations that limit our right to set fees and/or foreign exchange spreads, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected. In addition, changes in regulatory expectations, interpretations or practices could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties.

For example, our business is currently being affected by on-going changes to our compliance procedures related to our
agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona. See risk factor “

Western Union is the subject of governmental investigations and consent agreements with or enforcement actions by regulators.

” Due to regulatory initiatives, we
will continue to evolve our business model and practices along the United States and Mexico border, including in the southwestern region of the United States. Such changes will likely have an adverse effect on our revenues, profits, and business
operations.

In addition, one state has passed a law imposing a fee on certain money transfer transactions,
and certain other states have proposed similar legislation. At least two foreign countries have enacted rules imposing taxes or fees on certain money transfer transactions, as well. Although money transfer services themselves are not generally
subject to sales tax on money transfer services elsewhere in the United States, the current budget shortfalls in many jurisdictions, combined with continued federal inaction on comprehensive immigration reform, may lead other states or localities to
impose similar taxes or fees. Similar circumstances in foreign countries could invoke similar consequences. A tax or fee exclusively on money transfer services like Western Union could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other means of
remittance which are not subject to the same taxes or fees.

Other examples of changes to our financial
environment include the possibility of regulatory initiatives that focus on lowering international remittance costs. For example, Pakistan subsidizes certain remittances into the country from Pakistanis working abroad. We do not participate in this
program, but remittance companies accepting the subsidy are prohibited from charging fees to the sender or receiver. Such initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Regulators around the world increasingly look at each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments and other
industries. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries, states or regions. This includes the interpretation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(the “Act”). Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one service may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another service. As a result, the risks created by any one new law or regulation
are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated, affecting our business in another place or involving another service. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our services,
fees and other important aspects of our business, with the same effect. Either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our agents’ or subagents’ failure to comply with federal and laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations outside
the United States could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any determination that our agents or subagents have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation and brands, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating
costs. In some cases, we could be liable for the failure of our agents or subagents to comply with laws which also could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



For example, under the PSD, Western Union is responsible for the compliance
of its agents who are engaged by one of our payments institution subsidiaries. The majority of our EU business is managed through our PSD subsidiaries. Thus, the risk of adverse regulatory action against Western Union because of actions by its
agents in those areas has increased.

We may become liable for the failure of our money transfer agents to
comply with the Act, the extent of which liability will be determined by rules not yet finalized. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) created by the Act has recently issued regulations implementing remittance
provisions of the Act, which will impose responsibility on us for any related compliance failures of our agents.

The changes associated with the PSD, the Act and similar legislation enacted or proposed in other countries could result in increased costs to comply with the new requirements, or in the event we or our
agents are unable to comply, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional countries may adopt similar legislation.

Regulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards affecting our agents or subagents could require changes in our business model and increase our costs of
operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition.

Our agents are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements, which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are
subject to change. A material change in the regulatory requirements for offering money transfer services in a jurisdiction important to our business could mean increased costs and/or operational demands on our agents and subagents, which could
result in their attrition, a decrease in the number of locations at which money transfer services are offered and other negative consequences. The regulatory status of our agents could affect their ability to offer our services. For example, our
agents in the United States are considered Money Service Businesses, or “MSBs,” under the BSA. An increasing number of banks view MSBs, as a class, as higher risk customers for purposes of their anti-money laundering programs. Furthermore,
some of our domestic and international agents have had difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships due to the banks’ policies. If a significant number of agents are unable to maintain existing or establish new banking
relationships, they may not be able to continue to offer our services.

The types of enterprises that are
legally authorized to act as our agents vary significantly from one country to another. Changes in the laws affecting the kinds of entities that are permitted to act as money transfer agents (such as changes in requirements for capitalization or
ownership) could adversely affect our ability to distribute our services and the cost of providing such services, both by us and our agents. For example, a requirement that a money transfer provider be a bank or other highly regulated financial
entity could increase significantly the cost of providing our services in many countries where that requirement does not exist today or could prevent us from offering our services in an affected country. Further, any changes in law that would
require us to provide directly the money transfer services to consumers as opposed to through an agent network (which would effectively change our business model) or that would prohibit or impede the use of subagents could significantly adversely
impact our ability to provide our services, and/or the cost of our services, in the relevant jurisdiction. Changes mandated by laws which make Western Union responsible for any acts of its agents while they are providing the Western Union money
transfer service increase our risk of regulatory liability and our costs to monitor our agents’ performance.

Although most of our Orlandi Valuta and Vigo branded agents are not exclusive, most of our Western Union branded agents offer our services on an exclusive basis—that is, they have agreed by contract
not to provide any non-Western Union branded money transfer services. While we expect to continue signing agents under exclusive arrangements and believe that these agreements are valid and enforceable, changes in laws regulating competition or in
the interpretation of those laws could undermine our ability to enforce them in the future. Recently, several countries in Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and South Asia, including India, have promulgated laws or
regulations, or authorities in these countries have issued orders, which



effectively prohibit payment service providers, such as money transfer companies, from agreeing to exclusive arrangements with agents in those countries. Certain institutions, non-governmental
organizations (“NGOs”) and others are actively advocating against exclusive arrangements in money transfer agent agreements. Advocates for laws prohibiting or limiting exclusivity continue to push for enactment of similar laws in other
jurisdictions. In addition, certain of our agents and subagents have refused to enter into exclusive arrangements. For example, we recently entered into a non-exclusive arrangement with our Mexican agent, Elektra del Milenio de C.V. The inability to
enter into exclusive arrangements or to enforce our exclusivity rights under our contracts could adversely affect our operations and revenue by, for example, allowing competitors to benefit from the goodwill associated with the Western Union brand
at our agent locations.

Western Union is the subject of governmental investigations and consent agreements with or
enforcement actions by regulators.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) served one of our subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents in connection with an investigation into money transfers, including related foreign exchange rates, from the United
States to the Dominican Republic from 2004 through the date of subpoena. The Company is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. Due to the stage of the investigation, we are unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible
loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against us. Should such charges or claims be brought, we could face significant fines, damage awards or
regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

On February 11, 2010, we signed an agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required us to fund a multi-state not-for-profit
organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. The agreement also required us to make payments to the State of Arizona for its costs
associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement, we have made and expect to make certain investments in and changes to our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor has been engaged
for those programs. The costs of the investments in our programs and for the monitor are expected to reach up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013. The monitor has made a number of recommendations related to our compliance
programs.

We are in the process of making certain changes to our compliance program for transactions from the
United States to Mexico, including:

•

revisions to agent agreements to increase our ability to oversee the compliance of our agents and subagents;

•

reduced thresholds at which our consumers are required to provide identification for transactions from certain states along the United States
southwest border; and

•

enhancement of our information systems including migrating customer information for our Western Union, Orlandi Valuta and Vigo brands onto a common
database and migrating to a standard point of sale system.

Such changes will likely have an
adverse effect on our United States to Mexico business. Any additional changes that we elect or are required to make in the United States to Mexico corridor, or similar changes that we may elect or be required to make in other corridors, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Over the past
several years, we have entered into consent agreements with federal and state authorities, including FinCEN, the New York Department of Financial Services, the California Department of Financial Institutions and the Arizona Department of Financial
Institutions, relating to the BSA and anti-money laundering



requirements and related consumer identification matters. These agreements required us to pay civil penalties and to take certain measures to enhance our compliance with recordkeeping, reporting,
training and agent oversight requirements under applicable state and federal law. The consent agreements with the New York Department of Financial Services and the California Department of Financial Institutions were lifted during 2008. However, the
financial services industry and businesses like ours continue to be under significant federal and state regulatory scrutiny with respect to the BSA and anti-money laundering compliance matters. It is possible that as a result of periodic
examinations or otherwise, we could be subject to deficiency findings, fines, criminal penalties, asset seizures or enforcement actions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Western Union has received Civil Investigative Demands from certain state attorneys general who have initiated an
investigation into whether the Company took adequate steps to help prevent consumer fraud from 2010 to 2011. The Civil Investigative Demands seek information and documents relating to consumer fraud complaints that the Company has received and
the Company’s procedures to help identify and prevent fraudulent transfers. Due to the stage of the investigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which
could be associated with any possible civil claims that might be brought by one or more of the states. Should such claims be brought, we could face significant fines, damage awards, or regulatory consequences, or compulsory changes in our
business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the regulations required by that Act and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
could adversely affect us and the scope of our activities, and could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition.

The Act, which became law in the United States on July 21, 2010, calls for significant structural reforms and new substantive regulation across the financial services industry. In addition, the Act
created the CFPB, whose purpose is to issue and enforce consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money transfer services. The CFPB will create additional regulatory oversight for us. The Act and actions by
the CFPB could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to limit or change our business practices, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, requiring us to invest valuable management time and resources in
compliance efforts, imposing additional costs on us, limiting fees we can charge for services, requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, impacting the value of our assets, delaying our ability to respond
to marketplace changes, requiring us to alter our products and services in a manner that would make our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability to offer them profitably, or requiring us to make other changes that could adversely
affect our business.

The CFPB has recently issued regulations implementing the remittance provisions of the
Act. These regulations, which become effective in February 2013, will impact our business in a variety of areas. These include a requirement to provide enhanced pre-transaction disclosures; an obligation to resolve various errors, including certain
errors that may be outside of a remittance provider’s control; and an obligation to cancel certain transactions at a consumer’s request. These requirements and other potential changes under CFPB regulations could adversely affect our
operations and financial results and change the way we operate our business.

We may also be subject to
examination by the CFPB, which has initiated a rulemaking process to define “larger participants of a market for other consumer financial products or services.” Companies that are included in a final rule will be subject to direct
supervision by the CFPB, which may involve providing reports to the CFPB and being examined by the CFPB. The scope, frequency, and details of these reports and examinations are still being developed by the CFPB. In addition, the CFPB has broad
authority to enforce consumer financial laws. In July 2011, many consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking agency and other agencies were transferred to the CFPB. The CFPB has a large budget and staff, and has
broad authority with respect to our money transfer service and related business. It is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer



complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer
financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. The CFPB's authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or to rescind or ignore past
regulatory guidance, could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Our litigation exposure may also be increased by the CFPB's authority to limit or ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses.

Furthermore, rules adopted under the Act by governmental agencies may subject our corporate interest rate and foreign
exchange hedging transactions to centralized clearing, centralized trading, collateral posting and other requirements. Also, our Business Solutions business in the United States may be subjected to increased regulatory oversight and licensing
requirements relating to the foreign exchange derivative products offered to certain of its customers. In addition, the Act establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Counsel that is authorized to designate as “systemically important”
non-bank financial companies and payment systems. Companies designated under either standard will become subject to new regulation and regulatory supervision. If we were designated under either standard, the additional regulatory and supervisory
requirements could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business.

The
effect of the Act and the CFPB on our business and operations will be significant, in part because some of the Act’s implementing regulations have not been issued and the function and scope of the CFPB, the reactions of our competitors and the
responses of consumers and other marketplace participants are uncertain.

Western Union has been the subject of
class-action litigation, and remains the subject of other litigation.

Western Union has been the
subject of class-action litigation in the United States, alleging that its foreign exchange rate disclosures failed to adequately inform consumers about the revenue that Western Union and its agents derive from international remittances. These suits
were all settled in or before 2004, without an admission of liability, and we have made changes in our advertising and consumer forms. Recent changes in law will require, and future changes in law or future litigation or regulatory action may
require, that we modify our disclosures or our practices further. These modifications could be costly to implement, restrict our ability to advertise or promote our services, limit the amount of our foreign exchange income and/or change our
consumers’ behavior.

In addition, as a Company that provides global financial services primarily to
consumers, we could be subject to future class-action lawsuits, other litigation or regulatory action alleging violations of consumer protection or other laws. We also are subject to claims asserted by consumers based on individual transactions.

The Company and one of its subsidiaries are defendants in two purported class action lawsuits: James P.
Tennille v. The Western Union Company and Robert P. Smet v. The Western Union Company, both of which are pending in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The original complaints asserted claims for violation of
various consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, conversion and declaratory relief, based on allegations that the Company waits too long to inform consumers if their money transfers are not redeemed by the recipients and that we use the
unredeemed funds to generate income until the funds are escheated to state governments. For more information, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.

Additional civil actions or any criminal actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our
costs of operations, which could adversely affect our operations, results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to requirements relating to privacy and data use and security under federal, state and foreign laws. Failure to comply with existing privacy and data use and security laws and regulations
to which we are subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions,



penalties or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, overall business and reputation. While we believe that
we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose us to increased
program costs, liability and reputational damage.

In addition, in connection with regulatory requirements to
assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, we make information available to certain United States federal, state and local, as well as certain foreign government
agencies when required by law. In recent years, these agencies have increased their requests for such information from us and other companies (both financial service providers and others), particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist
financing. During the same period, there has also been increased public attention regarding the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information
security and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals—the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and identity theft and the protection of the individual’s right to privacy—may conflict, and the law in these areas is not
consistent or settled.

We are subject to unclaimed property laws, and differences between the amounts we have accrued
for unclaimed property and amounts that are claimed by a state or foreign jurisdiction could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to unclaimed property laws in the United States and abroad which require us to turn over to certain
government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time, such as unpaid money transfers. We hold property subject to unclaimed property laws and we have an ongoing program to comply with those
laws. In addition, we are subject to audits with regard to our escheatment practices. Any difference between the amounts we have accrued for unclaimed property and amounts that are claimed by a state or foreign jurisdiction could have a significant
impact on our results of operations and cash flows. See “Unclaimed Property Regulations” for further discussion.

Our consolidated balance sheet may not contain sufficient amounts or types of regulatory capital to meet the changing requirements
of our various regulators worldwide, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our regulators expect us to possess sufficient financial soundness and strength to adequately support our regulated subsidiaries. We have substantial indebtedness as of December 31, 2011, which could
make it more difficult to meet these requirements if such requirements are increased. In addition, although we are not a bank holding company for purposes of United States law or the law of any other jurisdiction, as a global provider of
payments services and in light of the changing regulatory environment in various jurisdictions, we could become subject to new capital requirements introduced or imposed by our regulators that could require us to issue securities that would qualify
as Tier 1 regulatory capital under the Basel Committee accords or retain earnings over a period of time. Also, our regulators specify the amount and composition of settlement assets that certain of our subsidiaries must hold in order to
satisfy our outstanding settlement obligations. These regulators could further restrict the type of instruments that qualify as settlement assets or these regulators could require our regulated subsidiaries to maintain higher levels of
settlement assets. Any change or increase in these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Relating to the Spin-Off

We were incorporated in
Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed 100% of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent,
as well as related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously owned subsidiary.



If the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, First Data and its
stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify First Data for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax allocation agreement.

First Data received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, the Spin-off (including certain related
transactions) qualifies as tax-free to First Data, us and First Data stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes under sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, assuming, among other things, the
accuracy of the representations made by First Data with respect to certain matters on which the IRS did not rule. If the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request were determined to be untrue or incomplete,
then First Data and ourselves would not be able to rely on the ruling.

The Spin-off was conditioned upon
First Data’s receipt of an opinion of Sidley Austin LLP, counsel to First Data, to the effect that, with respect to requirements on which the IRS did not rule, those requirements would be satisfied. The opinion was based on, among other things,
certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by First Data and us which, if untrue or incomplete, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the
IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion.

If, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling
and opinion of tax counsel, the Spin-off were determined to be a taxable transaction, each holder of First Data common stock who received shares of our common stock in connection with the Spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable
distribution in an amount equal to the fair value of our common stock received. First Data would recognize taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair value of the consideration received by First Data in the contribution over First Data’s tax
basis in the assets contributed to us in the contribution. If First Data were unable to pay any taxes for which it is responsible under the tax allocation agreement, the IRS might seek to collect such taxes from Western Union.

Even if the Spin-off otherwise qualified as a tax-free distribution under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code,
the Spin-off may result in significant United States federal income tax liabilities to First Data if 50% or more of First Data’s stock or our stock (in each case, by vote or value) is treated as having been acquired, directly or indirectly, by
one or more persons as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Spin-off. For purposes of this test, any acquisitions, or any understanding, arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition, within two
years before or after the Spin-off are subject to special scrutiny.

With respect to taxes and other
liabilities that could be imposed as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant tax opinion) (“Spin-off Related
Taxes”), we, one of our affiliates or any person that, after the Spin-off, is an affiliate thereof, will be liable to First Data for any such Spin-off Related Taxes attributable solely to actions taken by or with respect to us. In addition, we
will also be liable for 50% of any Spin-off Related Taxes (i) that would not have been imposed but for the existence of both an action by us and an action by First Data or (ii) where we and First Data each take actions that, standing
alone, would have resulted in the imposition of such Spin-off Related Taxes. We may be similarly liable if we breach certain representations or covenants set forth in the tax allocation agreement. If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes
incurred as a result of the Spin-off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

PROPERTIES

Properties and Facilities

As of December 31, 2011, we have offices in approximately 60 countries, which includes five owned
facilities and approximately 25 United States and 400 international leased properties. Our owned facilities include our corporate headquarters located in Englewood, Colorado.

Our owned and leased facilities are used for operational, sales and administrative purposes in support of both our
consumer-to-consumer and global business payments segments and are all currently being utilized. In certain locations, our offices include customer service centers, where our employees answer operational questions from agents and customers. Our
office in Dublin, Ireland serves as our international headquarters.

We believe that our facilities are
suitable and adequate for our current business; however, we periodically review our facility requirements and may acquire new facilities to meet the needs of our business or consolidate and dispose of or sublet facilities which are no longer
required.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Western Union has received Civil Investigative Demands from certain state attorneys general who have initiated an investigation into whether the Company took adequate steps to help prevent consumer fraud
from 2010 to 2011. The Civil Investigative Demands seek information and documents relating to consumer fraud complaints that the Company has received and the Company’s procedures to help identify and prevent fraudulent transfers. Due
to the stage of the investigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with any possible civil claims that might be brought by one or more of the
states. Should such claims be brought, we could face significant fines, damage awards, or regulatory consequences, or compulsory changes in our business practices, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

In October 2011, Elektra del Milenio de C.V. (“Elektra”), the
Company’s largest agent in Mexico, served a Demand for Arbitration on two of the Company's subsidiaries, alleging that the Company’s subsidiaries intentionally breached obligations relating to exclusivity in the parties’ International
Money Transfer Agreement. Elektra claimed that the alleged breach caused it to lose profits that it would otherwise have earned from offering the Company’s services or other money transfer services. The Company’s subsidiaries responded to
the Demand for Arbitration. In February 2012, all claims relating to this matter were resolved through a confidential settlement in which no party admitted fault.

On July 26, 2010, U.F.C.W. Local 1776 & Participating Employers Pension Fund filed a Verified Shareholder
Double Derivative Complaint and Jury Demand in United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the Company’s Board of Directors failed to appropriately oversee the Company’s compliance program, particularly in
regard to the alleged deficiencies which resulted in the Company’s agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states in early 2010. In addition to naming the Company’s Board members as individual defendants, the complaint
names the Company and its subsidiary Western Union Financial Services, Inc. as nominal defendants. The complaint seeks damages from the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets and an order requiring various
corrective measures. On September 10, 2010, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On September 23, 2010, the plaintiff re-filed the complaint in
Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona. The complaint was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. On September 29, 2011, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds. On
December 15, 2011, the Company and Western Union Financial Services, Inc. filed a Notice of Settlement. The terms of the settlement are set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding attached to the Notice of Settlement and include corporate
governance changes that the Company and Western Union Financial



Services, Inc. have agreed to make relating to anti-money laundering monitoring. The Memorandum of Understanding also indicates that the individual defendants deny any wrongdoing or liability
with respect to the plaintiff’s claims and that the settlement does not constitute an admission of liability of wrongdoing by any party. None of the defendants will be required to pay monetary damages. The plaintiff’s counsel is seeking
attorney’s fees and expenses from the Company not to exceed $850,000. Defendants have agreed not to oppose the amount of a requested fee and expense award up to that amount. The settlement and the attorney’s fee and expense award are
subject to the approval of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.

In the second
quarter of 2009, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) served one of the Company’s subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents in connection with an investigation into money
transfers, including related foreign exchange rates, from the United States to the Dominican Republic from 2004 through the date of subpoena. The Company is cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. Due to the stage of the investigation, the
Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company.
Should such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company is a party to a variety of legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business.
While the results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
condition.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WU.” There were
4,763 stockholders of record as of February 17, 2012. This figure does not include an estimate of the indeterminate number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies. The following
table presents the high and low prices of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as well as dividends declared per share during the calendar quarter indicated.

The following table sets forth stock repurchases for each of the three months of the
quarter ended December 31, 2011:

*

These amounts represent both shares authorized by the Board of Directors for repurchase under a publicly announced plan, as described below, as well
as shares withheld from employees to cover tax withholding obligations on restricted stock awards and units that have vested.

**

On February 1, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion of common stock repurchases through December 31, 2012, of which
$615.5 million remains available as of December 31, 2011. Management has historically and may continue to establish prearranged written plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1. A Rule 10b5-1 plan permits us to repurchase shares at times when we
may otherwise be unable to do so, provided the plan is adopted when we are not aware of material non-public information.

Refer to Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to our equity compensation plans.



Dividend Policy

During 2011, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share payable on
December 30, 2011, October 7, 2011 and June 30, 2011, and $0.07 per common share payable on March 31, 2011. During 2010, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common share payable on
December 31, 2010, and $0.06 per common share payable on October 14, 2010, June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010. The declaration and amount of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors and will depend on our
financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and any other factors that the Board of Directors believes are relevant. As a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our
subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends in future periods will be dependent on our receiving dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Several of our operating subsidiaries are subject to financial services regulations and their ability to pay
dividends may be restricted.

On February 7, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.10 per share payable on March 30, 2012.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a consolidated basis and includes the accounts of the Company and our majority-owned subsidiaries. Our selected historical
financial data are not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition, future results of operations or future cash flows.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

(a)

Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 included $129.9 million, $111.0 million and $30.8 million, respectively,
of revenue related to the Custom House acquisition in September 2009, which has subsequently been rebranded to “Western Union Business Solutions.” Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $35.2 million of revenue related
to Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”), which was acquired in November 2011.



(b)

Our stock-based compensation expense in 2007 included a charge of $22.3 million related to the vesting of the remaining converted unvested
Western Union stock-based awards upon the completion of the acquisition of First Data Corporation on September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

(c)

Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $46.8 million and $59.5 million of restructuring and related
expenses, respectively, associated with a restructuring plan designed to reduce overall headcount and migrate positions from various facilities, primarily within the United States and Europe, to regional operating centers. Operating expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2008 included $82.9 million of restructuring and related expenses associated with the closure of our facilities in Missouri and Texas and other reorganization plans. No restructuring and related expenses were
incurred during 2009 or 2007.

(d)

Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 included an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from an agreement and settlement,
which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required us to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas
and New Mexico have participated with Arizona. The settlement agreement was signed on February 11, 2010.

(e)

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with loans previously
made to certain existing agents.

(f)

Interest expense primarily relates to our outstanding borrowings.

(g)

In 2011, we recognized gains of $20.5 million and $29.4 million, in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interests in Finint,
S.r.l. and Angelo Costa, S.r.l., respectively, to fair value. These equity interests were remeasured in conjunction with our purchases of the remaining interests in these entities that we previously did not hold. Additionally, in 2011, we recognized
a $20.8 million net gain on foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of less than one year entered into in order to reduce the economic variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition. In 2009, given the increased uncertainty, at that time, surrounding the numerous third-party legal claims associated with our receivable from the Reserve International Liquidity
Fund, Ltd., we reserved $12.0 million representing the estimated impact of a pro-rata distribution. In 2010, we recorded a recovery of this reserve of $6.3 million due to the final settlement of this receivable.

(h)

In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS Agreement”) resolving substantially all of
the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter.

(i)

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a $250 million tax deposit
made relating to United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring, which were previously accrued in our consolidated financial statements. Also impacting net cash provided by operating
activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 were cash payments of $71.0 million related to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states.

(j)

Capital expenditures include capitalization of contract costs, capitalization of purchased and developed software and purchases of property and
equipment.

(k)

On February 1, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion of common stock repurchases through December 31, 2012, of which
$615.5 million remains available as of December 31, 2011. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we repurchased 40.3 million, 35.6 million, 24.8 million, 58.1 million and 34.7 million
shares, respectively.



(l)

During 2011, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share in each of the last three quarters and $0.07 per
common share in the first quarter. During 2010, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per common share in each of the first three quarters. During the fourth quarter of
2009, the Board of Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.06 per common share. During the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, the Board of Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.04 per common share.

(m)

Consumer-to-consumer transactions include Western Union, Vigo and Orlandi Valuta branded consumer-to-consumer money transfer services worldwide.

(n)

Global business payments transactions include the Western Union Payments service, formerly Quick Collect, Convenience Pay, Speedpay, Equity
Accelerator, Just in Time EFT, Pago Fácil, and Western Union Business Solutions. Amounts also include transactions for Custom House and TGBP since the acquisitions in September 2009 and November 2011, respectively.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to
those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Certain statements contained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical
facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking
statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-looking Statements.”

Overview

We are a leading provider of money movement services, operating in two business segments:

•

Consumer-to-consumer

— money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third-party agents using our
multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for international cross-border transfers — that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another—and, in certain countries, intra-country
transfers—that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country.

•

Global business payments

— the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business payments services
allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. Our existing Western Union Business Solutions
business (“Business Solutions”) and Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”), which was acquired in November 2011, are also included in this segment. These businesses facilitate business-to-business payments, primarily for
cross-border, cross-currency transactions. The majority of the segment’s revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented. However, international expansion and other key strategic initiatives, including TGBP, have
resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment.

Businesses not
considered part of the segments described above are categorized as “Other” and represented 2% or less of consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Significant Financial and Other Highlights

Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2011 included:

•

We generated $5,491.4 million in total consolidated revenues compared to $5,192.7 million in the prior year, representing a year-over-year
increase of 6%. The acquisition of TGBP contributed $35.2 million to revenue for 2011.

•

We incurred $46.8 million and $59.5 million of restructuring and related expenses as described within “Operating expenses overview”
in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

•

We generated $1,385.0 million in consolidated operating income compared to $1,300.1 million in the prior year, representing an increase of
7%. The results include the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above.



•

Our operating income margin was 25% during the year ended December 31, 2011, which is flat year-over-year. These results include the
restructuring and related expenses mentioned above.

•

We completed three acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2011:

•

In April 2011, we completed the acquisition of one of our largest agents, European-based Angelo Costa, S.r.l. (“Costa”), for cash
consideration of $135.7 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $29.4 million in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interest in Costa to fair value.

•

In October 2011, we completed the acquisition of one of our largest agents, European-based Finint S.r.l. (“Finint”), for cash
consideration of $139.4 million. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $20.5 million in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interest in Finint to fair value.

•

In November 2011, we completed the acquisition of the business-to-business payment business known as TGBP from Travelex Holdings Limited for cash
consideration of $967.8 million.

•

In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS Agreement”) resolving substantially all of
the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter.

•

Consolidated net income was $1,165.4 million and $909.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing
a year-over-year increase of 28%. In addition to the tax benefit described above, the results include $32.0 million and $39.3 million in restructuring and related expense, net of tax, respectively. Additionally, for 2011, we recognized gains of
$12.7 million and $18.3 million, net of tax, related to our acquisitions of Finint and Costa, respectively, and $13.5 million, net of tax, related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into to reduce the economic variability related to the
cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition.

•

Our consumers transferred $81 billion and $76 billion in consumer-to-consumer principal for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, of which $73 billion and $69 billion related to cross-border principal, which represented an increase of 7% in both consumer-to-consumer principal and cross-border principal over the prior year.

•

Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,174.9 million and $994.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2010, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 were impacted by a $250 million tax deposit we made relating to United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring,
which have been previously accrued for in our consolidated financial statements.

Our
strategic priorities for ensuring our long-term success include accelerating profitable growth in our retail channels, developing new products and services for our consumers, including expanding our electronic channel offerings to offer more choice
and gain new consumers, expanding our business-to-business payments solutions, and improving our processes and productivity to help drive growth and improve our profitability. Significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of
operations include:

•

Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction volume in our consumer-to-consumer segment is affected by,
among other things, the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a reduction in the size of the migrant population,
interruptions in migration



patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws, economic development patterns or political events, could adversely affect our
transaction volume. For discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the consumer-to-consumer segment discussion below.

•

Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers, the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set
by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. We intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account
growth opportunities and including competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins in the near term, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased
revenues over time.

•

A majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions, which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate.

•

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue. The
impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program.

Spin-off from First Data

We were incorporated in
Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as
well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders (“Spin-off”) through this previously owned subsidiary.

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Components of Revenues and Expenses

The following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in Item 8,
Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Transaction fees

—Transaction fees are charged for sending consumer-to-consumer money transfers and for global business payments services. Consumer-to-consumer transaction fees generally vary
according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent and received. Transaction fees represented 77% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Foreign exchange revenues

—In certain consumer-to-consumer money transfer and global business payments
transactions involving different currencies, we generate revenues based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. In our consumer-to-consumer business,
foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by international consumer-to-consumer cross-currency transactions. Also, as a result of the acquisitions of Custom House, Ltd. (“Custom House”) and TGBP, our foreign exchange revenues have
increased. Foreign exchange revenues represented 21% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011.



Other revenues

—Other revenues primarily consist of commissions
and fees we receive in connection with the sale of money orders, investment income primarily derived from interest generated on consumer-to-consumer money transfer, money order and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and
losses from such assets and enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator program (a recurring mortgage payment service program). Other revenues represented 2% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2011. Prior to October 1, 2009, our money orders were issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc. (“IPS”), a subsidiary of First Data, from whom we received a commission. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the
responsibility for issuing money orders and no longer receive a commission from IPS. We now recognize fees and investment income derived from interest generated on money order settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such
assets similar to our consumer-to-consumer money transfer and payment services settlement assets.

Cost of
services—

Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represent approximately 70% of total cost of services, and expenses for call centers, settlement operations, and related information technology costs. Expenses within
these functions include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services.

Selling, general and administrative

—Selling, general and administrative, or “SG&A,” primarily
consists of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses.

Interest income

—Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy
settlement obligations and in connection with loans previously made to certain existing agents.

Interest
expense

—Interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings, including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps.

Derivative gains/(losses), net

—Represents the portion of the change in fair value of foreign currency
accounting hedges that is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, which includes (a) differences between changes in forward rates and spot rates and (b) gains or losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during periods in
which the instrument is not designated as a hedge. We also include in this line item changes in the fair value of derivative contracts, consisting of forward contracts with maturities of less than one year entered into to reduce the economic
variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies. Although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive
income or loss until settlement (i.e., spot rate changes), the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur. Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to
mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our consumer-to-consumer money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in
“Selling, general and administrative expenses.” Derivative gains and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward and option contracts used in our business-to-business payments operations. The impact of these
contracts is classified within “Foreign exchange revenues” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other income, net

—Other income, net is comprised primarily of gains on revaluation of equity interests,
equity earnings from equity method investments and miscellaneous income and expenses.

Results of Operations

The following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended
December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment



results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
between our Company’s segments have been eliminated.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we
reached an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a
tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter. For additional information, refer to “Income taxes.”

We incurred expenses of $46.8 million and $59.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for restructuring and related activities, which have not been allocated to
segments. No restructuring and related expenses were recognized in the corresponding period in 2009. While these items are identifiable to our segments, they are not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities refer to “Operating expenses
overview.”

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $71.0 million settlement
accrual, which was not allocated to the segments. While this item was identifiable to our consumer-to-consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment
performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to “Selling, general and administrative” expenses.



The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Revenues overview

The majority of transaction fees
and foreign exchange revenues were contributed by our consumer-to-consumer segment for all periods presented, which is discussed in greater detail in “Segment Discussion.”

2011 compared to 2010

Consolidated revenue increased 6%
during the year ended December 31, 2011 due to consumer-to-consumer transaction growth and the weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which positively impacted revenue, offset by slight price
reductions. The weakening of the United States dollar



compared to most other foreign currencies positively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1% in the year ended December 31, 2011. The acquisition of TGBP contributed $35.2 million or 1%
of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia
(“EMEASA”) region of our consumer-to-consumer segment, which represented 43% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, experienced revenue growth primarily driven by most of the same factors described
above. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Gulf States continued to experience revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2011, which was partially offset by softness in Southern Europe and Russia and declines resulting from the
political unrest in Libya and the Ivory Coast.

The Americas region (including North America, Central America,
the Caribbean and South America) of our consumer-to-consumer segment, which represented 32% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, experienced revenue growth due to transaction growth, slightly offset by pricing
reductions.

Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the
same period in 2010 primarily due to increasing foreign exchange revenues in our consumer-to-consumer segment, driven primarily by the increased amount of cross-border principal sent. Additionally, foreign exchange revenues were positively impacted
by the acquisition of TGBP and revenue growth experienced in our existing Business Solutions business.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar
have resulted in a benefit to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $38.0 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant
currency rates. The largest benefit was related to the EMEASA region.

2010 compared to 2009

Consolidated revenue increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 due to consumer-to-consumer transaction
growth and the acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $111.0 million to revenue in 2010 and $30.8 million in 2009. Transaction growth and incremental Custom House revenue were offset by price decreases, primarily related to pricing
reductions taken in the domestic business (transactions between and within the United States and Canada) commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, declines in our United States bill payments businesses, geographic and product mix, including a higher
percentage of revenue earned from intra-country activity, which has a lower revenue per transaction, and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue.

The EMEASA region of our consumer-to-consumer segment, which represented 44% of our total consolidated revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2010, experienced flat revenue despite transaction growth. Transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar in the region compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted
revenue, and many of the same factors described above.

The Americas region of our consumer-to-consumer
segment, which represented 31% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced revenue increases due to strong transaction growth, although the increase was mostly offset by the impact of pricing actions
taken in our domestic business in the fourth quarter of 2009.

The global business payments segment, which is
discussed in greater detail in “Segment Discussion,” also experienced revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to our acquisition of Custom House, which was partially offset by declines in
our United States cash-based bill payments businesses.



Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31,
2010 over 2009 primarily due to foreign exchange revenues contributed from our acquisition of Custom House. In addition to the impact of Custom House, foreign exchange revenues in the consumer-to-consumer segment also grew, driven primarily by
revenue from the international business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate
between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction of transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $36.8 million over the previous year,
net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the EMEASA region.

Operating expenses overview

Restructuring and related activities

On May 25, 2010 and as subsequently revised, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan
(the “Restructuring Plan”) designed to reduce our overall headcount and migrate positions from various facilities, primarily within North America and Europe, to regional operating centers. As of September 30, 2011, we had incurred all
of the expenses related to this Restructuring Plan. Total expense incurred under the Restructuring Plan for the period from May 25, 2010 through December 31, 2011 was $106 million, consisting of $75 million for severance and
employee related benefits, $5 million for facility closures, including lease terminations, and $26 million for other expenses. Included in these expenses are $2 million of non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold
improvement write-offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. Total cost savings of approximately $55 million were generated in 2011. Cost savings of approximately $70 million are expected to be generated in 2012 and annually
thereafter.

For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, restructuring and related expenses of
$10.6 million and $15.0 million, respectively, are classified within “Cost of services” and $36.2 million and $44.5 million, respectively, are classified within “Selling, general and administrative” in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Cost of services

Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to agent commissions, which increase in relation to revenue increases, the weakening
of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a negative impact on the translation of our expenses, and incremental operating costs associated with TGBP, partially offset by commission savings resulting
from the acquisitions of Finint and Costa, and the lowering of certain other agent commission rates. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 56% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in cost
of services as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to commission savings resulting from the acquisitions of Finint and Costa, offset by negative currency impacts.

Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily due to incremental costs, including those related to Custom House, our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account based money transfer services; agent commissions, which primarily
increase in relation to revenue increases; and restructuring and related expenses of $15.0 million, offset by operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 57% for both years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009 as incremental operating costs, including costs associated with our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account based money transfer services, and restructuring
and related expenses were offset by operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense.



Selling, general and administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased for the year ended December 31, 2011
compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increased expenses resulting from the acquisitions of TGBP, Finint and Costa, including deal and integration costs associated with these acquisitions, investments in strategic initiatives, and the
weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a negative impact on the translation of our expenses, partially offset by restructuring savings.

SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the
settlement accrual that was recorded in 2009, as described below, lower marketing-related expenditures and operating efficiencies, offset by incremental costs associated with Custom House and our retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment
Services Directive, restructuring and related expenses of $44.5 million and higher employee compensation costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. On February 11, 2010, we signed
this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required us to fund a multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico
border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. The accrual included amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement,
we have made and expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor has been engaged for those programs. The costs of the investments in our programs and for the monitor are expected
to reach up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013.

During the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, marketing-related expenditures, principally classified within SG&A, were approximately 4.1%, 4.1%, and 4.7%, respectively, of revenue. Marketing-related expenditures include advertising, events, loyalty
programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities. When making decisions with respect to marketing investments, we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing-related expenditures together with opportunities for fee
adjustments, as discussed in “Segment Discussion,” for consumer-to-consumer revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments.

Total other expense, net

Total other expense, net
decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to the gains of $20.5 million and $29.4 million in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interests in Finint and Costa,
respectively, to fair value. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a $20.8 million net gain on foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of less than one year entered into in order to reduce the economic
variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition. These amounts were partially offset by increased interest expense in 2011 due
to our debt issuances.

Total other expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2010
compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from our $250 million note issuance and financing costs incurred in connection with our note exchange, and a decrease in interest income due to lower short-term
interest rates and the repayment of a note receivable due from an agent. These amounts were partially offset by the recovery of $6.3 million of the $12 million reserve recorded in the prior year against our receivable from the Reserve
International Liquidity Fund due to the final settlement.



Income taxes

Our effective tax rates on pre-tax income were 8.6%, 20.5% and 25.0% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations
in 2003, as described below, slightly offset by higher taxes associated with the Finint and Costa remeasurement gains. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a cumulative tax planning benefit from certain foreign
acquisitions and the settlement with the IRS of certain issues relating to the 2002-2004 tax years. We continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign-derived, and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal
and state tax rates in the United States.

In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving
substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we expect to make cash payments in 2012 of approximately $190 million, which are in addition to the $250 million
tax deposit we made with the IRS in 2010. This deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to our related tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. The $250 million refundable tax deposit is recorded as a reduction
to “Income taxes payable” in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011. Also as a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this
matter. We also expect the settlement with the IRS to result in a lower effective tax rate in future years.

We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2011,
the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $135.0 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related benefits. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review.
While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related
reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue and
(ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial
statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows.

Earnings per share

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, basic earnings per share were $1.85, $1.37 and $1.21,
respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.84, $1.36 and $1.21, respectively. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were 17.1 million, 34.0 million and 37.5 million, respectively, of
outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti-dilutive.

Of the 30.7 million, 37.5 million and 42.8 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common
stock as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, approximately 32%, 35% and 40%, respectively, were held by employees of First Data.

Earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the corresponding previous periods,
respectively, as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income, mainly from the tax related benefit discussed above, and lower weighted-average shares outstanding. Earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31,
2010 compared to the corresponding previous periods, respectively, as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income and lower weighted-average shares outstanding. The lower number of shares outstanding was due to stock
repurchases exceeding stock option exercises.



Segment Discussion

We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two
segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are consumer-to-consumer and global business payments. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as
“Other.”

The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our CODM are computed in
accordance with the following principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments’ revenue compared to total revenue.

•

Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions are included in “Other.”

•

We incurred expenses of $46.8 million and $59.5 million for restructuring and related activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively, which were not allocated to segments. No expenses were recognized for restructuring and related activities in 2009. While these items were identifiable to our segments, they were not included in the measurement of segment
operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities, refer to “Operating expenses
overview.”

•

During 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from the multi-state agreement and settlement, which was not allocated to the
segments. While this item was identifiable to our consumer-to-consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to
resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to “Operating expenses overview.”

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments.

The following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

(a)

The consumer-to-consumer geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money
transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue is attributed
to that region.



Consumer-to-Consumer Segment

The following table sets forth our consumer-to-consumer segment results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

The table below sets forth transaction and revenue growth rates by region for the years
ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

(a)

In determining the revenue and transaction growth rates under the regional view in the above table, the geographic split is determined based upon
the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with each region
receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions are attributed to that region.

When referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for individual countries in the following discussion, all transactions to, from and within those countries, and 100% of the revenue associated with
each transaction to, from and within those countries are included. The countries of India and China combined represented approximately 8%, 7% and 7% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, represented more than approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.



Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues

2011 compared to 2010

For the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, consumer-to-consumer money transfer revenue grew 5%, on transaction growth of 6%. The weakening of the United States dollar
compared to most other foreign currencies positively impacted our revenue growth by approximately 1%, which was offset by slight price reductions for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Revenue in our EMEASA region increased 4% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in
2010 due to transaction growth of 4% as well as the other factors described above. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Gulf States continued to experience revenue and transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the
prior year, which was partially offset by softness in Southern Europe and Russia and declines resulting from the political unrest in Libya and the Ivory Coast. Our money transfer business to India experienced revenue growth of 11% and transaction
growth of 10% for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the prior year.

Americas revenue increased 5%
due to transaction growth of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Our domestic business experienced revenue growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to transaction growth of 16%.
Transaction growth in our domestic business was higher than revenue growth due to transaction growth being greater in lower principal bands, which have lower revenue per transaction. Our United States outbound business experienced both transaction
and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2011. Mexico revenue increased 2% on flat transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our Mexico business is being affected by on-going changes to our compliance procedures related
to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. These changes are expected to cause our Mexico business to decline in 2012.

Revenue in our Asia Pacific (“APAC”) region increased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to transaction growth of 9% and the weakening of the
United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which positively impacted revenue. China’s revenue increased 6% for year ended December 31, 2011 on transaction growth of 4% for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 grew compared to the same period in 2010,
driven primarily by increased amounts of cross-border principal sent.

Fluctuations in the exchange rate
between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a benefit to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $39.1 million over the same period in
2010, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest benefit was related to the EMEASA region.

We have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign
exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account a variety of factors. Fee and foreign exchange reductions generally reduce revenues in the near term, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and
increased revenues over time. In certain corridors, we may also implement fee or foreign exchange spread increases. In 2011, we adjusted our reporting of the net impact of price reductions. We now calculate the impact of price reductions against
prior year transaction volumes, rather than current year transaction volumes. We believe utilizing prior year transaction volumes more appropriately differentiates between the impacts of price reductions versus other items impacting revenue. Under
the new methodology, the fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately 1% of total Western Union revenue for the full year 2011 compared to approximately 3% for the full year 2010, as fee reductions were slightly lower and there is
some offset by modest increases in foreign currency spreads in some corridors. Under the previous methodology, we reported that the impact of price reductions in 2010 was 4%.



The majority of transaction growth is derived from more
mature agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation. Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location, is often experienced as locations mature. We believe
that new agent locations will help our growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being initiated (versus paid) as “send locations”
and to the balance of locations as “receive locations.” Send locations are the engine that drives consumer-to-consumer revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than receive locations. However, a wide network of receive
locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers. The number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics
around the location, migration patterns, the location’s class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and competition. Each of the more than 485,000 agent locations in our
agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services; however, not every location completes a transaction in a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2011, more than 85% of agent locations in the United States, Canada and
Western Europe (representing at least one of our three money transfer brands: Western Union

®

, Orlandi
Valuta

(

SM

)

and Vigo

®

) experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations,
approximately 65% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. We periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions.

2010 compared to 2009

For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year, consumer-to-consumer money transfer revenue grew 2% primarily due to transaction growth of 9%. Transaction growth was offset by price
decreases, primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, geographic and product mix, including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra-country activity, and the
strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue by approximately 1%. Our international consumer-to-consumer business experienced revenue growth of 3% on transaction growth of 8%
for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the United States and Canada and transactions to and from Mexico. Our international consumer-to-consumer
business outside of the United States also experienced revenue growth on transaction increases for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Revenue in our EMEASA region remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year despite transaction growth of 5%. Transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of
the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies in the region and many of the same factors described above. Our European market experienced transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior
year. In addition, for the full year ended December 31, 2010, revenue and transactions in the Gulf States declined moderately compared to the same period in 2009, however, both revenue and transactions grew in the fourth quarter of 2010
compared to the comparable period in the prior year. India had transaction growth of 4% and revenue growth of 5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the same period in 2009.

Americas revenue increased 2% on transaction growth of 11% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the
prior year due to the pricing actions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our domestic business experienced revenue declines of 6% on transaction growth of 28% for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the
same factors. However, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our domestic business experienced revenue growth of 7% on transaction growth of 29% as we reached the anniversary of the pricing reductions taken in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our United States
outbound business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2010. Our Mexico business revenue was flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 on transaction growth of 2%.



APAC revenue increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2010
compared to the prior year due to transaction growth of 14%. China’s revenue increased 10% on transaction growth of 7% for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 grew compared to the prior year, driven primarily by
revenue from our international consumer-to-consumer business outside of the United States.

Fluctuations in
the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $32.3 million over
the same period in the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the EMEASA region.

Operating income

2011 compared to 2010

Consumer-to-consumer operating income increased 6% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same
period in 2010 due to revenue growth. The change in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily due to restructuring savings and revenue leverage, partially offset by negative
currency impacts, including the effect of foreign currency hedges, and spending on initiatives.

2010 compared to 2009

Consumer-to-consumer operating income increased 6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared
to the same period in 2009 due to lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense, offset by higher employee compensation costs and incremental costs associated with our retail expansion in Europe pursuant
to the Payment Services Directive. The increase in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from these same factors.

Global Business Payments Segment

The following table sets forth our global business payments segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Calculation not meaningful



Revenues

2011 compared to 2010

During the year ended
December 31, 2011, global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our acquisition of TGBP, which contributed $35.2 million of revenue, primarily included in foreign exchange revenues, and revenue growth in international
bill payments, Business Solutions, and United States electronic bill payments, partially offset by a decline in United States cash-based bill payments.

Transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was due to growth in our international bill payments and United States electronic bill payments
businesses.

2010 compared to 2009

During the year ended December 31, 2010, global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our
acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $111.0 million of revenue in 2010 versus $30.8 million in 2009, primarily included in foreign exchange revenues, and growth in the Pago Fácil business. These increases were offset by
revenue declines in our United States cash-based bill payments businesses as many United States consumers who would use our services continued to have difficulty paying their bills and continue to be unable to obtain credit in any form, resulting in
us handling fewer bill payments. The ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments in the United States and competitive pressures, which resulted in lower cash and electronic volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products, also
contributed to the revenue declines.

The transaction declines during the year ended December 31, 2010
compared to the same period in 2009 were due to declines in our United States bill payments businesses.

Operating income

2011 compared to 2010

For the year ended December 31, 2011, operating income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue increases, a decrease in integration expenses related to the acquisition of Custom
House, decreased debit card bank fees due to the recent Durbin legislation, and restructuring savings, partially offset by declines in our United States cash-based bill payments business, which has a higher margin than other payment services in the
segment, and integration and amortization expenses related to the acquisition of TGBP.

The changes in
operating income margins in the segment are due to the same factors mentioned above.

2010 compared to 2009

For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily due to declines related to the United States cash-based bill payments business, and investing and operating costs, including amortization expense, associated with the acquisition of Custom House.

The decline in operating income margin in the segment is primarily due to the increased costs associated with the
acquisition of Custom House and declines in our United States cash-based bill payments business.



Other

The following table sets forth other results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

*

Calculation not meaningful

Revenues

2011 compared to 2010

Revenue grew for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year primarily due to volume increases in
our prepaid business.

2010 compared to 2009

Revenue, generated primarily from our money order services business, declined for the year ended December 31, 2010
compared to the same period in the prior year. We experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of 5.5% from IPS on outstanding money order balances as we
did for the first three quarters of 2009. We now derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities. These securities
generally have a lower rate of return than we were receiving under our previous agreement with IPS.

Operating (loss)/income

2011 compared to 2010

During the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in operating loss was primarily due to deal costs associated with the TGBP acquisition.

2010 compared to 2009

During the year ended
December 31, 2010, the decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in revenue from our money order services business, as described above, and an increase in promotional marketing activities related to our prepaid business in the United
States. In 2009, we also incurred additional costs associated with evaluating and closing acquisitions compared to 2010.

Further financial information relating to each of our segments’ external revenue, operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.



2012 Changes in Reportable Segments

In connection with the acquisition of TGBP, recent management changes, and other key strategic initiatives, we will
implement a new segment structure to assess performance and allocate resources, beginning in the first quarter of 2012. The changes in our segment structure primarily relate to the separation of the Global Business Payments segment into two new
reportable segments, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions. A summary of how the segments will be structured follows:

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and
fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings, timing of income tax payments, including our tax deposit described further in “Cash Flows from Operating
Activities,” and collections on receivables, among other items. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters
and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters.

Our future cash flows could be impacted by a
variety of factors, some of which are out of our control, including changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant population and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of
outstanding tax matters.

A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated
from subsidiaries, some of which are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions. Assets subject to legal or
regulatory restrictions, totaling approximately $230 million as of December 31, 2011, include assets outside of the United States subject to restrictions from being transferred outside of the countries where they are located. We are also
required to maintain cash and investment balances in our regulated subsidiaries related to certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations. Significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary
source of liquidity.

We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including
approximately $190 million of tax payments we expect to make in 2012 as a result of the IRS Agreement, dividends and share repurchases, through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations. As of
December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $1.65 billion revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and had $297.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which left $1,353.0 million
remaining that was available to borrow on the Revolving Credit Facility.



Cash and Investment Securities

As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion, of which $476 million was held
by our foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash balances to fluctuate.

Repatriating foreign funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our
combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally.

In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of
those transactions. These funds, referred to as “Settlement assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement
assets in highly liquid investments, classified as “Cash and cash equivalents” within “Settlement assets,” to fund settlement obligations.

Investment securities, classified within “Settlement assets,” were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. Substantially all of these investments are highly-rated state and municipal
debt securities. Most state regulators in the United States require us to maintain specific highly-rated, investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with
applicable regulations.

Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and
credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, the majority of our investment securities had credit
ratings of “AA–” or better from a major credit rating agency. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2011, all investments with a single issuer and each individual
security was less than 10% of our investment securities portfolio.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $1,174.9 million,
$994.4 million and $1,218.1 million, respectively. In the first quarter of 2010, we made a $250.0 million tax deposit relating to United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international
restructuring, which have been previously accrued in our consolidated financial statements. Making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit.



Financing Resources

As of December 31, 2011, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions):

(a)

We utilize interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of our notes from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to manage our overall exposure to interest rates. The changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps result in an offsetting hedge accounting adjustment recorded to
the carrying value of the related note. These hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to or increases in “Interest expense” over the life of the related notes and cause the effective rate of interest to differ from
the notes’ stated rate.

(b)

On March 7, 2011, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due March 7, 2013
(“2013 Notes”). Interest is payable quarterly at a per annum interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 58 basis points (1.11% as of December 31, 2011) and is reset quarterly. See below for additional detail relating to the debt
issuance.

(c)

The difference between the stated interest rate and the effective interest rate is not significant.

(d)

On August 22, 2011, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 3.650% unsecured fixed rate notes due 2018 (“2018
Notes”). In anticipation of this issuance, we entered into interest rate lock contracts to fix the interest rate of the debt issuance, and recorded a loss on the contracts of $21.6 million, which increased the effective rate to 4.4%, in
“Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” which will be amortized into “Interest expense” over the life of the 2018 Notes. See below for additional detail relating to the debt issuance.

(e)

As of December 31, 2011, our weighted-average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 4.8%.

Commercial Paper Program

Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings
outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance.



Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2011 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of
approximately 0.6% and a weighted-average term of 9 days. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $89.7 million and the maximum balance outstanding was $784.1 million. Proceeds from our
commercial paper borrowings were used for general liquidity. We had $297.0 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011.

Revolving Credit Facility

On September 23, 2011, we
entered into a credit agreement which expires January 2017 providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of $1.65 billion, including a $250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub-facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility replaced our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that was set to expire in September 2012.

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR
rate plus an interest rate margin of 90 basis points. A facility fee of 10 basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our
credit ratings.

The purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 17
participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short-term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed
balance of $1.65 billion is approximately 12%. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, we had $297.0 million of
commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which left $1,353.0 million remaining that was available to borrow on the Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving
Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted.

Notes

On August 22, 2011, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes
due August 22, 2018 for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt. Interest with respect to the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 22 and August 22 each year based on the fixed per annum interest
rate of 3.650%. We may redeem the 2018 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 35 basis points.

On March 7, 2011, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due
March 7, 2013 for general corporate purposes. Interest with respect to the 2013 Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on each March 7, June 7, September 7 and December 7, beginning June 7, 2011, at a per annum interest
rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 58 basis points (reset quarterly).

On June 21, 2010, we
issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 (“2040 Notes”). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the
fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.

On March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due
November 17, 2011 (“2011 Notes”) for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”). Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per
annum



interest rate of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal.
As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be accreted into “Interest expense” over the life of
the notes. We may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points.

On February 26, 2009, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due
February 26, 2014 (“2014 Notes”). Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually on February 26 and August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.500%. We may redeem the 2014 Notes at
any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points.

On November 17, 2006, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2036 (“2036 Notes”). Interest with respect to the 2036 Notes
is payable semi-annually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury
rate plus 25 basis points.

On September 29, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion of aggregate
principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016 (“2016 Notes”). Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 5.930%. We
may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points.

Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants

The credit
ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business, managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include
earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and the overall business.

Our Revolving Credit
Facility contains an interest rate margin and facility fee which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, we are subject to certain provisions in our 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2040 Notes and certain of our
derivative contracts which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are
tied to changes in our credit ratings. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2011:

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Our
credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade or a negative outlook provided by the rating agencies could result in the following:

•

Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the commercial paper
market would likely be eliminated;



•

We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings;

•

Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease;

•

Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries
to pay dividends; and

•

Our business relationships may be adversely impacted.

Consistent with the prior facility, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things,
limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into
sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2016 Notes, 2020 Notes and the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or
restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. Also consistent with the prior facility, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to
maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum of (a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation expense,
(d) amortization expense, (e) any other non-cash deductions, losses or changes made in determining net income for such period and (f) extraordinary losses or charges, minus extraordinary gains, in each case determined in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 9:1 for the
year ended December 31, 2011.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with our
debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes.

Cash Priorities

Liquidity

Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with our current credit
ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business.

Capital Expenditures

The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment and purchased and developed software was $162.5 million, $113.7 million and $98.9 million in 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during 2011, 2010 and 2009
included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software.

Acquisition of Businesses

On November 7, 2011, we acquired TGBP from Travelex Holdings Limited for cash consideration of
£603 million ($967.8 million), which included acquired cash of $40.0 million and an initial working capital adjustment. The final consideration is subject to an additional working capital adjustment.

On October 31, 2011, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in Finint, one of our largest money transfer agents in
Europe, for cash consideration of €99.6 million ($139.4 million). We previously held a 30% equity interest in Finint.



On April 20, 2011, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in Costa, one
of our largest money transfer agents in Europe, for cash consideration of €95 million ($135.7 million), which included a reduction of €5 million ($7.1 million) for an initial working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of
the purchase agreement. The final consideration is subject to an additional working capital adjustment. We previously held a 30% equity interest in Costa.

On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada-based Custom House, a provider of international business-to-business payment services, for cash consideration of $371.0 million for all of the common
shares of this business and acquired cash of $2.5 million.

On February 24, 2009, we acquired the
money transfer business of European-based FEXCO Group Holdings (“FEXCO Group”), one of our largest agents providing services in a number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Ireland. We surrendered our
24.65% interest in FEXCO Group and paid €123.1 million ($157.4 million) as consideration for all of the common shares of the money transfer business and acquired cash of $11.8 million.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, 40.3 million, 35.6 million and 24.8 million, respectively, of shares were repurchased for $800.0 million, $584.5 million
and $400.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $19.83, $16.44 and $16.10 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, $615.5 million remains available under share repurchase authorizations approved
by our Board of Directors through December 31, 2012.

On February 7, 2012, our Board of Directors
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on March 30, 2012. During 2011, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share in each of the last three quarters and $0.07 per common share in
the first quarter representing $194.2 million in total dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per common share
in each of the first three quarters representing $165.3 million in total dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share representing $41.2 million in total dividends.
These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective month the dividend was declared, except for the September 2011 and 2010 declared dividends, which were paid in October 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Debt Service Requirements

Our 2012 debt service requirements will include payments on existing borrowings and any future borrowings under our commercial paper program and interest payments on all outstanding indebtedness. We have
the ability to use existing financing sources, including our Revolving Credit Facility or commercial paper program, and cash generated from operations to meet our debt obligations as they come due.

Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including share
repurchases and dividends, and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain
adequate financing and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in Note 12 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources.



Pension Plan

Our defined benefit pension plan had recorded unfunded pension obligations of $112.7 million and $112.8 million as
of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we made contributions of approximately $25 million to the Plan, including discretionary contributions of $3 million and $10 million,
respectively. Due to the closure of one of our facilities in Missouri and an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, we funded $4.1 million during 2009. We will be required to fund approximately $20 million to the Plan in
2012 and may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $5 million.

Our most recent
measurement date for our pension plan was December 31, 2011. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions: 1) expected long-term return on plan assets; and 2) discount
rate.

We employ a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and long-term historical risk, return, and co-variance relationships between equities, fixed income securities, and alternative investments are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle
that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to
diversification, re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical returns are reviewed within the context of current economic conditions to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate against
a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five-year period. Our expected long-term return on plan assets was 7.00% for 2011 and 6.50% for 2010. The expected long-term
return on plan assets is 7.00% for 2012. As of December 31, 2011, pension plan target allocations were approximately 15% in equity investments, 60% in debt securities and 25% in alternative investment strategies (e.g. hedge funds, royalty
rights and private equity funds). Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to: commodities/currencies, equity long-short, relative value, multi-strategy, event driven, and global-macro. The Plan holds derivative contracts directly
which consist of standardized obligations to buy or sell United States treasury bonds or notes at predetermined future dates and prices which are transacted on regulated exchanges. Additionally, derivatives are held indirectly through funds in
which the Plan is invested. Derivatives are used by the Plan to help reduce the Plan’s exposure to interest rate volatility and to provide an additional source of return. Cash held by the Plan is used to satisfy margin requirements on
the derivatives. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.

The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The
discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit
obligation was 3.72% and 4.69% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2011 and the effect
such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):

(a)

We have estimated our interest payments based on (i) commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and the assumption
that these commercial paper borrowings will be repaid upon maturity and that no new issuances will occur in 2012, (ii) the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes, and (iii) an estimate
of future interest rates on our floating rate debt and interest rate swap agreements based on projected LIBOR rates.

(b)

In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international
operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we expect to make cash payments to the IRS and various state tax authorities in 2012 totaling approximately $190 million to cover the remaining portion of the additional tax and interest.

(c)

We have estimated our pension plan funding requirements, including interest, using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding
rates. The unfunded pension liability included in “Other liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the present value of the estimated pension plan funding requirements disclosed above. The actual minimum required amounts each year
will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated. In addition, we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $5 million to the plan in 2012, which has not been reflected in
the table above.

(d)

Unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties. The timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities
is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control.

(e)

Represents the liability position of our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011, which will fluctuate
based on market conditions.

(f)

This line item relates to accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of December 31, 2011.

(g)

Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a terminations penalty. Termination penalties are
generally an amount less than the original obligation.



Obligations under certain contracts are usage-based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or
incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations.

(h)

This line item includes certain additional investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border, which are expected to
cost up to $19 million over the next two years pursuant to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. This line item also includes the pending acquisition of the French assets of TGBP. Due to pending regulatory
matters, this acquisition for cash consideration of £3 million (approximately $4.7 million based on currency exchange rates at December 31, 2011) has not been finalized as of December 31, 2011. This acquisition is expected to
close in 2012, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of closing conditions.

Other Commercial Commitments

We had approximately $120 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of
December 31, 2011, with expiration dates through 2015, the majority of which contain a one-year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. We
expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is
based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed
in Note 2,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.



Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and
estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition.













ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We provide
consumer-to-consumer money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the vast majority of our agents in
United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to
obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into
short-term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts,
typically with terms of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany loans. In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments
transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the



difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. We
promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies.

We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consumer-to-consumer revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and
to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies. We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on forecasted
revenues, with a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year. We believe the use of longer-term foreign currency forward contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our international consumer-to-consumer operations.

We have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management due to the nature of
our Western Union Business Solutions (“Business Solutions”) business, which includes our Travelex Global Business Payments business (“TGBP”), which was acquired in November 2011. The significant majority of this business’
revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency payments. In certain countries, this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments.
The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. Business Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting
net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. The foreign exchange risk is actively managed.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, a hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are generated
would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre-tax annual income of approximately $33 million and $32 million, respectively, based on our forecast of consumer-to-consumer unhedged exposure to foreign currency at those dates. There are
inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static, and that we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a
result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income.

Interest Rates

We invest in several types of
interest-bearing assets, with a total value as of December 31, 2011 of $2.7 billion. Approximately $1.8 billion of these assets bear interest at floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. These assets
primarily include money market funds and state and municipal variable rate securities and are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Settlement assets.” To the extent these assets are
held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as “Settlement assets.” Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short-term
interest rates.

Substantially all of the remainder of our interest-bearing assets consist of highly-rated
state and municipal debt securities, the majority of which are fixed-rate instruments. These investments may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment services awaiting redemption
classified within “Settlement assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed-rate interest-bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an
increase to the fair values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available-for-sale within “Settlement assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair value with
the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our “Total stockholders’ equity” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.



As of December 31, 2011, we had $300.0 million of floating notes, which
had an effective interest rate of 1.11% or 58 basis points above three-month LIBOR. Additionally, $500.0 million of our total $3.6 billion of fixed-rate borrowings at par value are effectively floating rate debt through interest rate swap
agreements, changing this fixed-rate debt to LIBOR-based floating rate debt, with weighted-average spreads of approximately 600 basis points above LIBOR. Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a short period that the financing
is effectively floating rate. Commercial paper borrowings of $297.0 million were outstanding as of the year ended December 31, 2011. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2011 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of
approximately 0.6% and a weighted-average term of 9 days. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $89.7 million and the maximum balance outstanding was $784.1 million.

We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each,
also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of
our interest-bearing assets as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus
floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. As of December 31, 2011, our weighted-average effective rate was approximately 4.8%.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre-tax
income of approximately $11 million and $12 million annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest
rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on December 31, 2011 and 2010 that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting benefit/reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $18 million and
$25 million annually, respectively. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the
potential effects of more complex market changes, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the
level of assets and liabilities will change over time. We will also be further impacted by changes to future interest rates as we refinance our debt or by reinvesting proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments.

Credit Risk

Our interest earning assets include investment securities, substantially all of which are highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, which are classified in “Settlement assets” and
accounted for as available-for-sale securities, and money market fund investments, which are classified in “Cash and cash equivalents.” The majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of “AA–” or better from a
major credit rating agency.

To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities,
money market investments, derivatives and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we
attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions. We also limit our investment level in any individual money market fund to no more than $100 million.

We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk-in bill payment
and money order settlement process. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our Internet services and electronic channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash,
and therefore are subject to “chargebacks,” insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud. We perform a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic analyses.



We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating
to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) receivables from certain customers for which beneficiaries are paid prior to receiving cleared funds from the customer (known as “early release”). For the derivatives,
the duration of these contracts is generally nine months or less. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their
obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. For early release customers, collection ordinarily occurs within a few days. To mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis, and,
for our derivatives, we may require certain customers to post collateral or increase collateral based on the fair value of the customer’s contract and their risk profile.

Our losses associated with bad debts have been less than 1% of our revenues in all periods presented.



ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

Index To Consolidated Financial Statements

All other financial statement schedules for The Western Union Company have been omitted
since the required information is not present or not present in amounts sufficient to require submission of the schedule, or because the information required is included in the respective consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.



Management’s Report on the Financial Statements

Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and the related financial information. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and necessarily include certain amounts
that are based on estimates and informed judgments. Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.

As stated in their report included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the consolidated
financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who conducted their audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. The independent registered public accounting firm’s responsibility is to express an opinion as to the fairness, in all material
respects, with which such financial statements present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Western Union Company’s (“Western Union” or the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Western Union’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
management and Board of Directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of Western Union’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company completed its acquisition of
Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”) effective November 7, 2011. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management’s assessment did not include the internal control of the acquired operations of TGBP, which
are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and for the period from November 7, 2011 through December 31, 2011. The assets of TGBP, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, net,
constituted approximately 3% of the Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2011, and TGBP revenues constituted approximately 0.6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. Based on the results of its evaluation,
which excluded an assessment of the internal control of TGBP, the Company’s management concluded that as of December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Western Union’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Western Union’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union Company

We have audited The Western Union Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Western Union Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Travelex Global Business Payments, which was acquired November 7, 2011 and is included in the consolidated financial
statements of The Western Union Company as of December 31, 2011 and for the period from November 7, 2011 through December 31, 2011. The assets of Travelex Global Business Payments, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, net,
constituted approximately 3% of The Western Union Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2011, and Travelex Global Business Payments revenues constituted approximately 0.6% of The Western Union Company’s total revenues for the year
then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of The Western Union Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Travelex Global Business Payments.

In our opinion, The Western Union Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of The Western Union Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’
equity/(deficiency) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Formation of the Entity and Basis of Presentation

The Western Union Company (“Western Union” or the “Company”)
is a leader in global money movement and payment services, providing people and businesses with fast, reliable and convenient ways to send money and make payments around the world. The Western Union

®

brand is globally recognized. The Company’s services are available through a network of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories. Each location
in the Company’s agent network is capable of providing one or more of the Company’s services.

The
Western Union business consists of the following segments:

•

Consumer-to-consumer — money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third-party agents using the
Company’s multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for international cross-border transfers — that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another—and, in certain countries,
intra-country transfers — that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country.

•

Global business payments — the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. The Company’s business payments
services allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. The Company’s existing Western Union
Business Solutions business (“Business Solutions”) and Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”), which was acquired in November 2011 (see Note 3), are also included in this segment. These businesses facilitate
business-to-business payments, primarily for cross-border, cross-currency transactions. The majority of the segment’s revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented. However, international expansion and other key
strategic initiatives, including TGBP, have resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment.

All businesses that have not been classified into the consumer-to-consumer or global business payments segments are reported as “Other” and primarily include the Company’s money order and
prepaid services business. Prior to October 1, 2009, the Company’s money orders were issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc. (“IPS”), a subsidiary of First Data Corporation (“First Data”), to consumers at retail
locations primarily in the United States and Canada. Effective October 1, 2009, the Company assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders.

There are legal or regulatory limitations on transferring certain assets of the Company outside of the countries where these assets are located, or which constitute undistributed earnings of affiliates of
the Company accounted for under the equity method of accounting. However, there are generally no limitations on the use of these assets within those countries. Additionally, the Company must meet minimum capital requirements in some countries in
order to maintain operating licenses. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of net assets subject to these limitations totaled approximately $230 million.

Various aspects of the Company’s services and businesses are subject to United States federal, state and local
regulation, as well as regulation by foreign jurisdictions, including certain banking and other financial services regulations.

Spin-off from First Data

On January 26, 2006, the First Data Board of Directors announced its intention to pursue the distribution of all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western
Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax-free distribution to First Data shareholders



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(the “Spin-off”). Effective on September 29, 2006, First Data completed the separation and the distribution of these businesses by distributing The Western Union Company common
stock to First Data shareholders (the “Distribution”). Prior to the Distribution, the Company had been a segment of First Data.

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Consistent with industry practice, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are unclassified due to the short-term nature of the Company’s settlement obligations contrasted with the
Company’s ability to invest cash awaiting settlement in long-term investment securities.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company consolidates financial results when it has both the power to direct the activities of an entity that most
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the ability to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company utilizes the equity method of accounting
when it is able to exercise significant influence over the entity’s operations, which generally occurs when the Company has an ownership interest of between 20% and 50% in an entity.

Earnings Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding
stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise price of stock options, the unamortized compensation expense
and assumed tax benefits of options and restricted stock are available to acquire shares at an average market price throughout the year, and therefore, reduce the dilutive effect.

As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were 17.1 million, 34.0 million and
37.5 million, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as their effect was anti-dilutive.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table provides the calculation of diluted weighted-average
shares outstanding (in millions):

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair values of its assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
accordance with the hierarchy described below. The fair values of the assets and liabilities held in the Company’s defined benefit plan trust (“Trust”) are recognized or disclosed utilizing the same hierarchy. The following three
levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:

•

Level 1:

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. For most of these assets, the Company utilizes pricing services that use
multiple prices as inputs to determine daily market values. In addition, the Trust has other investments that fall within Level 2 that are valued at net asset value which is not quoted on an active market; however, the unit price is based on
underlying investments which are traded on an active market.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include items where the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The Company has Level 3 assets that are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a
non-recurring basis related to the Company’s business combinations, where the values of the intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a purchase are derived utilizing one of the three recognized approaches: the market approach, the income
approach or the cost approach.

Carrying amounts for many of the Company’s financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivables, settlement obligations, borrowings under the commercial paper program and other short-term notes payable, approximate fair value due to
their short maturities. Investment securities, included in settlement assets, and derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and included in Note 8. Fixed rate notes are carried at their original issuance values as adjusted over
time to accrete that value to par, except for portions of notes hedged by interest rate swap agreements as disclosed in Note 14. The fair values of fixed rate notes are also disclosed in Note 15 and are based on market quotations. For more
information on the fair value of financial instruments, see Note 8.

The fair values of non-financial
assets and liabilities related to the Company’s business combinations are disclosed in Note 3. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities related to the Trust are disclosed in Note 11.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for all business combinations where control over another entity is obtained using the acquisition
method of accounting, which requires that most assets (both tangible and intangible), liabilities (including contingent consideration), and remaining noncontrolling interests be recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of assets less liabilities and noncontrolling interests is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets, liabilities, or noncontrolling interests made subsequent to the
acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is one year or less, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Any cost or equity method interest that the Company
holds in the acquired company prior to the acquisition is remeasured to fair value at acquisition with a resulting gain or loss recognized in income for the difference between fair value and existing book value. Results of operations of the acquired
company are included in the Company’s results from the date of the acquisition forward and include amortization expense arising from acquired intangible assets. The Company expenses all costs as incurred related to or involved with an
acquisition in “Selling, general and administrative” expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments (other than those included in settlement assets) with maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase (that are readily convertible to cash) are considered to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market value.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with various financial institutions, including a substantial portion in money market funds. The Company limits the concentration of its cash and
cash equivalents with any one institution. The Company regularly reviews investment concentrations and credit worthiness of these institutions, and has relationships with a globally diversified list of banks and financial institutions.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the related receivable balance will not
be collected based on its history of collection experience, known collection issues, such as agent suspensions and bankruptcies, and other matters the Company identifies in its routine collection monitoring. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
$28.5 million and $21.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and is recorded in the same Consolidated Balance Sheet caption as the related receivable. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the
provision for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $24.3 million, $19.1 million and $36.2 million, respectively.

Settlement Assets and Obligations

Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received from agents for unsettled money transfers, money orders and
consumer payments. The Company records corresponding settlement obligations relating to amounts payable under money transfers, money orders and consumer payment service arrangements. Settlement assets and obligations also include amounts receivable
from and payable to businesses for the value of customer cross-currency payment transactions related to the global business payments segment.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Settlement assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables from
selling agents and business-to-business customers, and investment securities. Cash received by Western Union agents generally becomes available to the Company within one week after initial receipt by the agent. Cash equivalents consist of short-term
time deposits, commercial paper and other highly liquid investments. Receivables from selling agents represent funds collected by such agents, but in transit to the Company. Western Union has a large and diverse agent base, thereby reducing the
credit risk of the Company from any one agent. In addition, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its agents’ financial condition and credit worthiness. See Note 7 for information concerning the Company’s investment
securities.

Receivables from business-to-business customers arise from cross-currency payment transactions in
the global business payments segment. Receivables occur when funds have been paid out to a beneficiary but not yet received from the customer. The credit risk associated with the receivables from these spot foreign currency exchange contracts is
largely mitigated, as in most cases the Company requires the receipt of funds from customers before releasing the associated cross-currency payment.

Settlement obligations consist of money transfer, money order and payment service payables and payables to agents. Money transfer payables represent amounts to be paid to transferees when they request
their funds. Money order payables represent amounts not yet presented for payment. Most agents typically settle with transferees first and then obtain reimbursement from the Company. Payment service payables represent amounts to be paid to utility
companies, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and others. Due to the agent funding and settlement process, payables to agents represent amounts due to agents for money transfers that have
been settled with transferees.

Settlement assets and obligations consisted of the following (in millions):

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
estimated life of the related assets (generally three to 10 years for equipment, furniture and fixtures, and 30 years for buildings) or the lease term. Maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets,
are charged to expense as incurred.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Property and equipment consisted of the following (in millions):

Amounts charged to expense for depreciation of property and equipment were $61.0 million,
$61.5 million and $55.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Deferred Customer Set Up Costs

The Company capitalizes direct incremental costs not to exceed related deferred revenues associated with the enrollment
of customers in the Equity Accelerator program, a service that allows consumers to make mortgage payments based on a customized payment program. Deferred customer set up costs, included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
are amortized to “Cost of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the length of the customer’s expected participation in the program, generally five to seven years. Actual customer attrition data is assessed at least
annually and the amortization period is adjusted prospectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired,
less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations. The Company’s annual impairment assessment did not identify any goodwill impairment during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets primarily consist of acquired
contracts, contract costs (primarily amounts paid to agents in connection with establishing and renewing long-term contracts) and software. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract or benefit
periods. Included in the Consolidated Statements of Income is amortization expense of approximately $131.6 million, $114.4 million and $98.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Acquired contracts include customer and contractual relationships and networks of subagents that are recognized in
connection with the Company’s acquisitions.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company capitalizes initial payments for new and renewed agent
contracts to the extent recoverable through future operations or penalties in the case of early termination. The Company’s accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated future
cash flows from the contract or the termination fees the Company would receive in the event of early termination of the contract.

The Company develops software that is used in providing services. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of the software has been established. Costs incurred prior to
establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established when the Company has completed all planning and designing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its
design specifications, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general use. Software development costs and purchased software are generally amortized over
a term of three to five years.

The following table provides the components of other intangible assets (in
millions):

(a)

Total other intangible assets includes $299.7 million of identifiable intangible assets related to the preliminary allocation of purchase price
for the TGBP acquisition (see Note 3).

The estimated future aggregate amortization expense for existing other intangible assets as of
December 31, 2011 is expected to be $160.6 million in 2012, $131.0 million in 2013, $107.3 million in 2014, $89.1 million in 2015, $70.7 million in 2016 and $288.7 million thereafter.

Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events indicate that their carrying
amount may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their carrying values to determine if a write-down to fair value (normally measured by the present value
technique) is required. The Company did not record any impairment related to other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2009, and recorded impairments of approximately $9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from consumer money transfer transaction fees that are based on the
principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which funds are transferred. The Company also offers several global business payments services, including payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. Transaction
fees are set by the Company and recorded as revenue at the time of sale.

In certain consumer money transfer
and global business payments transactions involving different currencies, the Company generates revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by the Company to the customer and the rate at which the Company or its agents are able to
acquire currency. This foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the related consumer money transfer transaction fee revenue is recognized or at the time a customer initiates a transaction through the Company’s business-to-business
payment service operations.

The Company’s Equity Accelerator service generally requires a consumer to
pay an upfront enrollment fee to participate in this mortgage payment service. These enrollment fees are deferred and recognized into income over the length of the customer’s expected participation in the program, generally five to seven years.
Actual customer attrition data is assessed at least annually and the period over which revenue is recognized is adjusted prospectively. Many factors impact the duration of the expected customer relationship, including interest rates, refinance
activity and trends in consumer behavior.

Cost of Services

Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions and expenses for call centers, settlement operations and related
information technology costs. Expenses within these functions include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation, amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment
services.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred or at the time the advertising first takes place.
Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $174.8 million, $163.9 million and $201.4 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities
be determined based on the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the
technical merits of the position, the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are
measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

The United States dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company’s businesses. Revenues and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for those entities for which the local currency is the functional currency are translated into United States dollars
based on exchange rates at the end of the period. The effects of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of assets and liabilities of these entities are included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive
loss.” Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of operations in which the United States dollar is the functional currency are remeasured based on exchange rates at the end of the period and are recognized in operations.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities of these operations are remeasured at historical rates in effect when the asset was recognized or the liability was incurred.

Derivatives

The Company utilizes derivatives to (a) minimize its exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency business-to-business payments by writing derivatives to customers. The Company recognizes all derivatives in the “Other assets” and “Other liabilities” captions in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. All cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, except for cash flows associated with foreign
currency forward contracts entered into in order to reduce the economic variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, which are recorded in investing
activities.

•

Cash Flow hedges—Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in “Accumulated
other comprehensive loss.” Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss” are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings. The portions of the change in fair value that are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in
“Derivative gains/(losses), net.”

•

Fair Value hedges—Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt are recorded in
“Interest expense.” The offsetting change in value of the related debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate is also recorded in “Interest expense.”

•

Undesignated—Derivative contracts entered into to reduce the variability related to (a) money transfer settlement assets and obligations,
generally with maturities of a few days up to one month, and (b) certain money transfer related foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany loans, generally with maturities of less than one year, are not designated as hedges
for accounting purposes and changes in their fair value are included in “Selling, general and administrative.” In addition, changes in fair value of derivative contracts, consisting of forward contracts with maturities of less than one
year entered into to reduce the economic variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, are recorded in “Derivative gains/(losses), net.” The Company
is also exposed to risk from derivative contracts written to its customers arising from its cross-currency business-to-business payments operations. These contracts have durations generally of nine months or less. The Company aggregates its foreign
exchange exposures in its cross-currency business-to-business payments operations, including the exposure generated by the derivative contracts it



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

writes to its customers, and typically hedges the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties (economic hedge contract) as part of a broader
foreign currency portfolio, including significant spot exchanges of currency in addition to forwards and options. The changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in “Foreign exchange revenues.”

The fair value of the Company’s derivatives is derived from standardized models that
use market based inputs (e.g., forward prices for foreign currency).

The details of each designated hedging
relationship are formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how
ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently has a stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of Western Union stock options,
restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees who perform services for the Company. In addition, the Company has a stock-based compensation plan that provides for grants of Western Union stock options and stock unit awards to
non-employee directors of the Company. Prior to the Spin-off, employees of Western Union participated in First Data’s stock-based compensation plans.

All stock-based compensation to employees is required to be measured at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period and also requires an estimate of forfeitures when calculating compensation
expense. The Company recognizes compensation expense on awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Refer to Note 16 for additional discussion regarding details of the Company’s stock-based
compensation plans.

Restructuring and Related Expenses

The Company records severance-related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable accounting guidance for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement. One-time, involuntary benefit arrangements and other exit costs are generally recognized when the liability is
incurred. Expenses arising under the Company’s defined benefit pension plans from curtailing future service of employees participating in the plans and providing enhanced benefits are recognized in earnings when it is probable and reasonably
estimable. The Company also evaluates impairment issues associated with restructuring activities when the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance. Restructuring and related
expenses consist of direct and incremental expenses associated with restructuring and related activities, including severance, outplacement and other employee related benefits; facility closure and migration of the Company’s IT infrastructure;
and other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses
are non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. For more information on the Company’s restructuring and related expenses, see Note 4.

3. Acquisitions

2011 Acquisitions

On November 7, 2011, the Company acquired the business-to-business payment business known as Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”) from Travelex Holdings Limited for cash consideration
of £603 million ($967.8 million), plus an initial working capital adjustment. The acquisition of the French assets of TGBP for cash consideration of £3 million (approximately $4.7 million based on currency exchange rates at
December 31, 2011) has not been finalized as of December 31, 2011. This acquisition is expected to close in 2012, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of closing conditions. The final consideration and the final purchase price
allocation are subject to an additional working capital adjustment, further analysis of tax balances, final valuation of identifiable intangible assets, and other items. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company incurred $20.7 million
of costs associated with the closing of this acquisition. With the acquisition of TGBP and the Company’s existing Business Solutions business, the Company has the ability to leverage TGBP’s business-to-business payments market expertise,
distribution, product and capabilities with Western Union’s brand, existing Business Solutions operations, global infrastructure and relationships, and financial strength. The results of operations for TGBP have been included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

On October 31, 2011 and
April 20, 2011, the Company acquired the remaining 70% interests in European-based Finint S.r.l. (“Finint”) and Angelo Costa S.r.l. (“Costa”), respectively, two of the Company’s largest agents providing services in a
number of European countries. The Company previously held a 30% equity interest in each of these agents. The Company expects these acquisitions will help accelerate the introduction of additional Western Union products and services and will leverage
its existing European infrastructure to build new opportunities across the European Union. The acquisitions do not impact the Company’s money transfer revenue, because the Company was already recording all of the revenue arising from money
transfers originating at Finint’s and Costa’s subagents. As of the acquisition dates, the Company no longer incurs commission costs for transactions related to Finint and Costa; rather the Company now pays commissions to Finint and Costa
subagents, resulting in lower overall commission expense. The Company’s operating expenses include costs attributable to Finint’s and Costa’s operations subsequent to the acquisition dates.

The Company acquired the remaining 70% interest in Finint for cash consideration of €99.6 million
($139.4 million). The final purchase price allocation is subject to further analysis of tax balances and other items. The Company revalued its previous 30% equity interest to fair value of approximately $47.8 million on the acquisition
date, resulting in total value of $187.2 million. In conjunction with the revaluation, the Company recognized a gain of $20.5 million, recorded in “Other income, net” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, for
the amount by which the fair value of the 30% equity interest exceeded its previous carrying value.

The
Company acquired the remaining 70% interest in Costa for cash consideration of €95 million ($135.7 million), which included a reduction of €5 million ($7.1 million) for an initial working capital adjustment pursuant to
the terms of the purchase agreement. The final consideration and the final purchase price allocation are subject to an additional working capital adjustment. The Company revalued its previous 30% equity interest to fair value of approximately
$46.2 million on the acquisition date, resulting in total value of $181.9 million. In conjunction with the revaluation, the Company recognized a gain of $29.4 million, recorded in “Other income, net” in the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Income, for the amount by which the fair value of the 30% equity interest exceeded its previous carrying value.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

All assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value, excluding
deferred tax liabilities. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocations of purchase price (in millions):

(a)

Total purchase price includes cash consideration transferred and the revaluation of the Company’s previous equity interest, if any, to fair
value on the acquisition date.

The preliminary valuation of assets acquired were derived using primarily unobservable Level 3 inputs,
which require significant management judgment and estimation, and resulted in identifiable intangible assets as follows (in millions):

Customer and other contractual relationships and network of subagents identifiable intangible assets
were valued using an income approach and are being amortized over 10 to 11 years, subject to valuation completion. Other intangibles were valued using both income and cost approaches and are being amortized over one to five

years. For the remaining assets and liabilities excluding goodwill and deferred tax liabilities, fair value approximated carrying value.

The goodwill recognized for TGBP of $728.7 million is attributable to expected synergies, the projected long-term
business growth in current and new markets and an assembled workforce and relates entirely to the global business payments segment. The goodwill recognized for Finint and Costa of $153.1 million and $172.3 million, respectively, is attributable
to growth opportunities that will arise from the Company directly managing its agent relationships, expected synergies, projected long-term business growth and an assembled workforce and relates entirely to the consumer-to-consumer segment. Based on
the preliminary allocation of purchase price, goodwill expected to be deductible for income tax purposes for TGBP, Finint and Costa is approximately $470.6 million, $97.0 million and $104.9 million, respectively.

Other acquisitions

On September 1, 2009, the Company acquired Canada-based Custom House, a provider of international business-to-business payment services, for $371.0 million. The acquisition of Custom House
allowed the Company to enter the international business-to-business payments market. Custom House facilitates cross-border, cross-currency payment transactions. These payment transactions are conducted through various channels including the phone
and Internet. The significant majority of Custom House’s revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross-currency payments. In addition, this business writes foreign currency forward and option contracts
for its customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. The results of operations for Custom House have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from
the date of acquisition.

The Company recorded the assets and liabilities of Custom House at fair value,
excluding the deferred tax liability. The valuation of assets acquired resulted in $118.1 million of identifiable intangible assets, $99.8 million of which were attributable to customer and other contractual relationships and were valued
using an income approach and $18.3 million of other intangibles, which were valued using both income and cost approaches. For the remaining assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, fair value approximated carrying value. The intangible
assets related to customer and other contractual relationships are being amortized over 10 to 12 years. The remaining intangibles are being amortized over three to five years. The goodwill recognized of $264.3 million is attributable to
the projected long-term business growth in current and new markets and an assembled workforce. All goodwill relates entirely to the global business payments segment. Goodwill expected to be deductible for United States income tax purposes is
approximately $231.3 million.

On February 24, 2009, the Company acquired the money transfer
business of European-based FEXCO, one of the Company’s largest agents providing services in a number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Ireland. The acquisition of FEXCO’s money transfer business has
assisted the Company in the implementation of the Payment Services Directive (“PSD”) in the European Union by providing an initial operating infrastructure. The PSD has allowed the Company to operate under a single license in 27 European
countries and, in those European Union countries where the Company has been limited to working with banks, post-banks and foreign exchange houses, to expand its network to additional types of businesses. The acquisition does not impact the
Company’s revenue, because the Company was already recording all of the revenue arising from money transfers originating at FEXCO’s locations. As of the acquisition date, the Company no longer incurs commission costs for transactions
related to FEXCO; rather, the Company now pays commissions directly to former FEXCO subagents, resulting in lower overall commission expense. The Company’s operating expenses include costs attributable to FEXCO’s operations subsequent to
the acquisition date.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 24.65% interest in FEXCO
Group Holdings (“FEXCO Group”), which was a holding company for both the money transfer business as well as various unrelated businesses. The Company surrendered its 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group as non-cash consideration, which had an
estimated fair value of $86.2 million on the acquisition date, and paid €123.1 million ($157.4 million) as additional consideration for all of the common shares of the money transfer business, resulting in a total purchase price
of $243.6 million. The Company recognized no gain or loss in connection with the disposition of its equity interest in the FEXCO Group, because its estimated fair value approximated its carrying value. The Company recorded the assets and
liabilities of FEXCO at fair value, excluding the deferred tax liability. The valuation of assets acquired resulted in $74.9 million of identifiable intangible assets, $64.8 million of which were attributable to the network of subagents,
with $10.1 million relating to other intangibles. The subagent network intangible assets are being amortized over 10 to 15 years, and the remaining intangibles are being amortized over two to three years. Goodwill of $190.6 million
was recognized, of which $91.1 million is expected to be deductible for United States income tax purposes.

The following table presents changes to goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions):

4. Restructuring and Related Expenses

On May 25, 2010 and as subsequently revised, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) designed to reduce the Company’s overall headcount and migrate positions from various facilities, primarily within North America and Europe, to regional operating centers. Details of the
expenses incurred are included in the tables below. Included in these expenses are approximately $2 million of non-cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. As of
December 31, 2011, the Company has incurred all of the expenses related to the Restructuring Plan.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and
related expenses discussed above and the related restructuring accruals as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 (in millions):

(a)

Expenses include non-cash write-offs and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and leasehold improvements. However, these amounts were recognized
outside of the restructuring accrual.

(b)

Other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to new and existing Company facilities including expenses for hiring, training,
relocation, travel and professional fees. All such expenses will be recorded when incurred.

Restructuring and related expenses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows
(in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes the restructuring and related expenses by
reportable segment (in millions). These expenses have not been allocated to the Company’s segments disclosed in Note 17. While these items are identifiable to the Company’s segments, these expenses have been excluded from the
measurement of segment operating profit provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation.

The Company did not incur any material restructuring and related expenses in the year ended
December 31, 2009.

5. Related Party Transactions

The Company has ownership interests in certain of its agents accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The Company pays these agents, as it does its other agents, commissions for money transfer and other services provided on the Company’s behalf. Commission expense recognized for these agents for the years ended December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $131.9 million, $183.5 million and $203.2 million, respectively. Commission expense recognized for Finint prior to October 31, 2011, Costa prior to April 20, 2011, and FEXCO prior to February 24,
2009, the date of the acquisitions (see Note 3), was considered a related party transaction.

In July 2009,
the Company appointed a director who is also a director for a company holding significant investments in two of the Company’s existing agents. These agents had been agents of the Company prior to the director being appointed to the board. The
Company recognized commission expense of $58.8 million, $52.9 million and $54.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to these agents.

6. Commitments and Contingencies

Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees

The Company had approximately $120 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of
December 31, 2011 with expiration dates through 2015, the majority of which contain a one-year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. The
Company expects to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances.

Litigation and Related
Contingencies

In the second quarter of 2009, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department
of Justice (“DOJ”) served one of the Company’s subsidiaries with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents in connection with



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

an investigation into money transfers, including related foreign exchange rates, from the United States to the Dominican Republic from 2004 through the date of subpoena. The Company is
cooperating fully with the DOJ investigation. Due to the stage of the investigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation, or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, which could be associated with the resolution of
any possible criminal charges or civil claims that may be brought against the Company. Should such charges or claims be brought, the Company could face significant fines, damage awards or regulatory consequences which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company and one of
its subsidiaries are defendants in two purported class action lawsuits: James P. Tennille v. The Western Union Company and Robert P. Smet v. The Western Union Company, both of which are pending in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado. The original complaints asserted claims for violation of various consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, conversion and declaratory relief, based on allegations that the Company waits too long to inform consumers if their
money transfers are not redeemed by the recipients and that the Company uses the unredeemed funds to generate income until the funds are escheated to state governments. The Tennille complaint was served on the Company on April 27, 2009. The
Smet complaint was served on the Company on April 6, 2010. On September 21, 2009, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the Tennille complaint and gave the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. On October 21,
2009, Tennille filed an amended complaint. The Company moved to dismiss the Tennille amended complaint and the Smet complaint. On November 8, 2010, the Court denied the motion to dismiss as to the plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment and
conversion claims. On February 4, 2011, the Court dismissed plaintiffs’ consumer protection claims. On March 11, 2011, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that adds a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, various elements to its
declaratory relief claim and Western Union Financial Services, Inc. as a defendant. On April 25, 2011, the Company and Western Union Financial Services, Inc. filed a motion to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty and declaratory relief claims.
Western Union Financial Services, Inc. also moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs’ claims and to stay the action pending arbitration. On November 21, 2011, the Court denied the motion to compel arbitration and the stay request.
Both companies appealed the decision. On January 24, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit granted the companies’ request to stay the District Court proceedings pending their appeal. The plaintiffs have not sought
and the Court has not granted class certification. The Company and Western Union Financial Services, Inc. intend to vigorously defend themselves against both lawsuits. However, due to the preliminary stages of these lawsuits, the fact the plaintiffs
have not quantified their damage demands, and the uncertainty as to whether they will ever be certified as class actions, the potential outcome cannot be determined.

During 2009, the Company recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement with the State of
Arizona and other states, which was paid in 2010. On February 11, 2010, the Company signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required the Company to fund a
multi-state not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. The accrual included amounts for reimbursement to the State of
Arizona for its costs associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement, the Company has made and expects to make certain investments in its compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor
has been engaged for those programs. The costs of the investments in the Company’s programs and for the monitor are expected to reach up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013.

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation. Management of the Company believes
such matters involving a reasonably possible chance of loss will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company accrues for loss
contingencies as they become probable and estimable.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with First Data in
connection with the Spin-off, First Data and the Company are each liable for, and agreed to perform, all liabilities with respect to their respective businesses. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement also provides for
cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the Company’s business with the Company and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of First Data’s
retained businesses with First Data. The Company also entered into a tax allocation agreement that sets forth the rights and obligations of First Data and the Company with respect to taxes imposed on their respective businesses both prior to and
after the Spin-off as well as potential tax obligations for which the Company may be liable in conjunction with the Spin-off (see Note 10).

7. Investment Securities

Investment securities, classified within “Settlement assets” in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities, including variable rate demand notes. Variable rate demand note securities can be put (sold at par) typically on a daily basis with settlement periods ranging from the
same day to one week, but that have varying maturities through 2050. Generally, these securities are used by the Company for short-term liquidity needs and are held for short periods of time, typically less than 30 days. The Company is required to
hold specific highly-rated, investment grade securities and such investments are restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable state and foreign country requirements. The substantial majority of the
Company’s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. Western Union regularly monitors credit risk and
attempts to mitigate its exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and through investment diversification. As of December 31, 2011, the majority of the Company’s investment securities had credit ratings of “AA–” or
better from a major credit rating agency.

On October 1, 2009 (the “Transition Date”), the
Company assumed IPS’s role as issuer of money orders and terminated the existing agreement whereby IPS paid the Company a fixed return of 5.5% on the outstanding money order balances. Following the Transition Date, the Company invested the cash
received from IPS in highly-rated, investment grade securities, primarily tax exempt United States state and municipal debt securities, in accordance with applicable regulations.

Subsequent to the Transition Date, all revenue generated from the investment portfolio is being retained by the Company.
IPS continues to provide the Company with clearing services necessary for payment of the money orders in exchange for the payment by the Company to IPS of a per-item processing fee. The Company no longer provides to IPS the services required under
the original money order agreement or receives from IPS the fee for such services.

Unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of related deferred taxes. Proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities
during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $14.2 billion, $14.7 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. The transition of the money order business from IPS in October 2009, as described above, increased the frequency
of purchases and proceeds received by the Company in 2010 and 2011.

Gains and losses on investments are
calculated using the specific-identification method and are recognized during the period in which the investment is sold or when an investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value. Factors that could indicate an impairment exists
include, but are not limited to: earnings performance, changes in credit rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or economic environment of the asset.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

If potential impairment exists, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the debt security, more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated
recovery or expects that some of the contractual cash flows will not be received. The Company had no material other-than-temporary impairments during the periods presented.

The components of investment securities are as follows (in millions):

(a)

The majority of these securities are fixed rate instruments.

There were no investments with a single issuer or individual securities representing greater than 10%
of total investment securities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

The following summarizes contractual
maturities of investment securities as of December 31, 2011 (in millions):

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or
prepay the obligations or the Company may have the right to put the obligation prior to its contractual maturity, as with variable rate demand notes. Variable rate demand notes, having a fair value of $12.4 million, $65.4 million,



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

$6.0 million and $293.1 million are included in the “Due within 1 year,” “Due after 1 year through 5 years,” “Due after 5 years through
10 years” and “Due after 10 years” categories, respectively, in the table above.

8. Fair Value Measurements

Fair value, as defined by the relevant accounting standards, represents the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. For additional
information on how the Company measures fair value, refer to Note 2.

The following table reflects assets
and liabilities that were measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

No non-recurring fair value adjustments were recorded during the years
ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, except those associated with acquisitions, as disclosed in Note 3.

Other Fair Value Measurements

The carrying amounts for the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, settlement receivables and settlement obligations approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The Company’s borrowings had a carrying value and fair value of $3,583.2 million and
$3,563.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 and had a carrying value and fair value of $3,289.9 million and $3,473.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 15).

The fair value of the assets in the Trust, which holds the assets for the Company’s defined benefit plan, is
disclosed in Note 11.

9. Other Assets and Other Liabilities

The following table summarizes the components of other assets and other liabilities (in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Receivable for securities sold

On September 15, 2008, Western Union requested redemption of its shares from the Reserve International Liquidity
Fund, Ltd. (the “Fund”), a money market fund, totaling $298.1 million. Western Union included the value of the receivable in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At the time the redemption request was made, the
Company was informed by the Reserve Management Company, the Fund’s investment advisor, that the Company’s redemption trades would be honored at a $1.00 per share net asset value despite losses the Fund had incurred on certain holdings
resulting in the Fund subsequently reducing its net asset value. In 2009, the Company received partial distributions totaling $255.5 million from the Fund and recorded a reserve of $12 million, representing the estimated impact of a
pro-rata distribution of the Fund. On December 31, 2010, the Company received a final distribution from the Fund totaling $36.9 million. As a result of the final distribution, the Company recovered $6.3 million of the related reserve,
the impact of which is included in “Other income” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

10. Income Taxes

The components of pre-tax income, generally based on the jurisdiction of the legal entity, were as
follows (in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in domestic pre-tax income and decrease in
foreign pre-tax income are primarily due to the current year pre-tax impact of the Company’s agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS Agreement”) resolving substantially all of the issues related to the
Company’s restructuring of its international operations in 2003.

The provision for income taxes was as
follows (in millions):

Domestic taxes have been incurred on certain pre-tax income amounts that were generated by the
Company’s foreign operations. Accordingly, the percentage obtained by dividing the total federal, state and local tax provision by the domestic pre-tax income, all as shown in the preceding tables, may be higher than the statutory tax rates in
the United States.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s effective tax rates differed from statutory rates as
follows:

The decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is
primarily due to an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) resolving substantially all of the issues related to the Company’s restructuring of its international operations in 2003, as described below,
slightly offset by higher taxes associated with the Finint and Costa remeasurement gains. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a cumulative tax planning benefit from certain foreign acquisitions and the settlement
with the IRS of certain issues relating to the 2002-2004 tax years. The Company continues to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign-derived, and therefore taxed at lower rates than its combined federal and state tax rates in
the United States.

The Company’s provision for income taxes consisted of the following components (in
millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities. The following table outlines the principal components of deferred tax items (in millions):

Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company has established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2011, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $135.0 million, including
accrued interest and penalties, net of related benefits. The Company’s tax reserves reflect management’s judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While the Company believes its reserves are
adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, the
Company’s income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any difference from
the Company’s tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements in future periods and could impact operating cash flows.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of
differences between tax return positions and the amounts otherwise recognized in the Company’s financial statements, and are reflected in “Income taxes payable” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):

(a)

Includes recurring accruals for issues which initially arose in previous periods.

(b)

Changes to positions taken in prior periods relate to changes in estimates used to calculate prior period unrecognized tax benefits.

(c)

Balance at December 31, 2011, includes amounts related to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign tax matters.

In December 2011, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the
issues related to the Company’s restructuring of its international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, the Company expects to make cash payments to the IRS and various state tax authorities in 2012 of approximately $190
million, which are in addition to the $250 million tax deposit (see below) the Company made with the IRS in 2010. This deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to the Company’s related tax liabilities, to the extent
of the deposit. Also as a result of the IRS Agreement, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $115.6 million
and $555.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, excluding interest and penalties.

The
Company recognizes interest and penalties with respect to unrecognized tax benefits in “Provision for income taxes” in its Consolidated Statements of Income, and records the associated liability in “Income taxes payable” in its
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized ($4.0) million, $6.9 million and $11.0 million in interest and penalties during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has accrued $20.7 million
and $52.4 million for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company has identified no uncertain tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months. The
change in



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

unrecognized tax benefits during the year ended December 31, 2011 is substantially attributable to the settlement with the IRS discussed above. The unrecognized tax benefits accrual as of
December 31, 2011, consists of federal, state and foreign tax matters.

The Company and its subsidiaries
file tax returns for the United States, for multiple states and localities, and for various non-United States jurisdictions, and the Company has identified the United States and Ireland as its two major tax jurisdictions. The United States federal
income tax returns of First Data, which include the Company, are eligible to be examined for the years 2003 through 2006. The Company’s United States federal income tax returns since the Spin-off are also eligible to be examined. The IRS
completed its examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004, which included the Company, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency alleged significant
additional taxes, interest and penalties owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Company generally has responsibility for taxes associated with these potential Company-related adjustments
under the tax allocation agreement with First Data executed at the time of the Spin-off. A substantial part of the alleged amounts due related to the Company’s international restructuring, which took effect in the fourth quarter of 2003. In
December 2011, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the Company’s restructuring of its international operations in 2003, as noted above. An examination of the United States federal
consolidated income tax returns of First Data that cover the Company’s 2005 and pre-Spin-off 2006 taxable periods is ongoing, as is an examination of the Company’s United States federal consolidated income tax returns for the 2006
post-Spin-off period through 2009. The Irish income tax returns of certain subsidiaries for the years 2007 and forward are eligible to be examined by the Irish tax authorities, although no examinations have commenced.

In the first quarter of 2010, the Company made a $250 million tax deposit relating to United States federal tax
liabilities, including those arising from the Company’s 2003 international restructuring, which have been previously accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The deposit was recorded as a reduction to “Income taxes
payable” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a decrease in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such tax
liabilities, to the extent of the deposit.

As of December 31, 2011, no provision had been made for
United States federal and state income taxes on certain of the Company’s outside tax basis differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $3.7 billion, which are expected to be reinvested outside the
United States indefinitely. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, the Company would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits),
state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. Such taxes could be significant. Determination of this amount of unrecognized deferred United States tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities
associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Tax Allocation Agreement with First Data

The Company and First Data each are liable for taxes imposed on their respective businesses both prior to and after the
Spin-off. If such taxes have not been appropriately apportioned between First Data and the Company, subsequent adjustments may occur that may impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Also under the tax allocation agreement, with respect to taxes and other liabilities that result from a final
determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the Spin-off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant tax opinion) (“Spin-off Related Taxes”), the Company will be liable to First Data for

11. Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plans

The Western Union Company Incentive Savings Plan (“401(k)”) covers eligible employees on the United States payroll of the Company. Employees who make voluntary contributions to this plan receive
up to a 4% Company matching contribution. All matching contributions are immediately vested.

The Company
administers more than 25 defined contribution plans in various countries globally on behalf of approximately 1,300 employee participants as of December 31, 2011. Such plans have vesting and employer contribution provisions that vary by
country.

In addition, the Company sponsors a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of
highly compensated employees. The plan provides tax-deferred contributions, matching and the restoration of Company matching contributions otherwise limited under the 401(k).

The aggregate amount charged to expense in connection with all of the above plans was $12.8 million, $12.0 million
and $11.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Defined Benefit Plan

On December 31, 2010, the Company merged its two frozen defined benefit pension plans into one
plan (“Plan”). The Plan assets were held in a master trust and were identical in terms of their benefit entitlements and other provisions (except for participant eligibility requirements) and consequently, the financial effect of the
merger was not significant.

The Plan had recorded unfunded pension obligations of $112.7 million and
$112.8 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, included in “Other liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company made contributions of
approximately $25 million to the Plan, including discretionary contributions of $3 million and $10 million, respectively. Due to the closure of one of its facilities in Missouri and an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the Company funded $4.1 million during 2009. The Company will be required to fund approximately $20 million to the Plan in 2012 and may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $5 million.

The Company recognizes the funded status of the Plan in its Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment
to “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” net of tax.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the
Plan’s projected benefit obligation, fair value of assets and the funded status (in millions):

Differences in expected returns on plan assets estimated at the beginning of the year versus actual
returns, and assumptions used to estimate the beginning of year projected benefit obligation versus the end of year obligation (principally discount rate and mortality assumptions) are, on a combined basis, considered actuarial gains and losses.
Such actuarial gains and losses are recognized as a component of “Comprehensive income” and amortized to income over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Included in “Accumulated other comprehensive
loss” as of December 31, 2011 is $10.5 million ($6.5 million, net of tax) of actuarial losses that are expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the year ended December 31, 2012.

The following table provides the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):

The accrued loss related to the pension liability included in “Accumulated other comprehensive
loss”, net of tax, increased $12.5 million, $3.9 million and $11.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The rate assumptions used in the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligation were as follows:



Discount rate

3.72%

4.69%

The rate assumptions used in the measurement of the Company’s net cost were as follows:




Discount rate

Expected long-term return on plan assets

7.00%

The Company measures the Plan’s obligations and annual expense using assumptions that reflect best
estimates and are consistent to the extent that each assumption reflects expectations of future economic conditions. As the bulk of the pension benefits will not be paid for many years, the computation of pension expenses and benefits is based on
assumptions about future interest rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. In general, pension obligations are most sensitive to the discount rate assumption, and it is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled
effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities.

The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical
markets are studied and long-term historical risk, return, and co-variance relationships between equities, fixed-income securities, and alternative investments are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets
with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to diversification,
re-balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical returns are reviewed within the context of current economic conditions to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. The Company then applies this rate against a
calculated value for its plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five-year period.

The assets of the Company’s Plan are managed in a third-party Trust. The investment policy and
allocation of the assets in the Trust are overseen by the Company’s Investment Council. The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity, fixed income, and alternative investments are used in an effort to maximize
the long-term return of plan assets. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities and plan funded status. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments
(e.g. hedge funds, royalty rights and private equity funds). Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as securities deemed to be growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.
Alternative investments, the significant majority of which are hedge funds, are used in an effort to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to:
commodities/currencies, equity long-short, relative value, multi-strategy, event driven, and global-macro. The Plan holds derivative contracts directly which consist of standardized obligations to buy or sell United States treasury bonds or notes at
predetermined future dates and prices which are transacted on regulated exchanges. Additionally, derivatives are held indirectly through funds in which the Plan is invested. Derivatives are used by the Plan to help reduce the Plan’s
exposure to interest rate volatility and to provide an additional source of return. Cash held by the Plan is used to satisfy margin requirements on the derivatives. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly
investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies.

13. Stockholders’ Equity

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes all changes in equity during a period that have yet to be recognized in
income, except those resulting from transactions with shareholders. The major components include unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, gains or losses from cash flow hedging activities, foreign currency translation adjustments and
pension liability adjustments.

Unrealized gains and losses on investment securities that are available for
sale, primarily state and municipal debt securities, are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” until the investment is either sold or deemed other-than-temporarily impaired. See Note 7 for further discussion.

The effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in
“Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” Generally, amounts are recognized in income when the related forecasted transaction affects earnings. See Note 14 for further discussion.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the United States dollar are
translated using the appropriate exchange rate as of the end of the year. Foreign currency translation adjustments represent unrealized gains and losses on assets and liabilities arising from the difference in the foreign country currency compared
to the United States dollar. These gains and losses are accumulated in comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is substantially liquidated, the cumulative translation gain or loss is removed from “Accumulated other comprehensive
loss” and is recognized as a component of the gain or loss on the sale of the subsidiary.

A pension
liability adjustment associated with the defined benefit pension plan is recognized for the difference between estimated assumptions (e.g., asset returns, discount rates, mortality) and actual results. The amount in “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss” is amortized to income over the remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Details of the pension plan’s assets and obligations are explained further in Note 11.

Cash Dividends Paid

During 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share in the second through fourth quarters of 2011 and $0.07 per share in the first quarter
representing $194.2 million in total dividends. Of this amount, $49.6 million was paid on both December 30, 2011 and October 7, 2011, $50.3 million was paid on June 30, 2011 and $44.7 million was paid on March 31, 2011.
During 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per common share in each of the first three quarters representing $165.3 million in total dividends.
Of this amount, $45.8 million was paid on December 31, 2010, $39.4 million was paid on October 14, 2010, $39.6 million was paid on June 30, 2010 and $40.5 million was paid on March 31, 2010. During the fourth
quarter of 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.06 per common share representing $41.2 million in total dividends, paid on December 30, 2009.

On February 7, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share
payable on March 30, 2012.

Share Repurchases

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, 40.3 million, 35.6 million and 24.8 million
shares, respectively, have been repurchased for $800.0 million, $584.5 million and $400.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $19.83, $16.44 and $16.10 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2011,
$615.5 million remains available under share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors through December 31, 2012.

14. Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in exchange
rates, primarily the euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies, related to forecasted money transfer revenues and on money transfer settlement assets and obligations. The Company is also exposed to risk
from derivative contracts written to its customers arising from its cross-currency business-to-business payments operations. Additionally, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in market rates both prior to and subsequent
to the issuance of debt. The Company uses derivatives to (a) minimize its exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross-currency business-to-business payments by writing
derivatives to customers.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company executes derivatives with established financial
institutions, with the substantial majority of these financial institutions having credit ratings of “A–” or better from a major credit rating agency. The Company also executes global business payments derivatives mostly with small
and medium size enterprises. The primary credit risk inherent in derivative agreements represents the possibility that a loss may occur from the nonperformance of a counterparty to the agreements. The Company performs a review of the credit risk of
these counterparties at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis. The Company also monitors the concentration of its contracts with any individual counterparty. The Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully
satisfy their obligations under the agreements, but takes action (including termination of contracts) when doubt arises about the counterparties’ ability to perform. The Company’s hedged foreign currency exposures are in liquid currencies;
consequently, there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the hedging program would not be available in the future.

Foreign Currency—Consumer-to-Consumer

The Company’s policy is to use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts, with maturities of up to
36 months at inception and a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year, to mitigate some of the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the United States dollar could have on forecasted revenues
denominated in other currencies related to its business. As of December 31, 2011, the Company’s longer-term foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of a maximum of 24 months with a weighted-average maturity of approximately
one year. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenue, with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the spot rate of the affected currencies during the period of designation. Accordingly, all changes in the fair
value of the hedges not considered effective or portions of the hedge that are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in “Derivative gains/(losses), net” within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Income.

The Company also uses short duration foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities
from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on settlement assets and obligations between initiation and settlement. In addition, forward contracts, typically with maturities of less than one year, are utilized to
offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. None of these contracts are designated as accounting hedges.

The aggregate equivalent United States dollar notional amounts of foreign currency forward contracts
as of December 31, 2011 were as follows (in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Foreign Currency—Global Business Payments

The Company writes derivatives, primarily foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts, mostly with small and
medium size enterprises and derives a currency spread from this activity as part of its global business payments operations. The Company aggregates its global business payments foreign currency exposures arising from customer contracts, including
the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties (economic hedge contracts). The derivatives written are part of the
broader portfolio of foreign currency positions arising from its cross-currency business-to-business payments operations, which primarily include spot exchanges of currency in addition to forwards and options. Foreign exchange revenues from the
total portfolio of positions were $154.6 million, $105.0 million, and $28.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. None of the derivative contracts used in global business payments operations are designated
as accounting hedges. The duration of these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less.

The
aggregate equivalent United States dollar notional amounts of foreign currency derivative customer contracts held by the Company in its global business payments operations as of December 31, 2011 were approximately $3.3 billion. The
significant majority of customer contracts are written in major currencies such as the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Australian dollar.

The Company has forward contracts to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on a Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan. These contracts, which are not designated as accounting hedges, had a
notional amount of approximately 240 million and 245 million Canadian dollars as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Interest Rate Hedging—Corporate

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of its notes from
fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to manage its overall exposure to interest rates. The Company designates these derivatives as fair value hedges utilizing the short-cut method, which permits an assumption
of no ineffectiveness if certain criteria are met. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps is offset by a change in the carrying value of the debt being hedged within the Company’s “Borrowings” in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and “Interest expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income has been adjusted to include the effects of interest accrued on the swaps.

The Company, at times, utilizes derivatives to hedge the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the fixed rate coupon of the
debt expected to be issued. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company held interest rate swaps in an aggregate notional amount of $500.0
million and $1,195.0 million, respectively. The aggregate notional amount held at December 31, 2011 related to notes due in 2014.

(d)

The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts as part of its business-to-business payments operations. These derivative contracts
are excluded from this table as they are managed as part of a broader currency portfolio that includes non-derivative currency exposures. The gains and losses on these derivatives are included as part of the broader disclosure of portfolio revenue
for this business discussed above.

(e)

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on settlement assets and obligations as well as
certain foreign currency denominated positions. Foreign exchange gain/(loss) on settlement assets and obligations and cash balances were ($20.5) million, ($2.5) million and $2.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(f)

The derivative contracts used in the Company’s revenue hedging program are not designated as hedges in the final month of the contract.
Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company entered into derivative contracts, consisting of foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of less than one year, to reduce the economic variability related to the cash
amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition, and recorded a net gain of $20.8 million in “Derivative gains/(losses), net.”

An accumulated other comprehensive pre-tax gain of $15.4 million related to the foreign currency
forward contracts is expected to be reclassified into revenue within the next 12 months as of December 31, 2011. Approximately $3.6 million of net losses on the forecasted debt issuance hedges are expected to be recognized in
“Interest expense” within the next 12 months as of December 31, 2011. No amounts have been reclassified into earnings as a result of the underlying transaction being considered probable of not occurring within the specified time
period.

The Company’s outstanding borrowings consisted of the following (in millions):

(a)

The 5.400% notes due in November 2011 (“2011 Notes”) were repaid using the Company’s cash, including cash generated from
operations and proceeds from the Company’s 2011 borrowings and commercial paper issuances.

(b)

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of its notes
from fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to manage its overall exposure to interest rates. The changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps result in an offsetting hedge accounting adjustment recorded
to the carrying value of the related note. These hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to or increases in “Interest expense” over the life of the related notes, and cause the effective rate of interest to differ
from the notes’ stated rate.

(c)

On March 7, 2011, the Company issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due March 7, 2013
(“2013 Notes”). Interest is payable quarterly at a per annum interest rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 58 basis points (1.11% as of December 31, 2011) and is reset quarterly. See below for additional detail relating to
the debt issuance.

contracts of $21.6 million, which increased the effective rate to 4.4%, in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” which will be amortized into “Interest expense” over the
life of the 2018 Notes. See below for additional detail relating to the debt issuance.

(f)

As of December 31, 2011, the Company’s weighted-average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 4.8%.

The aggregate fair value of the Company’s borrowings, based on quotes from multiple banks,
excluding the impact of related interest rate swaps, was $3,563.5 million and $3,473.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company’s maturities of borrowings at par value as of December 31, 2011 are $300.0 million in 2012, $300.0 million in 2013, $500.0 million in 2014, $1.0 billion in 2016 and
approximately $1.5 billion thereafter.

The Company’s obligations with respect to its outstanding
borrowings, as described below, rank equally.

Commercial Paper Program

Pursuant to the Company’s commercial paper program, the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an
amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility. The Commercial Paper Notes may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of
issuance. The Company’s commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2011 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of approximately 0.6% and a weighted-average term of 9 days. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the average
commercial paper balance outstanding was $89.7 million and the maximum balance outstanding was $784.1 million. Proceeds from the Company’s commercial paper borrowings were used for general liquidity. The Company had $297.0 million of commercial
paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010.

Revolving
Credit Facility

On September 23, 2011, the Company entered into a credit agreement which expires
January 2017 providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of $1.65 billion, including a $250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub-facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”). The
Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Company’s $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that was set to expire in September 2012. Consistent with the prior facility, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that, among other
things, limit or restrict the Company’s ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter
into sale and leaseback transactions, or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. Also consistent with the prior facility, the Company is required to maintain compliance with a consolidated interest coverage ratio
covenant. The Revolving Credit Facility supports borrowings under the Company’s $1.5 billion commercial paper program.

Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR
rate plus an interest rate margin of 90 basis points. A facility fee of 10 basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of the
Company’s credit ratings.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As of and during the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company had
no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $297.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which left $1,353.0 million remaining that was available to borrow on the
Revolving Credit Facility.

Notes

On August 22, 2011, the Company issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due August 22, 2018. Interest with respect to the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually
in arrears on February 22 and August 22 of each year, based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 3.650%. The 2018 Notes are subject to covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company to sell or transfer
assets or merge or consolidate with another company, and limit or restrict the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain types of security interests, or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. If a
change of control triggering event occurs, holders of the 2018 Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of their notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company

On March 7, 2011, the Company issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due March 7, 2013. Interest with respect to the 2013 Notes is payable
quarterly in arrears on each March 7, June 7, September 7 and December 7, beginning June 7, 2011, at a per annum interest rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 58 basis points (reset quarterly). The 2013 Notes are
subject to covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, and limit or restrict the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’
ability to incur certain types of security interests, or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. If a change of control triggering event occurs, holders of the 2013 Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of their notes at a
price equal to 101% of the principal amount of their notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

On
June 21, 2010, the Company issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 (“2040 Notes”). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 21 and
December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. The 2040 Notes are subject to covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to grant certain
types of security interests or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points.

Notes for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”). Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 5.253%. In
connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was
not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be accreted into “Interest expense” over the life of the notes. The 2020 Notes are subject to covenants that, among other things,
limit or restrict the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to grant certain types of security interests, incur debt (in the case of significant subsidiaries), or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The Company may
redeem the 2020 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points.

16. Stock Compensation Plans

Stock Compensation Plans

The Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2006 LTIP”) provides for the granting of stock
options, restricted stock awards and units, unrestricted stock awards and other equity-based awards to employees who perform services for the Company. A maximum of 120.0 million shares of common stock may be awarded under the 2006 LTIP, of
which 36.1 million shares are available as of December 31, 2011.

Options granted under the 2006
LTIP are issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of Western Union common stock on the grant date, have 10-year terms, and typically vest over four equal annual increments beginning 12 months after the date of grant, with the
exception of options granted to retirement eligible employees, which will vest on a prorated basis. Compensation expense related to stock options is recognized over the requisite service period.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Restricted stock awards and units granted under the 2006 LTIP typically
become 100% vested on the three year anniversary of the grant date, with the exception of restricted stock units granted to retirement eligible employees, which will vest on a prorated basis. The fair value of the awards granted is measured based on
the fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents. For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent
payments. The related compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period which is the same as the vesting period.

In 2011, the compensation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors granted the Company’s executives and other key employees, long-term incentive awards under the 2006 LTIP which consisted
of two-thirds performance based restricted stock unit awards and one-third stock option awards. The performance based restricted stock units are restricted stock awards. The grant date fair value is fixed and the amount of restricted stock units
depends upon certain financial and strategic performance objectives being met over a two-year period plus an additional one-year vesting period after the two-year performance period. The actual number of performance based restricted stock units that
the recipients receive ranges from 0% to 300% of the target number of stock units granted under the LTIP based on the achievement of the performance objectives. Additionally, in 2011, non-executive employees of the Company participating in the 2006
LTIP received annual equity grants of two-thirds restricted stock units and one-third stock option awards, or all restricted stock units depending on their employment grade level.

The Western Union Company 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan

The Western Union Company 2006 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan (“2006 Director Plan”) provides for the granting of equity-based awards to non-employee directors of the
Company. Options granted under the 2006 Director Plan are issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of Western Union common stock at the grant date, have 10-year terms, and vest immediately. Since options and deferred stock
units under this plan vest immediately, compensation expense is recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of the awards when granted. Awards under the plan may be settled immediately unless the participant elects to defer the receipt
of the common shares under applicable plan rules. A maximum of 1.5 million shares of common stock may be awarded under the 2006 Director Plan. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has awarded 1.0 million options and
0.3 million unrestricted stock units to non-employee directors of the Company.

Impact of Spin-Off to Stock-Based Awards Granted
Under First Data Plans

At the time of the Spin-off, First Data converted stock options, restricted
stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively, “Stock-Based Awards”) of First Data stock held by Western Union and First Data employees. For Western Union employees, each outstanding First Data Stock-Based Award was converted to
new Western Union Stock-Based Awards. For First Data employees, each outstanding First Data Stock-Based Award held prior to the Spin-off was converted into one replacement First Data Stock-Based Award and one Western Union Stock-Based Award. The new
Western Union and First Data Stock-Based Awards maintained their pre-conversion aggregate intrinsic values, and, in the case of stock options, their ratio of the exercise price per share to their fair value per share.

All converted Stock-Based Awards, which had not vested prior to September 24, 2007, were subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to the original First Data Stock-Based Awards, including change of control provisions which required full vesting upon a change of control of First Data. Accordingly, upon the completion of the acquisition of First Data on
September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.’s, all of these



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

remaining converted unvested Western Union Stock-Based Awards vested. As a result of this accelerated vesting, there is no remaining unamortized compensation expense associated with such
converted Stock-Based Awards.

After the Spin-off, the Company receives all cash proceeds related to the
exercise of all Western Union stock options, recognizes all stock compensation expense and retains the resulting tax benefits relating to Western Union awards held by Western Union employees. First Data recognizes all stock-based compensation
expense and retains all associated tax benefits for Western Union Stock-Based Awards held by First Data employees.

Stock Option
Activity

A summary of Western Union stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2011
was as follows (options and aggregate intrinsic value in millions):

As of December 31, 2011, approximately 32% of outstanding options to purchase shares of common
stock of the Company were held by employees of First Data.

The Company received $98.8 million,
$44.1 million and $23.9 million in cash proceeds related to the exercise of stock options during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Upon the exercise of stock options, shares of common stock are issued
from authorized common shares.

The Company’s calculated pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb
write-offs of deferred tax assets in subsequent periods was approximately $6.1 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company realized total tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 from stock option
exercises of $4.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

The total intrinsic value
of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $20.6 million, $8.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Activity

A summary of Western Union activity for restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted
stock awards for the year ended December 31, 2011 is listed below (awards/units in millions):

Stock-Based Compensation

The following table sets forth the total impact on earnings for stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income resulting from stock options, restricted stock awards,
restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units and deferred stock units for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions, except per share data).

As of December 31, 2011, there was $17.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net
of assumed forfeitures, related to non-vested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years, and there was $34.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of assumed forfeitures,
related to non-vested restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Fair Value Assumptions

The Company used the following assumptions for the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the value of Western
Union options granted.

Expected volatility

—For the Company’s executives and non-employee
directors, the expected volatility for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 grants was 29.7%, 32.8% and 46.9%, respectively. The expected volatility for the Company’s non-executive employees was 31.9%, 34.5% and 46.0% for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 grants,
respectively. The Company used a blend of implied and historical volatility. The Company’s implied volatility was calculated using the market price of traded options on Western Union’s common stock and the historical volatility represented
a blend of Western Union and First Data (prior to the Spin-off) stock data.

Expected dividend
yield

—The Company’s expected annual dividend yield is the calculation of the annualized Western Union dividend divided by an average Western Union stock price on each respective grant date. The 2011 grants made prior to May 19,
2011 do not reflect the increase in dividend approved by the Board of Directors on this date. The 2010 and 2009 grants do not reflect the increase in dividends approved by the Board of Directors on December 8, 2010 and December 9, 2009,
respectively, as all 2010 and 2009 grants were issued prior to that date.

Expected term

—For 2011,
2010 and 2009, Western Union’s expected term was approximately 5 years for non-executive employees and approximately 7 years for executives and non-employee directors. The Company’s expected term of options was based upon, among other
things, historical exercises (including the exercise history of First Data’s awards), the vesting term of the Company’s options and the options’ contractual term of ten years.

Risk-free interest rate

—The risk-free rate for stock options granted during the period is determined by using
a United States Treasury rate for the period that coincided with the expected terms listed above.

The
assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted will be evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company’s historical experience and future expectations. The calculated fair value is recognized
as compensation cost in the Company’s consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the entire award. Compensation cost is recognized only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of
grant and evaluated and adjusted periodically to reflect the Company’s historical experience and future expectations. Any change in the forfeiture assumption will be accounted for as a change in estimate, with the cumulative effect of the
change on periods previously reported being reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the period in which the change is made. In the future, as more historical data is available to calculate the volatility of Western Union stock and the
actual terms Western Union employees



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

hold options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could change the grant-date fair value of future stock option awards and, ultimately, the recorded compensation expense.

17. Segments

As previously described in Note 1, the Company classifies its businesses into two reportable
operating segments: consumer-to-consumer and global business payments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the Company’s CODM in deciding where to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

The consumer-to-consumer reporting segment is viewed as one global network where a money transfer can be sent from one
location to another, around the world, including related transactions that can be initiated from our websites. The segment consists of three regions, which primarily coordinate agent network management and marketing activities. The CODM makes
decisions regarding resource allocation and monitors performance based on specific corridors within and across these regions, but also reviews total revenue and operating profit of each region. These regions frequently interact on transactions with
consumers and share processes, systems and licenses, thereby constituting one global consumer-to-consumer money transfer network. The regions and corridors generally offer the same services distributed by the same agent network, have the same types
of customers, are subject to similar regulatory requirements, are processed on the same system and have similar economic characteristics, allowing the geographic regions to be aggregated into one reporting segment.

The global business payments segment processes payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. The results of
the Company’s existing consumer-to-business operations, as well as the Company’s existing Western Union Business Solutions business and recently acquired TGBP business, have been combined in this segment as these businesses are focused on
facilitating payments. For further information on these global business payments segment acquisitions, see Note 3.

All businesses that have not been classified into consumer-to-consumer or global business payments are reported as “Other.” These businesses primarily include the Company’s money order and
prepaid services businesses.

The Company’s reportable segments are reviewed separately below because
each reportable segment represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets. The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, the Company’s CODM are computed in accordance with the
following principles:

•

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

•

Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments’ revenue compared to total revenue.

•

Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions are included in “Other.”

•

Restructuring and related expenses of $46.8 million and $59.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were
not allocated to the segments. The Company did not incur any material restructuring and related expenses in the year ended December 31, 2009. While these items were identifiable to the Company’s segments, they were not included in the
measurement of segment operating profit provided



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities, refer to
Note 4.

•

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement with the State
of Arizona and other states. The agreement and settlement includes resolution of all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and a multi-state agreement to fund a not-for-profit organization promoting safety and security along the United
States and Mexico border. While this item was identifiable to the Company’s consumer-to-consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and
decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement, refer to Note 6.

•

All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table presents the Company’s reportable segment
results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in millions):



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Information concerning principal geographic areas was as follows (in
millions):

The consumer-to-consumer geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer
is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, the Company splits the revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid
in the same region, 100% of the revenue is attributed to that region. The geographic split of revenue above for global business payments is based upon the country where the transaction is initiated with 100% of the revenue allocated to that country.
Long-lived assets, consisting of “Property and equipment, net,” are presented based upon the location of the assets.

A significant majority of the Company’s consumer-to-consumer transactions involve at least one non-United States location. Based on the method used to attribute revenue between countries described in
the paragraph above, each individual country outside the United States accounted for less than 10% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. In addition, each individual agent or global business payments customer
accounted for less than 10% of revenue during these periods.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

2012 Changes in Reportable Segments

In connection with the acquisition of TGBP, recent management changes, and other key strategic initiatives, the Company
will implement a new segment structure to assess performance and allocate resources, beginning in the first quarter of 2012. The changes in the Company’s segment structure primarily relate to the separation of the Global Business Payments
segment into two new reportable segments, Consumer-to-Business and Business Solutions. A summary of how the segments will be structured follows:

18. Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

Summarized quarterly results for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in
millions, except per share data):

(a)

Includes $24.0 million in the first quarter, $8.9 million in the second quarter and $13.9 million in the third quarter of restructuring
and related expenses. For more information, see Note 4.



THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(b)

The second quarter includes a gain of $29.4 million, recognized in connection with the remeasurement of the Company’s former equity interest in
Costa to fair value. The fourth quarter includes a net gain of $20.8 million recorded on derivative contracts, consisting of foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of less than one year, entered into to reduce the economic variability
related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition. The fourth quarter also includes a gain of $20.5 million, recognized in connection with
the remeasurement of the Company’s former equity interest in Finint to fair value.

(c)

In December 2011, the Company reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the Company’s
restructuring of its international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million in the fourth quarter related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter.

(d)

Includes $34.5 million in the second quarter, $14.0 million in the third quarter and $11.0 million in the fourth quarter of restructuring
and related expenses. For more information, see Note 4.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE REGISTRANT

THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The Western Union Company (the “Parent”) is a holding company that conducts substantially
all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. Under a parent company only presentation, the Parent’s investments in its consolidated subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting, and the condensed financial
statements do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with The Western Union Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2. Restricted Net Assets

Certain assets of the Parent’s subsidiaries totaling approximately $230 million constitute
restricted net assets, as there are legal or regulatory limitations on transferring such assets outside of the countries where the respective assets are located, or because they constitute undistributed earnings of affiliates of the Parent accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2011, the Parent is in a stockholders’ equity position of $894.8 million, and as such, the restricted net assets of the Parent’s subsidiaries currently exceeds 25% of
the consolidated net assets of the Parent and its subsidiaries, thus requiring this Schedule I, “Condensed Financial Information of the Registrant.”

3. Related Party Transactions

Excess cash generated from operations of the Parent’s subsidiaries that is not required to meet
certain regulatory requirements is paid periodically to the Parent and is reflected as “Payable to subsidiaries, net” in the Condensed Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Parent’s subsidiaries periodically
distribute excess cash balances to the Parent in the form of a dividend, although the amounts of such dividends may vary from year to year.

The Parent files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, and also a number of consolidated state income tax returns on behalf of its subsidiaries. In these circumstances, the Parent
is responsible for remitting income tax payments on behalf of the consolidated group. The Parent’s provision for income taxes has been computed as if it were a separate tax-paying entity.

4. Commitments and Contingencies

The Parent had $13.3 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, including
parental guarantees for subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2011 with expiration dates through 2012. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with credit-related dealings, which include, but are not limited to,
derivatives and foreign exchange transactions. The Company expects to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our controls and procedures related to our reporting and disclosure obligations as of December 31, 2011, which is the end of the period covered
by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s report on Western
Union’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and the related Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, are set forth
under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
of Travelex Global Business Payments (“TGBP”), which was acquired on November 7, 2011 and is included in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and for the period from November 7, 2011 through
December 31, 2011. The assets of TGBP, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, net, constituted approximately 3% of our total assets as of December 31, 2011, and TGBP revenues constituted approximately 0.6% of our total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2011. Under guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year
following the acquisition while integrating the acquired company.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
