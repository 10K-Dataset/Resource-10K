PART I

Item 1. Business

Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company"), operating through its subsidiaries, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a wide range of food, protective and
specialty packaging products.

The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US). These two subsidiaries directly
and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. References herein to the Company include, collectively,
the Company and its subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise.

Segments

The Company operates in two reportable business segments: (i) Food Packaging and (ii) Protective and Specialty Packaging, described more fully
below. Information concerning the Company's reportable segments appears in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Food Packaging Products

The Company's principal food packaging products are its flexible materials and related systems marketed primarily under the Cryovac® trademark for a
broad range of perishable food applications. This segment also includes the Company's rigid packaging and absorbent pads (foam and solid plastic trays and containers for the packaging of a wide
variety of food products and absorbent pads used for the packaging of meat, fish and poultry). The products in this segment are primarily sold to food processors, distributors and food service
businesses.

Flexible Materials and Related Systems

The Company produces a variety of high-performance proprietary flexible films, bags and associated packaging equipment marketed and sold primarily
under the Cryovac® trademark that are used to package a broad range of perishable foods such as fresh meat, smoked and processed meat, cheese, poultry, processed and prepared foods
(including soups and sauces for restaurants and institutions) and produce.

Cryovac®
food packaging products include shrink bags, shrink films and laminated films sold for food packaging applications. Shrink bags and films are
co-extruded, multi-layered, shrinkable plastic bags and films that, when exposed to heat, mold themselves to the shape of the product. Laminated films are multi-layered,
non-shrinkable plastic materials used to package perishable foods and shelf-stable products such as syrups and toppings. Films and bags are sold in barrier and permeable forms, depending
on the extent to which it is desirable that oxygen or other gases pass through the material. For fresh-cut produce, the Company produces films that permit gases to pass through at various
rates, thereby matching the varying respiration rates of different vegetables and permitting longer shelf life.

The
Company's food packaging equipment offerings include dispensing and loading units to package foods in shrink, vacuum or vacuum skin packages, which can utilize the Company's films
and bags; form-fill-seal units to package foods in pouches, which can be made using the Company's films; shrink tunnels; bagging systems; and auxiliary equipment. Systems are
marketed to the food processing industry under the Cryovac® trademark and other trademarks.

Rigid Packaging and Absorbent Pads

The Company manufactures and sells polystyrene foam and solid plastic trays and containers that are used for the packaging of a wide variety of food products.
Supermarkets and food processors use these products to protect and display fresh meat, poultry, produce and other food products. The Company also manufactures and sells absorbent pads used for food
packaging, including its Dri-Loc®

absorbent pads. The Company's trays and pads are often used together. The Company's case ready packaging customers, principally meat and poultry processors, purchase trays, pads and specially
designed films and packaging equipment to centrally package meat and poultry products prior to shipment to the supermarket. Case ready packages are virtually ready for the meat case upon arrival at
the retail store.

Protective and Specialty Packaging Products

The Company's protective and specialty packaging products include its cushioning and surface protection products and certain other products. The Company's
protective and specialty packaging products and systems are primarily sold to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The products in this segment enable the end users to
provide a high degree of protection in packaging their items by means of cushioning or surface protection, or a combination thereof, as well as void fill.

Cushioning and Surface Protection Products

The Company manufactures and markets Bubble Wrap® and AirCap® air cellular packaging materials, which consist of air encapsulated between
two layers of plastic film, each containing a barrier layer to retard air loss, that form a pneumatic cushion to protect products from damage through shock or vibration during shipment. The
Company's performance shrink films are sold for non-food product display and merchandising applications. These films are used to "shrink-wrap" a wide assortment of industrial
and consumer products. The Company's Instapak® polyurethane foam packaging systems (which consist of proprietary blends of polyurethane chemicals, high performance polyolefin films and
specially designed dispensing equipment) provide protective packaging for a wide variety of products. CelluPlank® plank foams and Stratocell® laminated polyethylene foams are
generally sold by the Company to fabricators and converters. The Company also manufactures thin polyethylene foams in roll and sheet form under the trademarks Cell-Aire® and
Cellu-Cushion®. Korrvu® packaging is the Company's suspension and retention packaging offering. The Company's insulation products are made with foil-faced air
cellular materials. The Company also offers sterilized medical bags and films for use with medical products.

The
Company manufactures and markets Jiffy® protective mailers and other durable mailers and bags that are made in several standard sizes and are used for mailing or shipping
a wide variety of items. The Company's protective mailers include lightweight, tear-resistant paper mailers marketed under various trademarks, including Jiffylite® and Mail
Lite®, lined with air cellular cushioning material. These products also include the widely used Jiffy® padded mailers made from recycled kraft paper padded with macerated
recycled newspaper. The Company's durable mailers and bags, made of plastic, are marketed under the ShurTuff®, Trigon®, Lab Pak®, Keepsafe™ and
Tuffgard® trademarks. The Company also manufactures and sells paper packaging products under the trademarks Kushion Kraft®, Custom Wrap™, Jiffy
Packaging®, Padwrap® and Void Kraft™.

The
Company offers inflatable packaging systems, including its Rapid Fill® system, which consists of a compact, portable inflator and self-sealing inflatable
plastic bags, and its Fill-Air™ system, which converts rolls of polyethylene film into continuous perforated chains of air-filled cushions. The Company produces and
markets converting systems that convert certain of the Company's packaging materials, including air cellular cushioning materials, thin polyethylene foam and paper packaging materials, into
sheets of a pre-selected size and quantity or, for the Company's recycled kraft paper, into paper dunnage material. The Company also offers shrink-wrap equipment for use with
shrink films.


Other Products

The Company manufactures and sells a number of other products, including specialty adhesive tapes, solar collectors and covers for swimming pools, and certain
products related to the elimination and neutralization of static electricity. Also, the Company manufactures recycled kraft paper as well as loose-fill polystyrene packaging.

Foreign Operations

The Company operates in the United States and in 46 other countries, and its products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world.
In maintaining its foreign operations, the Company is exposed to risks inherent in such operations, including those of currency fluctuations. Information on currency exchange risks is incorporated by
reference in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financial information about geographic areas, including net sales and total long-lived assets, for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001 appears in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Marketing, Distribution and Customers

The Company employs over 2,500 sales and marketing personnel in the countries in which it operates, who market the Company's products through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters
as well as directly to end users. In the United States and certain other countries, the Company has separate sales and marketing groups for many of its product lines. These groups often work together
to develop market opportunities for the Company's products.

To
support the Company's food packaging customers, the Company has food science laboratories in a number of locations that assist customers in identifying the appropriate food packaging
materials and systems to meet their needs. The Company also offers customized graphic design services to its food packaging and mailer customers.

To
assist its marketing efforts for its protective and specialty packaging products and to provide specialized customer services, the Company maintains packaging laboratories in many of
its United States and foreign facilities. These laboratories are staffed by professional packaging engineers and equipped with drop-testing and other equipment used to develop and test
cost-effective package designs to meet the particular protective and specialty packaging requirements of each customer.

The
Company has no material long-term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2001, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for as much as 10% of
the Company's consolidated net sales.

Although
net sales of both food packaging products and protective and specialty packaging products tend to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider
seasonality to be material to its consolidated business.

Competition

Competition for most of the Company's packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging
technology, the Company's ongoing research and development programs are intended to enable the Company to maintain technological leadership. Certain companies producing competing products are well
established and may have greater financial resources than the Company.

There
are a number of competing manufacturers of food packaging products, including companies offering similar products that operate on a global basis, as well as those that operate in a
region or single country. Competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic,


paper, metals and other materials. The Company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which it
offers those products and one of the leading suppliers of absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and poultry processors in the United States.

The
Company's protective and specialty packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that are used to
provide protection against damage to the packaged product during its shipment and storage. Competitive materials include various forms of paper packaging products, expanded plastics, corrugated die
cuts, loosefill packaging materials, strapping, envelopes, reinforced bags, boxes and other containers, and various corrugated materials. Heavy-duty applications of the Company's
Instapak® packaging and its plank and laminated foam products also compete with various types of molded foam plastics, fabricated
foam plastics and mechanical shock mounts and with wood blocking and bracing systems. The Company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a
barrier layer, shrink films for industrial and commercial applications, protective mailers, and polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the geographic areas in which it sells
these products.

Raw Materials

The raw materials utilized in the Company's operations generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several
suppliers. Some materials used in the Company's protective packaging products are reprocessed from scrap generated in the Company's manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in
recycling programs. The principal raw materials used in the Company's food packaging products include polyolefin and other resins and films, paper and wood pulp products and blowing agents used in
foam packaging products. The principal raw materials used in the Company's protective and specialty packaging products include raw materials similar to those used in its food packaging products, as
well as polyurethane chemicals. The Company also offers a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment, some of which it manufactures (or has manufactured to its specifications), some of which it
assembles and some of which it purchases from other suppliers.

Product Development

The Company maintains a continuing effort to develop new products and improvements to its existing products and processes as well as new packaging and
non-packaging applications for its products. From time to time the Company also acquires promising new packaging designs or techniques developed by others and commercializes them. In
recent years, the Company has instituted ongoing programs of joint research and development projects combining the technical capabilities of its food packaging operations and its protective and
specialty packaging operations. The Company incurred expenses of $55,779,000 related to Company-sponsored research and development in 2001, compared with $54,264,000 during 2000, and $56,452,000
during 1999.

Patents and Licenses

The Company is the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of its products,
manufacturing processes and equipment. The Company's patents, licenses and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. No single patent or license alone, however, provides the Company
with such an advantage. Rather, the Company believes that its success depends primarily on its marketing, engineering and manufacturing skills and on its ongoing research and development efforts. The
Company believes that the expiration or unenforceability of any of such patents, applications or licenses would not be material to the Company's business or financial position.


Environmental Matters

The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities in which it operates
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. The Company believes that compliance with current environmental laws and
regulations has not had a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures or financial position.

In
some jurisdictions in which the Company's packaging products are sold or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate, among other things, recycled
or reprocessed content, sale or disposal of packaging materials. In addition, customer demand for packaging materials that are viewed as being "environmentally responsible" and that minimize the
generation of solid waste continues to evolve. While these issues can be a competitive factor in the marketplace for packaging materials, the Company maintains active programs designed to comply with
these laws and regulations, to monitor their evolution, and to meet such customer demand.

The
Company also supports its customers' interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for certain of the Company's products or product packaging and
for materials used in certain of the Company's products, and, when possible, materials collected through these collection programs are reprocessed and either reused in the Company's protective
packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products.

Employees

At December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately 17,700 employees worldwide.

Item 2. Properties

The Company's food packaging products are produced in 49 manufacturing facilities (14 in North America, 13 in Europe, 6 in Latin America, 15 in the Asia Pacific
region, and 1 in South Africa). Protective and specialty packaging products are produced in 74 manufacturing facilities (33 in North America, 18 in Europe, 7 in Latin America, 14 in the Asia Pacific
region, and 2 in South Africa). A number of the Company's manufacturing facilities serve both segments. The Company occupies other
facilities containing sales, distribution, technical, warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the United States and in various foreign countries.

In
the United States, the Company's food packaging products are manufactured at facilities in California, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina
and Texas. Its protective and specialty packaging products are manufactured at facilities in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Because of the light but voluminous nature of the Company's air cellular, polyethylene foam and protective mailer products, significant
freight savings are realized by locating manufacturing facilities for these products near customers. To realize the benefit of such savings, the Company has facilities for manufacturing these products
in various locations in proximity to customers.

The
Company owns the large majority of its manufacturing facilities, certain of which are owned subject to mortgages or similar financing arrangements. The balance of the Company's
manufacturing facilities are located in leased premises. The Company's manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings in which the Company's specialized machinery for the
manufacture of one or more products is contained. The Company believes that its manufacturing facilities are well maintained, suitable for their purposes, and adequate for the Company's needs.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On March 31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction (the "Cryovac Transaction"), which brought the Cryovac packaging business and
the former Sealed Air Corporation ("old Sealed Air") under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As
part of that transaction, the Cryovac packaging business, held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, was separated from the remaining businesses of the Company. Such remaining
businesses were then contributed to a company now known as W. R. Grace & Co. ("New Grace"), whose shares were distributed to the Company's stockholders. As a result, New Grace became a separate
publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into old
Sealed Air, which changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation (US). The agreements pursuant to which the Cryovac Transaction was carried out are referred to below as the "Transaction Agreements."

In
connection with the Cryovac Transaction, New Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac Transaction, whether accruing or
occurring before or after the Cryovac Transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac's operations. The liabilities retained by New Grace include, among others, liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by New Grace's subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac Transaction, including its primary U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R.
Grace & Co.-Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of New Grace since the Cryovac Transaction. The Transaction Agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to
hold the Company, including any of its subsidiaries, responsible for liabilities of New Grace or its subsidiaries, including such asbestos-related liabilities, New Grace and its subsidiaries would
indemnify and defend the Company.

Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac Transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos
liabilities of New Grace and its subsidiaries, certain of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. These actions include several purported class actions and a
number of personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic
insulation product. Neither old Sealed Air nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has been resolved
through judgment, settlement or otherwise. All such cases have been stayed in connection with New Grace's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding discussed below.

While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac Transaction was a
fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against New Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for
liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac Transaction by W. R. Grace & Co.-Conn., or other New Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a fraudulent
transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a business
for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it
was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If any transfers in connection with the Cryovac Transaction were found by a court to be fraudulent transfers, the Company could be
required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund certain liabilities of New Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos
claimants.


In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac Transaction, both Sealed Air and Grace stated that it was their belief that New
Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac Transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac Transaction
would be a fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac Transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards reached
conclusions adverse to the Company, such determination could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position.

On
April 2, 2001, New Grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. New Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999.

In
connection with its Chapter 11 filing, New Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company related to
alleged asbestos liabilities of New Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May 3, 2001, which was modified on January 22,
2002, under which all such filed or pending actions against the Company were stayed and all such future actions are stayed upon filing and service on the Company. No further proceedings involving the
Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. The Company believes that New Grace's filing for reorganization may provide a single forum in
which all such claims might be resolved.

Committees
appointed in New Grace's bankruptcy case have sought the court's permission to pursue fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and against Fresenius, as discussed below.
The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace & Co.-Conn.
Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March 2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Fresenius transaction and the solvency of New Grace
following the Cryovac Transaction and whether the transferor received reasonably equivalent value in such transactions would be tried on behalf of all creditors of New Grace starting on
September 30, 2002. The Company believes that the Cryovac Transaction was not a fraudulent transfer and the Company intends to defend its interests vigorously.

During
2001, the Company paid approximately $8,000,000, unrelated to the asbestos and fraudulent transfer claims described above, which was primarily a result of the Company's guarantee,
entered into at the time of the Cryovac Transaction, of certain debt payable by W. R. Grace & Co.-Conn., which filed for reorganization along with New Grace.

In
January 2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and certain of
its affiliates (collectively, "Fresenius") in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. Fresenius contends that the Company is obligated to indemnify
Fresenius for certain liabilities that Fresenius may incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. Fresenius's contention is based on its interpretation of the agreements
between Fresenius and W. R. Grace & Co.-Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February 2002, Fresenius announced that it had accrued a charge of $172,000,000 for
such potential liabilities, which include pre-transaction tax liabilities of New Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from New Grace's Chapter 11 filing. The Company
believes that it is not responsible to indemnify Fresenius under the 1996 agreements and has filed the action in order to proceed to a resolution of Fresenius's claims. However, if the court were to
rule against the Company and if Fresenius were to incur a material liability subject to an indemnification obligation, then the outcome of the action could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated results of operations and financial position. The action is in its early stages, and Fresenius has not yet responded to the complaint.


In
view of New Grace's Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that New Grace had agreed to retain in the
Cryovac Transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company.

Under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, an accrual for a contingent liability is appropriate only if it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and if the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not believe that these conditions have been met with respect to the claims against the Company related to the
alleged asbestos liabilities, the fraudulent transfer claims or the Fresenius indemnification matter, all of which are described above. Accordingly, the Company has not made any accrual for these
matters as of December 31, 2001.

Final
determinations and accountings under the Transaction Agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the Cryovac Transaction had not been completed at the time of New Grace's
Chapter 11 filing. The Company expects to file a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding that will include all of the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that New Grace agreed to
retain or that are subject to indemnification by New Grace under the Transaction Agreements, less certain amounts that the Company is responsible for under the Transaction Agreements. Costs and
liabilities for which the Company intends to seek indemnification by New Grace will include certain defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims, the
guaranteed debt paid by the Company described above, any recovery by the creditors of New Grace if the Company were not successful in defending against the fraudulent transfer or asbestos claims
described above, any recovery by Fresenius if the Company were held liable to indemnify Fresenius and Fresenius were to incur an indemnifiable liability, or any of the other potential claims against
the Company mentioned above. The Company expects that its claim will be as an unsecured creditor of New Grace. It is not currently possible to determine the amount of the Company's claim against New
Grace or the amount of the Company's recovery, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding.

The
Company's worldwide operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations which, among other things, impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water
and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company reviews the effects of environmental laws and regulations on its operations and believes that
it is in substantial compliance with all material applicable environmental laws and regulations.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company was a party to, or otherwise involved in, several federal and state government environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the
cleanup of Superfund or other sites. The Company may have potential liability for investigation and clean up of certain of such sites. At most of such sites numerous companies, including the Company,
have been identified as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") under Superfund or related laws. It is the Company's policy to provide for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and if an amount which is within the estimated range of the costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies is reasonably estimable, without giving effect
to any possible future insurance proceeds. As assessments and cleanups proceed, these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional information becomes available. At
December 31, 2001, such environmental related provisions were not material. While it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters, based
upon the information currently available to the Company and its experience in dealing with such matters, the Company believes that its potential future liability with respect to such sites is not
material to the Company's results of operations or consolidated financial position.

The
Company is also involved in various other legal actions incidental to its business. Company management believes, after consulting with counsel, that the disposition of these other
legal


proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or consolidated financial position.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2001.
