PART I

Item 1.

Business

For over fifty years, Sealed Air Corporation has been a leading
    global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging
    and performance-based materials and equipment systems that serve
    an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications.
    As a leading provider in the applications we serve, we
    differentiate ourselves through our:

•

extensive global reach, by which we leverage our strengths
    across our 52-country footprint;

•

expertise in packaging sales, service, engineering and food
    science;

•

leading brands, such as our Bubble
    Wrap

®

brand cushioning,
    Jiffy

®

protective mailers,
    Instapak

®

foam-in-place

systems and
    Cryovac

®

packaging technology;

•

technology leadership with an emphasis on proprietary
    technologies; and

•

total systems offering that includes specialty materials,
    equipment systems and services.

Our operations generate approximately 54% of our revenue from
    outside the United States and approximately 16% of our revenue
    from developing regions. These developing regions are Africa,
    Central and Eastern Europe, China, Commonwealth of Independent
    States, India, Latin America, Middle East and Southeast Asia.

We conduct substantially all of our business through two direct
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air
    Corporation (US). These two subsidiaries, directly and
    indirectly, own substantially all of the assets of the business
    and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries
    around the world. Throughout this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

when we refer to “Sealed Air,” the
    “Company,” “we,” “us” or
    “our,” we are referring to Sealed Air Corporation and
    all of our subsidiaries, except where the context indicates
    otherwise. Also, when we cross reference to a “Note,”
    we are referring to our “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements,” unless the context indicates otherwise.

Our
    Business Strategies

Our business is growth oriented, with goals of 5% to 6% average
    annual organic sales growth (volume and product price/mix) and a
    15% operating profit margin by the 2012/2013 timeframe.

The key strategic priorities developed to achieve these goals
    are:

•

Innovation leadership with ongoing solution and service
    development:

We continue to expand our presence
    in both existing and new end market applications by focusing on
    innovative solutions that bring measurable value to our
    customers and to end-consumers. Our distinctive systems approach
    accommodates ongoing innovation in differentiated materials,
    products and equipment systems, as well as integrated packaging
    solutions and other services.

•

Growth in developing regions:

With an
    international focus and extensive geographic footprint, we will
    leverage our broad portfolio and strengths in innovation to grow
    in developing regions. Urbanization, global trade, increased
    protein consumption and the conversion to safe and hygienic
    packaged goods are key secular trends present in developing
    regions.

•

Focus on cash flow and return on assets:

We
    focus on generating substantial operating cash flow so that we
    may continue investing in innovative research and development in
    the business and its strategies, and return capital to
    stockholders.

•

Optimize processes and operations to maximize
    profitability:

We are focused on deriving greater
    supply chain efficiencies by leveraging scale, optimizing
    processes and reducing complexity and costs.

•

Sustainability:

Our global
    Smartlife

tm

initiative highlights our focus and dedication to responsible
    management of our business, to minimizing risks and being good
    stewards of the environment and to the communities we live in
    and serve. We focus on source reduction, recyclability and the
    growing use of



renewable content, as well as efficient use of energy and other
    resources through the entire life cycle of our products: from
    in-house manufacturing through to the waste stream.

•

Develop our people:

A core strength is our
    people. We will grow our business through ongoing development of
    key skills in a diverse workforce that abides by our Code of
    Conduct.

Segments

We report our business publicly in four parts: three reportable
    segments and an “Other” category.

Our reportable segments are:

1. Food Packaging;

2. Food Solutions; and

3. Protective Packaging, which includes Shrink Packaging.

Our Other category includes:

(a) Specialty Materials;

(b) Medical Applications; and

(c) New Ventures.

Information concerning our reportable segments, including net
    sales, depreciation and amortization, operating profit and
    assets, appears in Note 3, “Segments”.

Descriptions
    of the Reportable Segments and Other Category

We offer a broad range of solutions across leading brands
    worldwide. Approximately 60% of our total net sales in each of
    the three years ended December 31, 2010 were in our food
    businesses, while approximately 30% of our total net sales were
    in our industrial packaging businesses (Protective Packaging
    segment and Specialty Materials business). The balance of our
    net sales has been primarily in our Medical Applications
    business.

Food
    Packaging

In this segment, we focus on the automated packaging of
    perishable foods, predominantly fresh and processed meats and
    cheeses. Our products are sold primarily to food processors,
    distributors, supermarket retailers and foodservice businesses.
    We market these products mostly under the
    Cryovac

®

trademark. This segment’s growth opportunities are targeted
    toward developments in technologies that enable our customers to
    package and ship their meat and cheese products effectively
    through their supply chain. These technologies focus on
    automation and packaging integration solutions, innovation in
    material science and expansion of the sale of our products into
    developing regions, where consumers continue to increase their
    protein consumption and are transitioning to packaged products.

Our Food Packaging segment offerings include:

•

shrink bags to vacuum package many fresh food products,
    including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and seafood, as well as

    prepared, high-quality meals, either from foodservice outlets or
    from expanding retail cases at grocery stores. We sell the
    products in this reportable segment primarily to food
    processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and foodservice
    businesses. Our trademarks in this segment include
    Cryovac

Outsourced
    Products

Approximately 17% of the products we sell in this segment are
    fabricated by other manufacturers and are referred to as
    outsourced products. The largest category of outsourced products
    is foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated in
    North America, Europe and Asia. We also outsource the
    manufacture of selected equipment. We have strategically opted
    to use third-party manufacturers for technically less complex
    products in order to offer customers a broader range of
    solutions. We have benefited from this strategy with increased
    net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital
    expenditures. See “Outsourced Products,” included in
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further
    information. Our Food Packaging and Protective Packaging
    segments also sell outsourced products, but they represent a
    much smaller percent of their revenue.

Protective
    Packaging

This segment comprises our core protective packaging
    technologies and solutions aimed at traditional industrial
    applications as well as consumer-oriented packaging solutions.
    We aggregate our protective packaging products and shrink
    packaging products into our Protective Packaging segment for
    reporting purposes. We sell products in this segment primarily
    to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of
    industries as well as to retailers and to

e-commerce

and mail order fulfillment firms. This segment’s growth is
    focused on providing a broader range of protective packaging
    products and solutions worldwide by focusing on advancements in
    material science, automation, and the development of reliable

    the development of comprehensive systems solutions. We also
    provide field technical services to our customers worldwide.
    These services include system installation, integration and
    monitoring systems, repair and upgrade, operator training in the
    efficient use of packaging systems, qualification of various
    consumable and system combinations, and packaging line layout
    and design.

Our Medical Applications business offers two cleanroom contract
    assembly and packaging facilities in two countries, as well as a
    packaging validation lab. We also operate two equipment and
    medical device packaging labs in two countries that support
    customers’ package design needs and packaging equipment
    systems.

We have no material long-term contracts for the distribution of
    our products. In 2010, no customer or affiliated group of
    customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net
    sales.

Seasonality

Historically, net sales in our food businesses have tended to be
    slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards
    the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to
    holiday events. Our Protective Packaging segment has tended to
    also be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during
    the

“back-to-school”

season in the mid-third quarter and through the fourth quarter
    due to the holiday shopping season.



Competition

Competition for most of our packaging products is based
    primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and
    price. Since competition is also based upon innovations in
    packaging technology, we maintain ongoing research and
    development programs to enable us to maintain technological
    leadership. We invest approximately double the industry average
    on research and development as a percentage of net sales per
    year. There are also other companies producing competing
    products that are well-established.

There are other manufacturers of food packaging and food
    solutions products, some of which are companies offering similar
    products that operate across regions and others that operate in
    a single region or single country. Competing manufacturers
    produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic,
    metals and other materials. We believe that we are one of the
    leading suppliers of (i) flexible food packaging materials
    and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which
    we offer those products, (ii) barrier trays for case-ready
    meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we
    offers those trays, and (iii) absorbent pads for food
    products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in
    the United States.

Our protective packaging products compete with similar products
    made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging
    materials that customers use to provide protection against
    damage to their products during shipment and storage. Among the
    competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging
    products, expanded plastics, corrugated die cuts, strapping,
    envelopes, reinforced bags, boxes and other containers, and
    various corrugated materials, as well as various types of molded
    foam plastics, fabricated foam plastics, mechanical shock
    mounts, and wood blocking and bracing systems. We believe that
    we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning
    materials containing a barrier layer, inflatable packaging,
    suspension and retention packaging, shrink films for industrial
    and commercial applications, protective mailers, polyethylene
    foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal
    geographic areas in which we sell these products.

Competition in specialty materials is focused on performance
    characteristics and price. Competition for most of our medical
    applications products is based primarily on performance
    characteristics, service and price. Technical design capability
    is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging
    offered by the Medical Applications business.

Raw
    Materials

Our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other
    petrochemical-based resins and films, and paper and wood pulp
    products. These raw materials represent approximately one-third
    of our consolidated cost of goods sold. We also purchase
    corrugated materials, cores for rolls of products such as films
    and Bubble
    Wrap

®

brand cushioning, inks for printed materials, and blowing agents
    used in the expansion of foam packaging products. In addition,
    we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment, some
    of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our
    specifications, some of which we assemble and some of which we
    purchase from suppliers.

The raw materials for our products generally have been readily
    available on the open market and in most cases are available
    from several suppliers. However, we have some sole-source
    suppliers, and the lack of availability of supplies could have a
    material negative impact on our business. Natural disasters such
    as hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist
    activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery
    capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical
    suppliers in the future. These factors could lead to increased
    prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies and
    allocation of raw materials by our suppliers. We source some
    materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled
    in our manufacturing operations or obtained through
    participation in recycling programs.

Sourcing

We have a centralized supply chain organization, which includes
    the centralized management of procurement and logistic
    activities. Our objective is to leverage our global scale to
    achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered
    cost across all our regions. We do this while adhering to
    strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices.



Research
    and Development Activities

We maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and
    improve our existing products and processes, including
    developing new packaging and non-packaging applications using
    our intellectual property. From time to time, we also acquire
    and commercialize new packaging and other products or techniques
    developed by others. Our research and development projects rely
    on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science,
    materials science, package design and equipment engineering. We
    spent $88 million in 2010, $81 million in 2009 and
    $86 million in 2008 on research and development.

Patents
    and Trademarks

We are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 2,500
    United States and foreign patents and patent applications, as
    well as an aggregate of over 3,000 United States and foreign
    trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate
    to many of our products, manufacturing processes and equipment.
    We believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide
    a competitive advantage. As such, each year we continue to file,
    in the aggregate, an average of 200 United States and foreign
    patent applications and 200 United States and foreign trademark
    applications. None of our reportable segments is dependent upon
    any single patent or trademark alone. Rather, we believe that
    our success depends primarily on our sales and service,
    marketing, engineering and manufacturing skills and on our
    ongoing research and development efforts. We believe that the
    expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents,
    applications, licenses or trademark registrations would not be
    material to our business or consolidated financial position.

Environmental,
    Health and Safety Matters

As a manufacturer, we are subject to various laws, rules and
    regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities in
    which we operate. These cover: the safe storage and use of raw
    materials and production chemicals; the release of materials
    into the environment; standards for the treatment, storage and
    disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; or otherwise relate to
    the protection of the environment. We review environmental,
    health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our
    operations and believe that compliance with current
    environmental and workplace health and safety laws and
    regulations has not had a material effect on our capital
    expenditures or consolidated financial position.

In some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold
    or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that
    seek to regulate, among other things, minimum levels of recycled
    or reprocessed content and, more generally, the sale or disposal
    of packaging materials. In addition, customer demand continues
    to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable
    materials or that are otherwise viewed as being
    “environmentally sound.” Our new venture activities,
    described above, include the development of packaging products
    from renewable resources. We maintain programs designed to
    comply with these laws and regulations, to monitor their
    evolution, and to meet this customer demand. One advantage
    inherent in many of our products is that thin, lightweight
    packaging solutions reduce waste and transportation costs in
    comparison to available alternatives. We continue to evaluate
    and implement new technologies in this area as they become
    available.

We also support our customers’ interests in eliminating
    waste by offering or participating in collection programs for
    some of our products or product packaging and for materials used
    in some of our products. When possible, materials collected
    through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in our
    protective packaging operations or offered to other
    manufacturers for use in other products. In addition, gains that
    we have made in internal recycling programs have allowed us to
    improve our net raw material yield, thus mitigating the impact
    of resin costs, while lowering solid waste disposal costs and
    controlling environmental liability risks associated with waste
    disposal.

Our emphasis on environmental, health and safety compliance
    provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings
    through asset protection and protection of employees, for which
    we are recognized as leaders in our industry. Our website,

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Introduction

Investors should carefully consider the risks described below
    before making an investment decision. These are the most
    significant risk factors; however, they are not the only risk
    factors that you should consider in making an investment
    decision.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

also contains and may incorporate by reference from our Proxy
    Statement for our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or from
    exhibits, forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties. See the “Cautionary Notice Regarding
    Forward-Looking Statements” below. Our actual results could
    differ materially from those anticipated in these
    forward-looking statements as a result of many factors,
    including the risks that we face, which are described below and
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

or in documents incorporated by reference in this report.

Our business, consolidated financial position or results of
    operations could be materially adversely affected by any of
    these risks. The trading price of our securities could decline
    due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may
    lose all or part of their investment.

Weakened
    global economic conditions have had and could continue to have
    an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

Weakened global economic conditions have had and may continue to
    have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net
    sales due to weakened demand, unfavorable changes in product
    price/mix, or lower profit margins.

During periods of economic recession, there can be a heightened
    competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling
    prices. If we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling
    prices significantly, then there could be a negative impact on
    our consolidated revenue, profitability and cash flows.

Also, reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the
    ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds
    for operations and capital expenditures. This could negatively
    impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our
    sales of materials and equipment to affected customers. This
    also could result in reduced or delayed collections of
    outstanding accounts receivable.

The
    global nature of our operations in the United States and in 51
    foreign countries exposes us to numerous risks that could
    materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations.

We operate in the United States and in 51 other countries, and
    our products are distributed in those countries as well as in
    other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing
    operations are located outside of the United States.
    Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations
    in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not
    be present or as significant for our U.S. operations.
    Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which
    we operate, including developing regions, could result in the
    disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our
    operations in those areas.

Risks inherent in our international operations include social
    plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain
    restructuring actions; exchange controls; foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations including devaluations; the potential
    for changes in local economic conditions including local
    inflationary pressures; restrictive governmental actions such as
    those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection
    matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and
    prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;
    changes in laws and regulations,



including the laws and policies of the United States affecting
    trade and foreign investment; the difficulty of enforcing
    agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign
    legal systems; variations in protection of intellectual property
    and other legal rights; more expansive legal rights of foreign
    unions or works councils; the potential for nationalization of
    enterprises or facilities; and unsettled political conditions
    and possible terrorist attacks against United States or other
    interests. In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies
    in repatriating funds from our

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
    our international operations and, consequently, on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

If the
    settlement of the asbestos-related claims that we have agreed to
    (the “Settlement agreement”) is not implemented, we
    will not be released from the various asbestos-related,
    fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and indemnification
    claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with W.
    R. Grace & Co. We are also a defendant in a number of
    asbestos-related actions in Canada arising from W. R.
    Grace & Co.’s activities in Canada prior to the
    1998 transaction.

On November 27, 2002, we reached an agreement in principle
    with the Official Committee of Asbestos Personal Injury
    Claimants (the “ACC”) and the Official Committee of
    Asbestos Property Damage Claimants appointed to represent
    asbestos claimants in the W. R. Grace & Co.
    (“Grace”) bankruptcy case to resolve all current and
    future asbestos-related claims made against us and our
    affiliates. The Settlement agreement will also resolve the
    fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims, as
    well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care
    Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies in connection with the
    Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction was a multi-step
    transaction, completed on March 31, 1998, which brought the
    Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air
    Corporation’s business under the common ownership of the
    Company. The parties to the agreement in principle signed the
    definitive Settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003
    consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. On
    June 27, 2005, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
    District of Delaware, where the Grace bankruptcy case is
    pending, signed an order approving the definitive Settlement
    agreement. Although Grace is not a party to the Settlement
    agreement, under the terms of the order, Grace is directed to
    comply with the Settlement agreement subject to limited
    exceptions. On September 19, 2008, Grace, the ACC, the
    Asbestos PI Future Claimants’ Representative (the
    “FCR”), and the Official Committee of Equity Security
    Holders (the “Equity Committee”) filed, as
    co-proponents, a plan of reorganization (as filed and amended
    from time to time, the “PI Settlement Plan”) and
    several exhibits and associated documents, including a
    disclosure statement (as filed and amended from time to time,
    the “PI Settlement Disclosure Statement”), with the
    Bankruptcy Court. As filed, the PI Settlement Plan would provide
    for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under
    Section 524(g) of the United States Bankruptcy Code to
    which present and future asbestos-related claims would be
    channeled. The PI Settlement Plan also contemplates that the
    terms of our definitive Settlement agreement will be
    incorporated into the PI Settlement Plan and that we will pay
    the amount contemplated by that agreement.

On January 31, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court entered a
    memorandum opinion (the “Memorandum Opinion”)
    overruling certain objections to the PI Settlement Plan. On the
    same date, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order regarding
    confirmation of the PI Settlement Plan (the “Confirmation
    Order”). As entered on January 31, 2011, the
    Confirmation Order contained recommended findings of fact and
    conclusions of law, and recommended that the U.S. District
    Court for the District of Delaware (the “District
    Court”) approve the Confirmation Order, and that the
    District Court confirm the PI Settlement Plan and issue a
    channeling injunction under Section 524(g) of the
    Bankruptcy Code. Thereafter, on February 15, 2011, the
    Bankruptcy Court issued an order clarifying its Memorandum
    Opinion and Confirmation Order (the “Clarifying
    Order”). Among other things, the Clarifying Order provided
    that any references in the Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation
    Order to a recommendation that the District Court confirm the PI
    Settlement Plan were thereby amended to make clear that the PI
    Settlement Plan was confirmed and that the Bankruptcy Court was
    requesting that the District Court issue and affirm the
    Confirmation Order including the injunction under
    Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.

If it becomes effective, the PI Settlement Plan may implement
    the terms of the Settlement agreement, but there can be no
    assurance that this will be the case notwithstanding the
    Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation of the PI Settlement Plan.
    The terms of the PI Settlement Plan remain subject to amendment.
    Moreover, the PI Settlement Plan is subject to the satisfaction
    of a number of conditions which are more fully set forth in the
    PI Settlement Plan



and include, without limitation, the availability of exit
    financing and the approval of the PI Settlement Plan by the
    District Court. Additionally, various parties have filed notices
    of appeal or have otherwise challenged the Memorandum Opinion
    and Confirmation Order, and the PI Settlement Plan may be
    subject to further appeal or challenge by additional parties.
    Parties filed a number of objections to the PI Settlement Plan,
    and some of these objections concerned injunctions, releases and
    provisions as applied to us

and/or

that
    are contemplated by the Settlement agreement. Such parties (or
    others) may appeal or otherwise challenge the Bankruptcy
    Court’s Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation Order, or
    otherwise continue to oppose the PI Settlement Plan.

While the Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the PI Settlement Plan,
    additional proceedings may be held before the District Court or
    other courts to consider matters related to the PI Settlement
    Plan. We do not know whether or when a final plan of
    reorganization will become effective. Assuming that a final plan
    of reorganization (whether the PI Settlement Plan or another
    plan of reorganization) is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court,
    approved by the District Court, and does become effective, we do
    not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be
    consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement and if the
    other conditions to our obligation to pay the Settlement
    agreement amount will be met. If these conditions are not
    satisfied or not waived by us, we will not be obligated to pay
    the amount contemplated by the Settlement agreement. However, if
    we do not pay the Settlement agreement amount, we and our
    affiliates will not be released from the various claims against
    us.

If the Settlement agreement does not become effective, either
    because Grace fails to emerge from bankruptcy or because Grace
    does not emerge from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization
    that is consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement,
    then we and our affiliates will not be released from the various
    asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and
    indemnification claims made against us and our affiliates noted
    above, and all of these claims would remain pending and would
    have to be resolved through other means, such as through
    agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials. In that
    case, we could face liabilities that are significantly different
    from our obligations under the Settlement agreement. We cannot
    estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude
    may be. In the event these liabilities are materially larger
    than the current existing obligations, they could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations.

Since November 2004, the Company and specified subsidiaries have
    been named as defendants in a number of cases, including a
    number of putative class actions, brought in Canada as a result
    of Grace’s alleged marketing, manufacturing or distributing
    of asbestos or asbestos containing products in Canada prior to
    the Cryovac transaction in 1998. Grace has agreed to defend and
    indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases. The Canadian
    cases are currently stayed. A global settlement of these
    Canadian claims to be funded by Grace has been approved by the
    Canadian court, and the PI Settlement Plan provides for payment
    of these claims. We do not have any positive obligations under
    the Canadian settlement, but we are a beneficiary of the release
    of claims. The release in favor of the Grace parties (including
    us) will become operative upon the effective date of a plan of
    reorganization in Grace’s United States Chapter 11
    bankruptcy proceeding. As filed, the PI Settlement Plan
    contemplates that the claims released under the Canadian
    settlement will be subject to injunctions under
    Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. By its terms, the
    Canadian settlement will, unless amended, become null and void
    if a confirmation order in the Grace U.S. bankruptcy
    proceeding is not granted prior to July 31, 2011. As
    indicated above, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation
    Order on January 31, 2011 and the Clarifying Order on
    February 15, 2011; however, we can give no assurance that
    the PI Settlement Plan (or any other plan of reorganization)
    will be approved by the District Court, or will become
    effective. Assuming that a final plan of reorganization (whether
    the PI Settlement Plan or another plan of reorganization) is
    confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, approved by the District
    Court, and does become effective, if the final plan of
    reorganization does not incorporate the terms of the Canadian
    settlement or if the Canadian courts refuse to enforce the final
    plan of reorganization in the Canadian courts, and if in
    addition Grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us
    and our subsidiaries in these cases, then we could be required
    to pay substantial damages, which we cannot estimate at this
    time and which could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

For further information concerning these matters, see
    Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption
    “Cryovac Transaction Commitments and Contingencies.”



A
    downgrade of our credit ratings could have a negative impact on
    our costs and ability to access credit markets.

Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may
    be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating
    agencies review periodically. The Company and our long-term
    senior unsecured debt are currently rated BB+ (positive outlook)
    by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC. On
    November 18, 2010, Standard & Poor’s revised
    our ratings outlook to positive from stable. This rating is
    considered non-investment grade. The Company and our long-term
    senior unsecured debt are currently rated Baa3 by Moody’s
    Investor Service, Inc. This rating is considered investment
    grade. On May 4, 2010, Moody’s revised our ratings
    outlook to stable from negative. If our credit ratings are
    downgraded, there could be a negative impact on our ability to
    access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A
    credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any
    time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated
    independently of any other rating.

Raw
    material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as
    well as energy-related costs may negatively impact our results
    of operations, including our profit margins.

We use petrochemical-based raw materials to manufacture many of
    our products. Increases in market demand or fluctuations in the
    global trade for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy
    could increase our costs. We also have some sole-source
    suppliers, and the lack of availability of supplies could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition
    and results of operations.

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as political
    instability and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the
    production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural
    gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future. These factors
    could lead to increased prices for our raw materials,
    curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our
    suppliers, which could reduce revenues and profit margins and
    harm relations with our customers and which could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition
    and results of operations.

The
    effects of animal and food-related health issues such as bovine
    spongiform encephalopathy, also known as “mad cow”
    disease,

foot-and-mouth

disease and avian influenza or “bird-flu,” as well as
    other health issues affecting the food industry, may lead to
    decreased revenues.

We manufacture and sell food packaging products, among other
    products. Various health issues affecting the food industry have
    in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the
    sales of food packaging products. In recent years, occasional
    cases of mad cow disease have been confirmed and incidents of
    bird flu have surfaced in various countries. Outbreaks of animal
    diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of
    potentially affected animals and food products, leading to
    decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the
    culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal
    population otherwise intended for food supply. Also, consumers
    may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems
    with certain types of food. These factors may lead to reduced
    sales of food businesses’ products, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations.

Concerns
    about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change and the
    resulting governmental and market responses to these issues
    could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect
    our consolidated financial position and results of
    operations.

Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been
    enacted and proposed in response to concerns about GHG emissions
    and climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes
    petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our
    products, including plastic packaging materials. Increased
    environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher
    costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and
    energy costs. We could also incur additional compliance costs
    for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining
    permits. It is also possible that certain materials might cease
    to be permitted to be used in our processes.



Disruption
    and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect
    our external liquidity sources.

Our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations
    and amounts available under our existing lines of credit,
    including our global credit facility, our European credit
    facility, and our accounts receivable securitization program (as
    described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is included
    in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

Our accounts receivable securitization program includes a bank
    financing commitment that must be renewed annually prior to the
    expiration date. The bank commitment is scheduled to expire on
    December 2, 2011. While the bank is not obligated to renew
    the bank financing commitment, we have negotiated annual
    renewals since the commencement of the program in 2001.

Additionally, conditions in financial markets could affect
    financial institutions with which we have relationships and
    could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully
    our committed borrowing facilities. For example, a lender under
    our global credit facility or the European credit facility may
    be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request, and we may
    not be able to replace such lender.

Covenant
    restrictions under our credit arrangements may pose a
    risk.

We have a number of credit facilities, including our global
    credit facility, our European credit facility, and our accounts
    receivable securitization program, and debt securities we have
    issued, to manage liquidity and fund operations (as described in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations, which is included in Part II,
    Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

The agreements relating to these facilities and securities
    generally contain certain restrictive covenants, including the
    incurrence of additional indebtedness, restriction of liens and
    sale and leaseback transactions, financial covenants relating to
    interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity, and
    restrictions on consolidation and merger transactions, as well
    as, in some cases, restrictions on amendments to the Settlement
    agreement. In addition, amounts available under our accounts
    receivable securitization program can be impacted by a number of
    factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings,
    accounts receivable balances, the creditworthiness of our
    customers and our receivables collection experience. As a result
    of some of these factors, the amount available to us under the
    program has decreased. Although we do not believe that any of
    these covenants or other restrictive provisions presently
    materially restricts our liquidity position, a breach of one or
    more of the covenants or an event that triggers other
    restrictive provisions could result in material adverse
    consequences that could negatively impact our business,
    consolidated results of operations and financial position. This
    in turn could result in a further decline in amounts available
    under the accounts receivable securitization program or
    termination of the program. Such adverse consequences may
    include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of
    the facilities, triggering the obligation to redeem certain debt
    securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our
    lenders or the bank commitment related to our accounts
    receivable securitization program, refusal by lenders to extend
    further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter
    into new facilities, or the lowering or modification of our
    credit ratings.

Strengthening
    of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate
    fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations.

During 2010, approximately 54% of our sales originated outside
    the United States. We translate sales and other results
    denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our
    consolidated financial statements. During periods of a
    strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales
    and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may
    translate into fewer U.S. dollars.

Also, while we often produce in the same geographic markets as
    our products are sold, expenses are more concentrated in the
    United States compared with sales, so that in a time of
    strengthening of the U.S. dollar, our profit margins could
    be reduced. While we use financial instruments to hedge certain
    foreign currency exposures, this does not insulate us completely
    from foreign currency effects.

We have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to
    the currency devaluations in Venezuela and its designation as a
    highly inflationary economy under generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America, or
    U.S. GAAP, effective January 1, 2010. See
    “Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk,” of
    Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk,” for further discussion.



We may use financial instruments from time to time to manage
    exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which exposes us
    to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance. See
    Note 12, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,”
    for further discussion, which is contained in Part II,
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The
    full realization of our deferred tax assets, including primarily
    those related to the Settlement agreement may be affected by a
    number of factors.

We have deferred tax assets related to the Settlement agreement,
    other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes, foreign net
    operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances,
    employee benefit items, and other items. We have established
    valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an
    amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability
    to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our
    future operating results. We expect to realize these assets over
    an extended period. Consequently, changes in tax laws could
    cause actual results to differ from projections.

Our largest deferred tax asset relates to our Settlement
    agreement. The value of this asset, which was $368 million
    at December 31, 2010, may be affected by our tax situation
    at the time of the payment under the Settlement agreement as
    well as by the value of our common stock at that time. The
    deferred tax asset reflects the fair market value of
    18 million shares of our common stock at a post-split price
    of $17.86 per share based on the price when the Settlement
    agreement was reached in 2002. See Note 15, “Income
    Taxes,” for further discussion.

Our
    annual effective income tax rate can materially change as a
    result of changes in our U.S. and foreign mix of earnings and
    other factors including changes in tax laws and changes by
    regulatory authorities.

Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax
    expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However,
    income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global
    basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis.
    Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing
    audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect
    the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. For
    example, legislative proposals to change U.S. taxation of

non-U.S. earnings

could increase our effective tax rate. Also, changes in the mix
    of earnings between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the
    calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a
    significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate.

We
    experience competition in our operating segments and in the
    geographic areas in which we operate.

Our products compete with similar products made by other
    manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or
    products. We compete on the basis of performance characteristics
    of our products, as well as service, price and innovations in
    technology. A number of competing domestic and foreign companies
    are well-established. Our inability to maintain a competitive
    advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes,
    which would have a negative impact on our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations.

A
    slowing pipeline of new technologies and solutions at favorable
    margins could adversely affect our performance and prospects for
    future growth.

Our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to
    develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at
    favorable margins. The development and introduction cycle of new
    products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment.
    New products may not meet sales expectations or margin
    expectations due to many factors, including our inability to:
    (i) accurately predict demand, end-user preferences and
    evolving industry standards; (ii) resolve technical and
    technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner;
    or (iii) achieve manufacturing efficiencies.

A
    major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and
    distribution operations or our information systems and
    telecommunication resources could adversely affect our
    business.

If we experienced a natural disaster, such as a tornado,
    hurricane, earthquake or other severe weather event, or a
    casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood, at one of
    our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key
    supplier, our supply chain, or our information systems and
    telecommunication resources, then there could be a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.



The
    price of our common stock has on occasion experienced
    significant price and volume fluctuations. The sale of
    substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect
    the price of the common stock. One stockholder has beneficial
    ownership of approximately 32% of our common
    shares.

The market price of our common stock has experienced and may
    continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations
    greater than those experienced by the broader stock market. In
    addition, our announcements of our quarterly net earnings,
    future developments relating to the W. R. Grace & Co.
    bankruptcy, litigation, the effects of animal and food-related
    health issues, spikes in raw material and energy related costs,
    changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial
    markets and other developments affecting us, our customers,
    suppliers and competitors are among the events that could cause
    the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.

The sale or the availability for sale of a large number of
    shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely
    affect the price of the common stock. The Settlement agreement
    discussed above provides for the issuance of 18 million
    shares of our common stock. If this amount of common stock were
    to be sold in a relatively short period of trading, the sale
    could adversely affect the price of our common stock. See
    Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” under
    the caption “Cryovac Transaction Commitments and
    Contingencies” for further discussion.

According to a Schedule 13G/A filed with the SEC on
    February 14, 2011, Davis Selected Advisers, L.P. reported
    beneficial ownership of 51,458,302 shares, or approximately
    32%, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As such,
    Davis Selected Advisers has a significant voting block with
    respect to matters submitted to a stockholder vote, including
    the election of directors and the approval of potential business
    combination transactions.

While the Schedule 13G/A filed by Davis Selected Advisers, L.P.
    indicates that the beneficially owned shares of our common stock
    were not acquired for the purpose of changing or influencing the
    control of the Company, if this stockholder were to change its
    purpose for holding our common stock from investment to
    attempting to change or influence our management, this
    concentration of our common stock could potentially affect us
    and the price of our common stock.

Weakness
    in the financial and credit markets and other factors could
    potentially lead to the impairment of the carrying amount of our
    goodwill and other long-lived assets.

We have seven reporting units that are included in our segment
    reporting structure. The six reporting units with goodwill
    balances allocated to them are Food Packaging, Food Solutions,
    Protective Packaging, Shrink Packaging, Specialty Materials and
    Medical Applications.

We test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis
    annually during the fourth quarter of each year and at other
    times if events or circumstances exist that indicate the
    carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. During
    2010, we determined that there were no events or changes in
    circumstances that occurred that would indicate that the fair
    value of any of our reporting units may be below its carrying
    value.

Although we determined in 2010 that there were no events or
    changes in circumstances that occurred that would indicate that
    the fair value of any of our reporting units may be below its
    carrying value, the future occurrence of a potential indicator
    of impairment, such as: (i) a decrease in our expected net
    earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions;
    (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a
    decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant
    adverse change in legal factors or business climates;
    (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
    (vii) heightened competition; (viii) strategic
    decisions made in response to economic or competitive
    conditions; or (ix) a more-likely-than-not expectation that
    a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit
    will be sold or disposed of, could require an interim assessment
    for some or all of the reporting units before the next required
    annual assessment. In the event of significant adverse changes
    of the nature described above, we might have to recognize a
    non-cash impairment of goodwill, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.



Product
    liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect
    our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our
    brands.

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our
    products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In
    addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product
    liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative
    publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or
    adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell
    our products in certain jurisdictions. We could also be required
    to recall possibly defective products, which could result in
    adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain
    product liability insurance coverage, potential product
    liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits
    under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in
    increased costs for such coverage.

Our
    subsidiaries hold substantially all of our assets and conduct
    substantially all of our operations, and as a result we rely on
    distributions or advances from our subsidiaries.

We conduct substantially all of our business through two direct
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air
    Corporation (US). These two subsidiaries, directly and
    indirectly, own substantially all of the assets of our business
    and conduct operations themselves and through other subsidiaries
    around the globe. Therefore, we depend on distributions or
    advances from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and
    other obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of
    our common stock. Contractual provisions, laws or regulations to
    which we or any of our subsidiaries may become subject, tax
    inefficiencies and the financial condition and operating
    requirements of subsidiaries may reduce funds available for
    service of our indebtedness, dividends, and general corporate
    purposes.

Cautionary
    Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking
    statements so that investors can better understand a
    company’s future prospects and make informed investment
    decisions. Some of our statements in this report, in documents
    incorporated by reference into this report and in our future
    oral and written statements, may be forward-looking. These
    statements reflect our beliefs and expectations as to future
    events and trends affecting our business, our consolidated
    financial position and our results of operations. These
    forward-looking statements are based upon our current
    expectations concerning future events and discuss, among other
    things, anticipated future financial performance and future
    business plans. Forward-looking statements are identified by
    such words and phrases as “anticipates,”
    “assumes,” “believes,” “could be,”
    “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
    “may,” “plans to,” “will” and

Other
    Property Information

We own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities. Some
    of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing
    arrangements. We lease the balance of our manufacturing
    facilities, which are generally smaller sites. Our manufacturing
    facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that
    house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or
    more products. Because of the relatively low density of our air
    cellular, polyethylene foam and protective mailer products, we
    realize significant freight savings by locating our
    manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers
    and distributors.

We also occupy facilities containing sales, distribution,
    technical, warehouse or administrative functions at a number of
    locations in the United States and in many foreign countries.
    Some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites
    that we own and some on those that we lease. Stand-alone
    facilities of these types are generally leased. Our global
    headquarters are located in a leased property in Elmwood Park,
    New Jersey. For a list of those countries outside of the United
    States where we have operations, see “Foreign
    Operations” above. Our website,

www.sealedair.com

,
    contains additional information about our worldwide business.

We believe that our manufacturing, warehouse, office and other
    facilities are well maintained, suitable for their purposes and
    adequate for our needs.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

in Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,”
    under the caption “Cryovac Transaction Commitments and
    Contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference.

At December 31, 2010, we were a party to, or otherwise
    involved in, several federal, state and foreign environmental
    proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of
    “Superfund” sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
    and other sites. We may have potential liability for
    investigation and cleanup of some of these sites. It is our
    policy to accrue for environmental



cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been
    incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of
    costs associated with various alternative remediation
    strategies, without giving effect to any possible future
    insurance proceeds. As assessments and cleanups proceed, we
    review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as
    additional information becomes available. At December 31,
    2010, environmental related reserves were not material to our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations. While
    it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the
    future impact of environmental matters, based upon the
    information currently available to us and our experience in
    dealing with these matters, we believe that our potential future
    liability with respect to these sites is not material to our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

We are also involved in various other legal actions incidental
    to our business. We believe, after consulting with counsel, that
    the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters
    will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations.

On February 17, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on
    March 18, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of
    business on March 4, 2011. The estimated amount of this
    dividend payment is $21 million based on 159 million
    shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of
    January 31, 2011.

The dividend payments discussed above are recorded as reductions
    to cash and cash equivalents and retained earnings on our
    consolidated balance sheets. From time to time, we may consider
    other means of returning value to our stockholders based on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations. There
    is no guarantee that our Board of Directors will declare any
    further dividends.



Common
    Stock Performance Comparisons

The following graph shows, for the five years ended
    December 31, 2010, the cumulative total return on an
    investment of $100 assumed to have been made on
    December 31, 2005 in our common stock. The graph compares
    this return (“SEE”) with that of comparable
    investments assumed to have been made on the same date in:
    (a) the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index
    (“Composite S&P 500”); (b) a prior
    self-constructed peer group (“Peer Group 1”) and
    (c) an updated self-constructed peer group (“Peer
    Group 2”).

The prior Peer Group 1 includes us and the following other
    companies: Aptar Group Inc.; Avery Dennison Corporation; Ball
    Corporation; Bemis Company, Inc.; Crown Holdings, Inc.;
    MeadWestvaco Corporation; Pactiv Corporation (for 2005 through
    2009); Rexam PLC; Silgan Holdings Inc.; Sonoco Products Co.; and
    Spartech Corporation.

In 2010, we revised our peer group and designated it Peer Group
    2, which will replace Peer Group 1 beginning January 1,
    2011. We decided to utilize Peer Group 2 rather than Peer Group
    1 because we believe that Peer Group 2 more closely represents
    public companies in packaging and related industries that are
    comparable to us based on sales, total assets, numbers of
    employees and market capitalization. Further, the Organization
    and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, or
    Compensation Committee, will use this peer group to benchmark
    executive compensation going forward.

The updated Peer Group 2 includes us and the following
    companies: Avery Dennison Corporation; Ball Corporation; Bemis
    Company, Inc.; Crown Holdings, Inc.; Greif, Inc.; MeadWestvaco

On August 9, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors
    had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to
    repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of our
    issued and outstanding common stock (described further under the
    caption, “Repurchases of Capital Stock,” in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II,
    Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

This program has no set expiration date. This program replaced
    our prior share repurchase program, which we terminated at that
    time. We purchased all shares during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2010 pursuant to our share repurchase program.
    We report price calculations in column (b) in the table
    above including commissions.

We do, from time to time, acquire shares of common stock that
    are (a) withheld from awards under our 2005 contingent
    stock plan pursuant to the provision of that plan that permits
    tax withholding obligations or other legally required charges to
    be satisfied by having us withhold shares from an award under
    that plan, or (b) forfeited under that plan upon failure to
    satisfy vesting conditions, for which no consideration is paid.
    These acquisitions are not included in the table above.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The information in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (“MD&A”) should be read together with our
    consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in
    Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in
    Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and
    all dollars are in millions, except per share amounts.

Non-U.S.

GAAP Information

In our MD&A, we present financial information in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, but we also present financial measures that
    do not conform to U.S. GAAP, which we refer to as

non-U.S. GAAP.

As discussed below, we provide this supplemental information as
    our management believes it is useful to investors. Investors
    should use caution, however, when reviewing our

non-U.S. GAAP

presentations. The

non-U.S. GAAP

information is not a substitute for U.S. GAAP information.
    It does not purport to represent the similarly titled
    U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our
    performance under U.S. GAAP. Further,

non-U.S. GAAP

financial measures that we present may not be comparable with
    similarly titled measures used by others.

In our “2011 Outlook” below, we present anticipated
    full year 2011 diluted net earnings per common share on a
    U.S. GAAP basis, but we also note that we will exclude any
    non-operating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2011
    related to currency fluctuations in Venezuela. We believe these
    gains or losses are attributable to the significant foreign
    exchange fluctuations in that country and are not indicative of
    a normal operating environment. We will exclude future foreign
    exchange and other non-operating gains and or losses from our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share relating to our
    Venezuelan subsidiary until such time that we believe the
    foreign exchange environment in Venezuela stabilizes. We believe
    that excluding these items from our U.S. GAAP reported and
    projected net earnings performance will aid in the comparison of
    our adjusted net earnings performance between 2011 and prior
    years.

We also present adjusted diluted net earnings per common share
    in our “Highlights of Financial Performance” below,
    for the three years ended December 31, 2010. Our management
    will look at our earnings performance both on an U.S. GAAP
    basis and on a

non-U.S. GAAP

basis. Our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings performance excludes unusual items
    that are evaluated on an individual basis. Our evaluation of
    whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our

non-U.S. GAAP

net earnings performance considers both the quantitative and
    qualitative aspects of the item, including, among other things
    (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it
    relates to our ongoing business operations, and
    (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our
    normal business on a regular basis. For purposes of determining

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings performance, restructuring and
    other charges and their related tax effect are excluded.
    Further, the items excluded from

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted basis may also be excluded from the calculations of our
    performance measures set by the Compensation Committee for
    purposes of determining incentive compensation. Thus, our
    management believes that this information may be useful to
    investors.

In our “Highlights of Financial Performance,”
    “Net Sales by Segment Reporting Structure,” “Net
    Sales by Geographic Region” and elsewhere below, we first
    present our results in accordance with U.S. GAAP and also
    present a

non-U.S. GAAP

financial measure, “adjusted diluted net earnings per
    common share.” Also, in some of the discussions and tables
    that follow, we exclude the impact of foreign currency
    translation when presenting net sales information, which we
    define as “constant dollar.” Changes in net sales
    excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are

non-U.S. GAAP

financial measures. As a worldwide business, it is important
    that we take into account the effects of foreign currency
    translation when we view our results and plan our strategies.
    Nonetheless, we cannot directly control changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management looks
    at net sales to measure the performance of our business, we
    typically exclude the impact of foreign currency translation
    from net sales. We also may exclude the impact of foreign
    currency translation when making incentive compensation
    determinations. As a result, our management believes that these
    presentations may be useful to investors.



Overview

Beginning with the invention of Bubble
    Wrap

®

brand cushioning over fifty years ago, we have been a leading
    global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging
    and performance-based materials and equipment systems that serve
    an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications.

At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 2,300
    sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the
    world who sell and market our products through a large number of
    distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to
    end-users such as food processors, foodservice businesses,
    supermarket retailers and manufacturers. We have no material
    long-term contracts for the distribution of our products. In
    2010, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for
    10% or more of our consolidated net sales.

Historically, net sales in our food businesses have tended to be
    slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards
    the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to
    holiday events. Our Protective Packaging segment has also tended
    to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the

“back-to-school”

season in the mid-third quarter and through the fourth quarter
    due to the holiday shopping season.

Competition for most of our packaging products is based
    primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and
    price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging
    technology and, as a result, we maintain ongoing research and
    development programs to enable us to maintain technological
    leadership. For more details, see “Competition”
    included in “Business,” of Item 1, Part I.

Our net sales are sensitive to developments in our
    customers’ business or market conditions, changes in the
    global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation.
    Our costs can vary materially with changes in input costs,
    including petrochemical-related costs (primarily resin costs),
    which are not within our control. Consequently, our management
    focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using
    petrochemical-based raw materials as efficiently as possible. We
    also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from
    localized changes in business conditions.

We manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash
    flow. We believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to
    continue to spend on innovative research and development and to
    invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for
    property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, our ability
    to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us
    with the flexibility to modify our capital structure as the need
    or opportunity arises and return capital to our stockholders.

    Outlook

In 2011, we are anticipating an ongoing modest rate of economic
    recovery and an average constant dollar sales growth rate in the
    5% to 7% range. Presently, our full year 2011 guidance also
    assumes:

•

a

low-to-mid

single-digit percent average increase in our resin costs
    compared to our 2010 average cost;

•

a slightly unfavorable impact on net sales from foreign currency
    translation;

•

depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment
    of $145 million;

•

amortization of share-based incentive compensation expense of
    $30 million;

•

interest expense of $150 million, including
    $43 million of accrued interest on the cash portion of our
    payment under the Settlement agreement; and

•

an effective income tax rate of 27%.

As a result, we anticipate our full year 2011 diluted net
    earnings guidance to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.90.

Our guidance excludes the payment under the Settlement
    agreement, as the exact timing of the settlement payment is
    unknown, although it is possible that payment could occur in the
    first half of 2011. Payment of the Settlement agreement is
    expected to be accretive to our net earnings by approximately
    $0.12 to $0.14 per diluted share annually following the payment
    date. This impact assumes using a substantial portion of
    available cash to fund the payment and ceasing to accrue
    interest on the settlement liability. See “Settlement
    Agreement and Related



Costs,” of “Material Commitments and
    Contingencies” below, for further discussion. Additionally,
    our guidance excludes any non-operating gains or losses that may
    be recognized in 2011 due to currency fluctuations in Venezuela.

In addition, capital expenditures in 2011 are estimated to be
    $150 to $175 million.

Significant
    2010 Events

Quarterly
    Cash Dividends

In July 2010, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly
    dividend by 8% to $0.13 per common share from $0.12 per common
    share. We used cash of $80 million to pay quarterly
    dividends in 2010. During 2009, we paid quarterly cash dividends
    of $0.12 per common share using $76 million of available
    cash.

On February 17, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on
    March 18, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of
    business on March 4, 2011. The estimated amount of this
    dividend payment is $21 million based on 159 million
    shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of
    January 31, 2011.

Early
    Redemption of Debt

In December 2010, we completed an early redemption of
    $150 million of our outstanding $300 million principal
    amount of our 12% Senior Notes due 2014. We redeemed the
    notes at 127% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The
    aggregate redemption price was $196 million, which was
    funded with available cash. Because of the redemption, we
    recognized a pre-tax loss of $39 million. See “Loss on
    Debt Redemption” below for further discussion.

Completion
    of Global Manufacturing Strategy

In 2010, we recognized approximately $8 million of
    restructuring and other associated charges related to our GMS
    program, which marked the completion of this program. As a
    result of the program, we have repositioned our supply chain
    platform for more profitable growth in developing regions while
    concurrently realigning our core manufacturing sites to improve
    operating efficiency and realizing an annual $55 million
    benefit run rate.

Common
    Stock Repurchases

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we repurchased 0.4 million
    shares of our common stock using approximately $10 million
    of available cash.

As shown in the table above, our diluted net earnings per common
    share increased 7% in 2010 compared with 2009. The primary
    contributing factors to our diluted net earnings per common
    share growth in 2010 compared with 2009 were:

•

higher gross profit of $34 million, which was largely
    driven by volume growth in both our industrial and food
    businesses, benefits realized from our supply chain productivity
    improvements and from producing products in our new, low-cost
    facilities in developing regions. These factors were partially
    offset by higher average petrochemical-based raw material costs
    of approximately $130 million;

•

lower marketing, administrative and development expenses of
    $9 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation
    expenses as our financial results for 2010 did not meet some of
    our goals; and

•

a decline in the weighted average number of diluted common
    shares of 5.9 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily
    due to the early redemption in July 2009 of our
    3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033.

These factors were partially offset by an increase in
    non-operating items of $29 million, primarily due to the
    loss on debt redemption of $39 million in 2010 compared
    with $3 million in 2009.

On an adjusted basis, excluding the items detailed in
    “Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share” below, our
    diluted net earnings per common share increased 11% to $1.60 in
    2010 from $1.44 in 2009. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP
    diluted net earnings per common share to

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share is included in
    “Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share” below.

See the discussions below for further details about the material
    factors that contributed to the changes in our net earnings for
    the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Foreign
    Currency Translation Impact on Net Sales

As shown above, more than 50% of our consolidated net sales are
    generated outside the U.S. Approximately 20% of our
    consolidated net sales are euro-denominated. Since we are a
    U.S. company, we translate our foreign currency denominated
    net sales into U.S. dollars. Due to the strengthening and
    weakening in foreign currencies relative to the
    U.S. dollar, the translation of our net sales from foreign
    currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or
    unfavorable impact on our consolidated net sales.

In 2010, we experienced a favorable foreign currency translation
    impact on net sales of $70 million compared with 2009 due
    to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the
    U.S. dollar. This impact includes an unfavorable foreign
    currency translation impact of $18 million in the second
    half of 2010 as the U.S. dollar began to strengthen against
    most foreign currencies.

In 2009, we experienced an unfavorable foreign currency
    translation impact on net sales of $242 million compared
    with 2008 due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
    relative to most foreign currencies. This impact includes a
    favorable foreign currency translation impact of
    $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as most foreign
    currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar.

Components
    of Change in Net Sales

The following tables present the components of change in net
    sales by our segment reporting structure for 2010 compared with
    2009 and 2009 compared with 2008. We also present the change in
    net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation,
    a

non-U.S. GAAP

measure, which we define as “constant dollar.” We
    believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability
    between periods.

Our product price/mix reported above includes the net impact of
    our pricing actions as well as the

period-to-period

change in the mix of products sold. Also included in our
    reported product price/mix is the net effect of some of our
    customers purchasing our products in other countries at selling
    prices denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. This primarily
    arises when we export product from the U.S. and euro-zone
    countries. The impact to our reported product price/mix of these
    purchases in other countries at selling prices denominated in
    U.S. dollars or euros was approximately $(17) million
    unfavorable for 2010 compared with 2009 and approximately
    $55 million favorable for 2009 compared with 2008. In 2010
    and 2009, this effect was most pronounced in our Food Packaging
    segment, in part due to the volatility in Venezuelan exchange
    rates.

The following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis.

Food
    Packaging Segment Net Sales

    compared with 2009

The $34 million or 2% increase in net sales in 2010
    compared with 2009 was primarily due to:

•

higher unit volumes in North America of $36 million, or 4%,
    and in the Latin American region of $22 million, or 8%;

partially offset by:

•

unfavorable impacts of product price/mix in North America of
    $12 million, or 1%, and in the Latin American region of
    $9 million, or 3%.

The higher unit volumes in North America and in Latin America
    were mostly due to an increase in our customers’ beef
    production rates, resulting in higher demand for most of our
    packaging formats.

The unfavorable impact of product price/mix in North America was
    primarily due to selectively lower pricing associated with
    higher customer volume commitments, which offset the benefits of
    our price increases and formula contract adjustments in the
    year. The unfavorable impact of product price/mix in the Latin
    American region was primarily due to the volatility of the
    Venezuelan currency as discussed above.

    compared with 2008

The $9 million or 1% decrease in net sales in 2009 compared
    with 2008 was primarily due to:

•

decreases in unit volume in Europe of $24 million, or 5%,
    and in the United States of $19 million, or 2%;

partially offset by:

•

favorable impacts of product price/mix in Latin America of
    $31 million, or 11%.



The decrease in unit volume in Europe was primarily due to lower
    equipment sales, which we believe was mostly the result of lower
    capital spending by customers in this region. The decrease in
    unit volume in the United States was primarily due to the
    decline in local meat production mostly experienced during the
    first nine months of 2009. The unit volume declines in Europe
    and the United States reflected the continuing economic weakness
    in these regions. The favorable impact of product price/mix in
    Latin America was primarily due to the timing of pricing actions
    on most Food Packaging products, in part to cover the weakness
    of the Venezuelan currency.

Food
    Solutions Segment Net Sales

    compared with 2009

The $30 million, or 4%, increase in net sales in 2010
    compared with 2009 was primarily due to:

•

higher unit volumes in Europe of $11 million, or 3%, and
    North America of $10 million, or 3%, mostly due to
    increased demand for our ready meals packaging products and, to
    a lesser extent, our vertical pouch packaging products; and

•

favorable product price/mix in North America of
    $12 million, or 3%, from the benefits of both prior price
    increases and contract adjustments.

These factors were partially offset by a decline in product
    price/mix in Europe of $5 million, or 2%, primarily due to
    the timing of price adjustments for changes in resin costs
    experienced in the first half of 2010.

    compared with 2008

The $39 million, or 4%, decrease in net sales in 2009
    compared with 2008 was primarily due to decreases in unit volume
    in Europe of $29 million, or 7%, and in North America of
    $13 million, or 3%. The decrease in unit volume in Europe
    was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of reduced
    consumption of certain meats in some countries, which in turn
    resulted in lower sales of our case-ready packaging products.
    The decrease in North America was primarily due to lower sales
    of our vertical pouch packaging products to customers in the
    foodservice sector. The unit volume decreases in Europe and
    North America reflected the economic weakness in these regions.

Outsourced
    Products

In addition to net sales from products produced in our
    facilities, net trade sales in this segment were also
    attributable to the sale of products fabricated by other
    manufacturers, which we refer to as “outsourced
    products.” Outsourced products include, among others, foam
    and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated primarily in
    North America and in Europe that largely support our case ready
    products. We have strategically opted to use third-party
    manufacturers for technically less complex products and selected
    equipment in order to offer customers a broader range of
    solutions. In each of the three years ended December 31,
    2010, outsourced products represented approximately 17% of Food
    Solutions net sales.

We have benefited from this strategy with increased net sales
    and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures. Net
    sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted
    to $159 million in 2010, $150 million in 2009 and
    $170 million in 2008. In addition, we had sales of
    $119 million in 2010, $90 million in 2009 and
    $70 million in 2008 from the sales of outsourced products
    in our other segments, primarily our Protective Packaging
    segment.

Protective
    Packaging Segment Net Sales

    compared with 2009

The $96 million, or 8%, increase in net sales in 2010
    compared with 2009 was primarily the result of higher unit
    volumes in North America of $60 million, or 9%, in
    Europe of $24 million, or 7%, and in the Asia Pacific
    region of $17 million, or 13%. These increases were
    principally attributable to improving economic conditions in
    these regions, which were consistent with manufacturing output
    and export and shipping trends. Also contributing to the higher
    unit volumes, to a lesser extent, was strength in
    fulfillment/e-commerce applications.



    compared with 2008

The $238 million, or 16%, decrease in net sales in 2009
    compared with 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit volume
    in North America of $115 million, or 14%, and in
    Europe of $70 million, or 16%. These declines were
    principally attributable to continuing economic weakness in
    these regions, which were consistent with manufacturing output
    and export and shipping trends.

Other
    Net Sales

    compared to 2009

The $17 million, or 5%, increase in 2010 compared with 2009
    was primarily attributed to higher unit volumes in North America
    of $12 million, or 11%, and in Europe of $16 million,
    or 11%. These increases were primarily attributed to higher unit
    volumes for some of our Specialty Materials products, which were
    principally the result of improving economic conditions in these
    regions, consistent with manufacturing output and export and
    shipping trends. Partially offsetting these factors was lower
    unit volumes in our Medical Applications business in Asia of
    $13 million, or 38%, primarily due to the impact of an
    April 2010 licensing expiration in China. Late in the third
    quarter of 2010, our license was renewed.

    compared with 2008

The $73 million, or 18%, decrease in 2009 compared with
    2008 was primarily attributed to lower unit volumes in North
    America of $44 million, or 29%, and in Europe of
    $27 million, or 14%. These declines were primarily
    attributed to lower unit volumes for some of our Specialty
    Materials products, which were principally the result of
    continuing economic weakness in these regions consistent with
    manufacturing output and export and shipping trends.

Cost of
    Sales

Our primary input costs include resins, direct and indirect
    labor, other raw materials and other input costs, including
    energy-related costs and transportation costs. We utilize
    petrochemical-based resins in the manufacture of many of our
    products. The costs for these raw materials are impacted by the
    rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices, since they
    serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins.
    The prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile
    in recent years as a result of changes in global demand. In
    addition, supply and demand imbalances of intermediate compounds
    such as benzene and supplier facility outages also impacted
    resin costs. Although changes in the prices of crude oil and
    natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are indicative of
    the variations in raw materials and other input costs we face.
    We continue to monitor changes in raw material and
    energy-related costs as they occur and take pricing actions as
    appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they
    occur.

In this cost of sales section and in the marketing,
    administrative and development expenses section below, when we
    refer to “variable incentive compensation” we are
    referring to our annual U.S. profit sharing contribution
    (in both sections) and our annual cash incentive compensation
    (in the marketing, administrative and development expenses
    section). Variable incentive compensation does not include our
    share-based incentive compensation programs. Details about our
    share-based incentive compensation programs are included in
    Note 17, “Stockholders’ Equity.”

Cost of sales for the three years ended December 31, 2010
    was as follows:

    compared with 2009

The $213 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared
    with 2009 was primarily due to:

•

higher average petrochemical-based raw material expenditures due
    to additional consumption from the 5% increase in sales volume
    in 2010;

•

higher resin costs of approximately $130 million
    attributable to the increased average cost per pound of resin in
    2010;

•

higher other input costs, including transportation and
    energy-related costs of $30 million in 2010; and

•

the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of
    $53 million in 2010.

The factors above that drove the increase in cost of sales in
    2010 compared with 2009 were partially offset by our supply
    chain productivity improvements, including lower headcount in
    2010 compared with 2009 despite higher unit volumes, and by the
    benefits of producing products in our new, low-cost facilities
    in developing regions.

Also partially offsetting the increase in cost of sales was
    lower variable incentive compensation expenses of
    $6 million in 2010 compared with 2009 because we did not
    meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals.

Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation
    of GMS were $4 million in 2010 compared with
    $10 million in 2009.

    compared with 2008

The $583 million decrease in cost of sales in 2009 compared
    with 2008 was primarily due to:

•

lower average petrochemical-based raw material expenditures of
    approximately $200 million, which was primarily experienced
    in the first nine months of 2009;

•

the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of
    $185 million;

•

other lower input costs, including favorable freight and
    energy-related costs in 2009, of approximately
    $45 million; and

•

estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and
    other cost control measures in 2009, including approximately
    $40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost
    reduction and productivity program and from GMS.

Expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation
    of GMS were $10 million in 2009 compared with
    $7 million in 2008.

Marketing,
    Administrative and Development Expenses

Marketing, administrative and development expenses for the three
    years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows:

Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased
    $9 million in 2010 compared with 2009. These expenses
    decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses
    of approximately $30 million in 2010, primarily because we
    did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals. See
    the table below for further details.



This factor was partially offset by:

•

higher sales and marketing costs to support the increase in net
    sales in 2010 compared with 2009, including higher travel and
    entertainment expenses of $20 million; and

•

additional research and development expenses of $5 million,
    which includes spending related to innovation and new product
    introductions.

Our variable incentive compensation expense includes annual cash
    incentives and our annual U.S. profit sharing contribution.
    We also have long-term, share-based incentive compensation that
    is included in marketing, administrative and development
    expenses. The table below shows the year over year changes in
    these expenses in 2010 compared with 2009.

Approximately $10 million in 2010 and $16 million in
    2009 of our U.S. profit sharing contribution expense is included
    in cost of sales.

    compared with 2008

Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased
    $36 million in 2009 compared with 2008. These expenses
    decreased due to the following:

•

estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and
    other cost control measures in 2009, including approximately
    $40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost
    reduction and productivity program, lower travel and
    entertainment expenses and GMS; and

•

the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of
    $31 million.

These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive
    compensation expenses, including long-term share-based incentive
    compensation of approximately $39 million in 2009, of which
    approximately $30 million occurred in the fourth quarter of
    2009, because we exceeded our 2009 financial performance goals
    but did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals.

Restructuring
    Activities

Global
    Manufacturing Strategy

We announced our global manufacturing strategy program in 2006
    and completed the program in 2010. The goals of this multi-year
    program were to realign our manufacturing footprint to expand
    capacity in growing markets, to further improve our operating
    efficiencies, and to implement new technologies more
    effectively. Additionally, we optimized certain manufacturing
    platforms in North America and Europe into centers of
    excellence. By taking advantage of new technologies and
    streamlining production on a global scale, we have continued to
    enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position
    and have produced meaningful benefits.

At the inception of this multi-year program, we projected
    cumulative capital expenditures and related costs to implement
    this program to be approximately $220 million. The actual
    amount was $235 million. A substantial portion of the
    difference between the projected amount and the actual amount of
    capital expenditures and related costs was due to foreign
    currency translation.

The capital expenditures, associated costs and related
    restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since
    inception of this multi-year program are included in the table
    below. These associated costs and restructuring and other
    charges have been excluded from our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See
    “Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share” below for

We estimate that we realized approximately $25 million in
    benefits in 2008, which increased to $45 million in 2009,
    and increased further to $55 million in 2010. These
    benefits are primarily realized in cost of sales.

European
    Facility Closure

In December 2010, we informed affected employees that we would
    be closing a small shrink packaging factory in Europe. We are
    taking this action based on our review of operating costs and
    technology levels in an effort to simplify our plant network and
    improve our operating efficiency. We recorded associated costs
    and restructuring and other charges of $7 million in 2010.
    We will record the remaining costs of approximately $1 to
    2 million in future years, mostly in 2011.

These associated costs and restructuring and other charges
    related to this action have been excluded from our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See
    “Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share” below for
    further details.

See Note 4, “Restructuring Activities,” for
    additional information on GMS and our other recent restructuring
    activities.

    primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit
    volumes mentioned above. Also contributing to this
    segment’s increase in operating profit were lower
    marketing, administrative and development expenses as a
    percentage of net sales, which include the impact of lower
    variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above. These
    factors were partially offset by higher average
    petrochemical-based raw material expenditures of approximately
    $51 million.

Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of GMS
    were $3 million in 2010 compared with $8 million in
    2009.

    compared with 2008

The increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was
    primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average
    petrochemical-based raw material expenditures of approximately
    $80 million and the favorable impact of product price/mix
    of $46 million and freight and utilities costs of
    approximately $16 million. Operating profit was also
    favorably impacted by benefits from GMS and our expense control
    initiatives and other cost control



measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above. These items were
    partially offset by the decline in unit volumes discussed above.

Expenses in this segment related to the implementation of GMS
    were $8 million in 2009 compared with $4 million in
    2008.

Food
    Solutions Segment Operating Profit

    compared with 2009

The increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was
    primarily due to the favorable impacts of the increase in unit
    volumes and product price/mix, both mentioned above. Also
    contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit
    were lower marketing, administrative and development expenses as
    a percentage of net sales, which include the impact of lower
    variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above. These
    factors were partially offset by higher average
    petrochemical-based raw material expenditures of approximately
    $30 million.

    compared with 2008

The increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was
    primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average
    petrochemical-based raw material expenditures of approximately
    $40 million and lower freight and utilities costs of
    approximately $7 million. Operating profit was also
    favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control
    initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as
    discussed above. These items were partially offset by the
    decline in unit volume discussed above.

Protective
    Packaging Segment Operating Profit

    compared with 2009

The increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was
    primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit
    volumes mentioned above. Also contributing to this
    segment’s increase in operating profit were lower
    marketing, administrative and development expenses as a
    percentage of net sales, which include the impact of lower
    variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above. These
    factors were partially offset by higher average
    petrochemical-based raw material expenditures of approximately
    $35 million. Expenses included in this segment’s
    operating profit related to the closure of a small factory in
    Europe were $3 million in 2010.

    compared with 2008

The decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was
    primarily due to the decline in unit volumes and unfavorable
    product price/mix, both discussed above. These items were
    partially offset by favorable average petrochemical-based raw
    material expenditures of approximately $60 million and
    lower freight and utilities costs of approximately
    $30 million. Operating profit was also favorably impacted
    by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost
    control measures in 2009 and 2008, as discussed above.

Other
    Operating Profit

    compared with 2009

The decrease in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was
    primarily due to higher average petrochemical-based raw material
    expenditures of approximately $14 million. Also
    contributing to the decline in operating profit were incremental
    expenses related to our new ventures. These factors were
    partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in unit
    volumes mentioned above.

    compared with 2008

The decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was
    primarily due to the decline in unit volumes in our Specialty
    Materials products discussed above. Partially offsetting this
    decline were favorable average petrochemical-based raw material
    expenditures of approximately $20 million, favorable
    product price/mix of approximately $9 million, and
    favorable freight and utilities costs of approximately
    $7 million.



Interest
    Expense

Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our
    outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized
    interest, the effects of interest rate swaps and the
    amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond
    discounts, and terminated treasury locks.

Interest expense for the three years ended December 31,

Gains on
    Sale

(Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment) of

Available-for-Sale

Securities

In 2010, we sold our five auction rate security investments,
    representing our total holdings of these securities. These sales
    resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7 million ($4 million,
    net of taxes). Before we sold these investments, we recognized
    $1 million of pre-tax

other-than-temporary

impairment in 2010 due to the decline in estimated fair value of
    some of these investments.

Our valuation of our auction rate security investments resulted
    in the recognition of

other-than-temporary

impairment of $4 million ($2 million, net of taxes) in
    2009 and $34 million ($22 million, net of taxes) in
    2008.

The gains and losses associated with our auction rate security
    investments have been excluded from our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See
    “Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share” below for
    further details.

See Note 5,

“Available-for-Sale

Investments,” for further discussion.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange (Losses) Gains Related to Venezuelan
    Subsidiary

Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated a
    highly inflationary economy. The foreign currency exchange gains
    and losses we recorded in 2010 for our Venezuelan subsidiary
    were the result of two factors: 1) the significant changes
    in the exchange rates used to settle bolivar-denominated
    transactions and 2) the significant changes in the exchange
    rates used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiary’s
    financial statements at the balance sheet date. We believe these
    gains and losses are attributable to an unpredictable foreign
    currency environment in



Venezuela. As a result, we have excluded these gains and losses
    and we will exclude future non-operating gains

and/or

losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiary from our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share until such time
    that we believe the foreign exchange environment in Venezuela
    stabilizes. See “Venezuela” in “Foreign Exchange
    Rates” of Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk,” for further discussion on
    Venezuela.

Loss on
    Debt Redemption

In December 2010, we completed an early redemption of
    $150 million of the outstanding $300 million principal
    amount of our 12% Senior Notes due February 14, 2014.
    We redeemed the notes at 127% of the principal amount plus
    accrued interest. The aggregate redemption price was
    $196 million, including $5 million of accrued
    interest. We funded the redemption with available cash. We
    recorded a pre-tax loss of $41 million resulting from the
    27% premium. We also recognized a gain of $2 million from
    the termination of a related interest rate swap. As a result,
    the total net pre-tax loss was $39 million, which equated
    to a $0.14 per common share decrease to our reported diluted net
    earnings per common share. The annual pre-tax interest expense
    savings from this redemption is $18 million, which equates
    to $0.06 per diluted common share, beginning in December 2010
    through February 2014.

In 2009, we redeemed the entire $431.3 million of our
    3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033 and recorded a
    $3 million pre-tax loss. This loss represented a 0.429%
    call premium of $2 million and a write-down of the
    remaining debt issuance costs of $1 million related to the
    issuance of these senior notes in July 2003.

The losses associated with our debt redemptions have been
    excluded from our

non-U.S. GAAP

adjusted diluted net earnings per common share. See
    “Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share” below for
    further details.

Other
    Expense, Net

See Note 19, “Other Expense, net,” for the
    components and discussion of other expense, net.

Income
    Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 25.5% for 2010, 25.9% for 2009
    and 19.1% for 2008. As described below, in each of those years,
    we recognized benefits for items that may not recur to the same
    extent in future years. As such, we expect an effective income
    tax rate of approximately 27% for 2011. Our 2011 effective tax
    rate may be higher if we fund the Settlement agreement in 2011.
    We anticipate that funding the Settlement agreement in 2011 will
    result in a loss for U.S. income tax return purposes. This
    loss will eliminate some tax benefits in 2011, primarily the
    domestic manufacturing deduction.

For 2010, our effective income tax rate was lower than the
    statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due
    to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings,
    as well as income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic
    manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state income taxes.

Our 2009 effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory
    U.S. federal income tax rate for the same reasons as in
    2010, except that the benefits were offset by an increase in
    accruals relating to uncertain tax positions.

See Note 15, “Income Taxes,” for a reconciliation
    of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax
    rate, which also shows the major components of the year over
    year changes.

•

a description of our principal sources of liquidity;

•

a description of our outstanding indebtedness;

•

    capital;

•

    equity; and

•

a description of our derivative financial instruments.

Material
    Commitments and Contingencies

Settlement
    Agreement and Related Costs

We recorded a pre-tax charge of $850.1 million in 2002, of
    which $512.5 million represents a cash payment that we are
    required to make (subject to the satisfaction of the terms and
    conditions of the Settlement agreement) upon the effectiveness
    of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W.R.
    Grace & Co. We did not use cash in any period with
    respect to this liability.

We currently expect to fund a substantial portion of this
    payment when it becomes due by using accumulated cash and cash
    equivalents with the remainder from our committed credit
    facilities. Our global credit facility and European credit
    facility are available for general corporate purposes, including
    the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the
    Settlement agreement. See “Principal Sources of
    Liquidity” below. The cash payment of



$512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate,
    which is compounded annually, from December 21, 2002 to the
    date of payment. This accrued interest was $275 million at
    December 31, 2010 and is recorded in Settlement agreement
    and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet.
    The total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was
    $788 million at December 31, 2010. In addition, the
    Settlement agreement provides for the issuance of
    18 million shares of our common stock. Since the impact of
    issuing these shares is dilutive, under U.S. GAAP, they
    have been included in our calculation of diluted net earnings
    per common share for all periods presented.

Tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the
    Settlement agreement, which are currently recorded as deferred
    tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are anticipated
    to provide approximately $370 million of current and future
    cash tax benefits. These deferred tax assets reflect the cash
    portion of the Settlement agreement and related accrued interest
    and the fair market value of the 18 million shares of our
    common stock at a post-split price of $17.86 per share, which
    was the price when the Settlement agreement was reached in 2002.
    The amount and timing of future cash tax benefits could vary,
    depending on the amount of cash paid by us and various facts and
    circumstances at the time of payment under the Settlement
    agreement, including the price of our common stock, our tax
    position and the applicable tax codes. Any changes in the tax
    benefits resulting from an increase in our stock price in excess
    of the $17.86 share price mentioned above will not have an
    impact on our net earnings.

Additionally we may incur an approximate one percentage point
    increase in our effective income tax rate during the calendar
    year in which we make the payment under the Settlement. We
    anticipate that funding the Settlement agreement will result in
    a loss for U.S. income tax purposes, and this loss will
    eliminate some tax benefits for that year, primarily the
    domestic manufacturing deduction.

While the Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the PI Settlement Plan,
    additional proceedings may be held before the District Court or
    other courts to consider matters related to the PI Settlement
    Plan. Additionally, various parties have filed notices of appeal
    or have otherwise challenged the Memorandum Opinion and
    Confirmation Order, and the PI Settlement Plan may be subject to
    further appeal or challenge by additional parties. Parties filed
    a number of objections to the PI Settlement Plan, and some of
    these objections concerned injunctions, releases and provisions
    as applied to us

and/or

that
    are contemplated by the Settlement agreement. Such parties (or
    others) may appeal or otherwise challenge the Bankruptcy
    Court’s Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation Order, or
    otherwise continue to oppose the PI Settlement Plan. We do not
    know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become
    effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the
    terms of the Settlement agreement.

As mentioned in “2011 Outlook” above, our full year
    2011 diluted net earnings per common share guidance continues to
    exclude the payment under the Settlement agreement, as the
    timing is unknown. Payment under the Settlement agreement is
    expected to be accretive to our post-payment diluted net
    earnings per common share by approximately $0.12 to $0.14
    annually. This range primarily represents the accretive impact
    on our net earnings from ceasing to accrue any future interest
    on the settlement amount following the payment.

— The debt shown in the above table excludes
    unamortized bond discounts as of December 31, 2010 and
    therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required
    to be repaid in each period.

Operating Leases

— The contractual operating
    lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated
    future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under
    non-cancelable real and personal property leases as of
    December 31, 2010.

Cash Portion of the Settlement Agreement

— The
    Settlement agreement is described more fully in “Settlement
    Agreement and Related Costs,” of Note 16,
    “Commitments and Contingencies.”

Other Principal Contractual Obligations

— Other
    principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase
    an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or
    services, including energy, in the normal course of business.
    These obligations are enforceable and legally binding and
    specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum
    quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions
    and the approximate timing of the purchase.

Liability
    for Unrecognized Tax Benefits

At December 31, 2010, we had liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits and related interest of $11 million, which is
    included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
    At December 31, 2010, we cannot reasonably estimate the
    future period or periods of cash settlement of these
    liabilities. See Note 15, “Income Taxes,” for
    further discussion.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have reviewed our off-balance sheet arrangements and have
    determined that none of those arrangements has a material
    current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future
    effect on our consolidated financial statements, liquidity,
    capital expenditures or capital resources.

Income
    Tax Payments

We currently expect to pay between $100 million and
    $115 million in income taxes in 2011, assuming we do not
    make the Settlement agreement payment in 2011. If we were to
    make the Settlement agreement payment in 2011, we would cease
    making quarterly estimated U.S. federal tax payments, thus
    significantly reducing our cash payments.

Contributions
    to Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number
    of our U.S. employees and for some of our

non-U.S. employees.

We currently expect employer contributions to be approximately
    $15 million in 2011.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from
    environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for
    anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation
    efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into
    account any discounting for the time value of money and are not
    reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not
    believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in
    excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental
    matters will be material to our consolidated statements of
    operations, balance sheets or cash flows. We reassess
    environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better
    defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their
    costs. We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on
    available information, including the progress of remedial
    investigations at each site, the current status of discussions
    with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of
    remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially
    responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the
    outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are
    assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the
    recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures
    are not material to our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations. We believe that we have adequately
    reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

Principal
    Sources of Liquidity

We require cash to fund our operating expenses, capital
    expenditures, interest, taxes and dividend payments and to pay
    our debt obligations and other long-term liabilities as they
    come due. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from
    operations, accumulated cash and amounts available under our
    existing lines of credit described below, including the global
    credit facility and the European credit facility, and our
    accounts receivable securitization program.

We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash
    flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations,
    including all of the items mentioned above, and the cash payment
    under the Settlement agreement should it become payable within
    the next 12 months.

Lines
    of Credit

At December 31, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding
    under our global and European credit facilities, and we had
    $669 million available to us under these facilities. We did
    not borrow funds from these facilities during any period in 2010.

Further information about our lines of credit, our outstanding
    long-term debt and the related financial covenants and
    limitations is provided in Note 11, “Debt and Credit
    Facilities.”

Accounts
    Receivable Securitization Program

At December 31, 2010, we had $91 million available to
    us under the program, and we did not utilize this program in
    2010.

See Note 6, “Accounts Receivable Securitization
    Program,” for information concerning this program.

Covenants

At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with our
    financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in
    “Covenants” of Note 11, “Debt and Credit
    Facilities.”

Debt
    Ratings

Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may
    be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating
    agencies review periodically. The Company and our long-term
    senior unsecured debt are currently rated BB+ (positive outlook)
    by Standard & Poor’s. On November 18, 2010,
    Standard & Poor’s revised our ratings outlook to
    positive from stable. This rating is considered non-investment
    grade. The Company and our long-term senior unsecured debt are
    currently rated Baa3 by Moody’s. This rating is considered
    investment grade. On May 4, 2010, Moody’s revised our
    ratings outlook to stable from negative. If our credit ratings
    are downgraded, there could be a negative impact on our ability
    to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A
    credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any
    time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated
    independently of any other rating.

Outstanding
    Indebtedness

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our total debt outstanding
    consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table. See

Net
    Cash Provided by Operating Activities


Net cash provided by operating activities of $483 million
    for 2010 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for
    non-cash items of $480 million, which included depreciation
    and amortization of $155 million, share-based compensation
    of $31 million and the loss on debt redemption of
    $39 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities
    resulted in a net cash source of $3 million.


Net cash provided by operating activities of $552 million
    for 2009 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for
    non-cash items of $440 million, which included depreciation
    and amortization of $155 million and share-based
    compensation of $39 million. Changes in operating assets
    and liabilities provided a net cash source of $112 million
    primarily due to:

•

a decline in receivables, net, of $115 million, primarily
    attributable to the impact of lower net sales in 2009 and, to a
    lesser extent, improved collections in 2009; and

•

a decline in inventories of $110 million primarily due to
    maintaining lower inventory levels due to the decline in sales
    volumes and the decline in average petrochemical-based raw
    material costs experienced in 2009;

partially offset by:

•

use of available cash of $80 million to fund the repurchase
    of receivable interests in 2009; and

•

cash used for accounts payable of $68 million primarily due
    to the timing of payments.

Net
    Cash Used in Investing Activities


In 2010, we used net cash of $97 million for investing
    activities, which was primarily due to capital expenditures of
    $88 million and the use of $24 million of cash for the
    completion of three business acquisitions and one equity
    investment in 2010. These investments were not material,
    individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations. Partially offsetting these
    uses of cash in 2010 were cash proceeds of $13 million
    received from the sale of all of our auction rate security
    investments in 2010.


In 2009, we used net cash of $70 million for investing
    activities, which was primarily due to capital expenditures of
    $80 million. During 2009, we completed the construction
    phase of GMS with the launch of our manufacturing facility in
    Poland.

We expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate
    to expand our business, to maintain or replace depreciating
    property, plant and equipment, to acquire new manufacturing
    technology and to improve productivity and sales growth. We
    expect total capital expenditures in 2011 to be in the range of
    $150 million to $175 million. This projection is based
    upon our capital expenditure budget for 2011, the status of
    approved but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated
    future projects and historic spending trends. This projection
    also supports targeted cost-reduction initiatives globally. We
    expect to maintain this range of capital expenditures over the
    next several years to support our projected increases in unit
    volume growth using new technology platforms or otherwise
    requiring incremental capital.



Net
    Cash (Used in) Provided By Financing Activities


In 2010, we used $373 million of cash and cash equivalents
    for financing activities primarily due to the following
    activities:

•

the use of $196 million of cash for the redemption of
    $150 million of the outstanding $300 million principal
    amount of our 12% Senior Notes due February 14, 2014;

•

the repayment of amounts outstanding under our European credit
    facility of $64 million in the first quarter of 2010;

•

the payment of quarterly dividends of $80 million; and

•

the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of our common stock
    for $10 million.


In 2009, our financing activities provided a net
    $90 million of cash and cash equivalents, primarily due to
    the following activities:

•

issuance of $400 million of 7.875% Senior Notes due
    June 2017;

•

issuance of $300 million of 12% Senior Notes due
    February 2014; and

•

funds drawn of $64 million under our European credit
    facility;

partially offset by:

•

redemption of the entire $431.3 million of our
    3% Convertible Senior Notes;

•

retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of
    $137 million of our 6.95% Senior Notes; and

•

the payment of quarterly dividends of $76 million.

Repurchases
    of Capital Stock

During 2010, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our
    common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market
    purchases at a cost of $10 million. The average price per
    share of these common stock repurchases was $22.91. During 2009,
    we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. During 2008,
    we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock in open
    market purchases at a cost of $95 million. The average
    price per share of these common stock repurchases in 2008 was
    $23.64.

We made the share repurchases in 2010 and 2008 under the share
    repurchase program adopted by our Board of Directors in August
    2007 under which the Board of Directors authorized us to
    repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its
    issued and outstanding common stock. The program has no set
    expiration date, and we may from time to time continue to
    repurchase our common stock. See Item 5, “Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities,” for further information on
    the share repurchase program.

The 7% decrease in working capital in the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to
    the following factors:

•

Net cash used in financing activities of $373 million,
    primarily due to:

•

the repayment of long-term debt of $276 million;

•

cash used for the payment of our quarterly dividends of
    $80 million; and

•

cash used for the repurchase of common stock of $10 million;

•

net cash flows used in investing activities of $97 million,
    primarily for capital expenditures; and

•

a decrease in current deferred tax assets of $30 million,
    primarily due to the reclassification of certain tax benefits
    from current to long-term assets;

partially offset by:

•

net cash flows from operations of $483 million.

Changes
    in Stockholders’ Equity

The $201 million, or 9%, increase in stockholders’
    equity in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the
    following:

•

an increase in retained earnings of $175 million,
    reflecting the net impact in 2010 from net earnings of
    $256 million, less dividends paid and accrued on our common
    stock of $81 million; and

•

an increase in additional paid-in capital of $26 million,
    primarily due to the recognition of our share-based incentive
    compensation expenses.

Recently
    Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting
    Guidance and Disclosure Requirements

We are subject to numerous recently issued statements of
    financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and
    disclosure requirements. Note 2, “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting
    Standards,” which is contained in Part II, Item 8
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations are based upon our
    consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
    management to make estimates and



assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities.

Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis
    and are based on all available evidence, including historical
    experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions,
    management draws from those available sources that can best
    contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers
    and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel,
    experts and actuaries. In addition, we use internally generated
    reports and statistics, such as aging of accounts receivable, as
    well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry
    reports and third-party research studies. The results of these
    estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying
    value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates
    under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed,
    and any such differences may be material to our consolidated
    financial statements.

We believe the following accounting policies are critical to
    understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect
    the more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The
    critical accounting policies discussed below should be read
    together with our significant accounting policies set forth in
    Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.”

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our
    customers if they satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. We
    maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses
    resulting from the failure of our customers to make required
    payments. An additional allowance may be required if the
    financial condition of our customers deteriorates. The allowance
    for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management
    assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the
    accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is reviewed quarterly, and changes to the allowance are
    made through the provision for bad debts, which is included in
    marketing, administrative and development expenses on our
    consolidated statements of operations. These changes may reflect
    changes in economic, business and market conditions. The
    allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and
    decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries.

The provision for bad debts charged against operating results is
    based on several factors including, but not limited to, a
    regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer
    balances, the length of time a receivable is past due and our
    historical experience with our customers. In circumstances where
    a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
    obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad
    debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the
    amount we reasonably assess will be collected. If circumstances
    change, such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected
    material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to
    pay, our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a
    material amount.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize
    valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
    and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
    possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment
    of fair value. We determine fair value of our financial
    instruments based on assumptions that market participants would
    use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most
    advantageous market. When considering market participant
    assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value
    hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable
    inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

•

Level 1 Inputs:

Unadjusted quoted prices
    in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible
    to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

•

Level 2 Inputs:

Other than quoted prices
    included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the
    asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the asset or liability.



•

Level 3 Inputs:

Unobservable inputs for
    the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent
    that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for
    situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for
    the asset or liability at measurement date.

Our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are
    subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
    judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our
    estimates. See Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Other Financial Instruments,” for further details on our
    fair value measurements.

Commitments
    and Contingencies — Litigation

On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and
    costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We
    accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when
    the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation
    proceedings are evaluated on a

case-by-case

basis considering the available information, including that
    received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess
    potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to
    determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we
    use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we
    will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
    adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable
    estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In
    assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if
    any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs
    expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency,
    as incurred. We have in the past adjusted existing accruals as
    proceedings have continued, been settled or otherwise provided
    further information on which we could review the likelihood of
    outflows of resources and their measurability, and we expect to
    do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties
    related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential
    insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be
    resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or
    disclosures that we have previously made.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The determination of the value of long-lived assets requires
    management to make assumptions and estimates that affect our
    consolidated financial statements. We periodically review
    long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever
    there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may
    not be recoverable.

Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of
    impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on
    operational performance, market conditions and other factors,
    and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of
    long-lived assets and result in possible impairment expense in
    our consolidated financial statements. As assumptions and
    estimates change in the future, we may be required to record an
    impairment charge.

Goodwill

Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually
    on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each
    year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after
    conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no
    longer be recoverable.

A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses
    one level below that operating segment — the
    “component” level — discrete financial
    information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management,
    and the component has economic characteristics that are
    different from the economic characteristics of the other
    components of the operating segment, in which case the component
    is the reporting unit.

We use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We
    must recognize a non-cash impairment charge for the amount, if
    any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
    implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for
    each of our reporting units using a combination of an income
    approach and appropriate market approaches, each based on an
    applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based
    on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and
    reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from
    a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe
    that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of
    a reporting unit’s fair value.



Fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a
    number of factors, including projected future operating results,
    anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates,
    comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry
    grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent
    uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our
    judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we
    believe that the combination of these methods provides a
    reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting
    units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for
    each reporting unit were consistent among these methods.

Income
    Approach Used to Determine Fair Values

The income approach is based upon the present value of expected
    cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value
    using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future
    cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an
    unleveraged debt-free basis. We use a discount rate that
    reflects a market-derived weighted average cost of capital. We
    believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a
    fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s
    expected long-term operating and cash flow performance. The
    projections are based upon our best estimates of projected
    economic and market conditions over the related period including
    growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating
    margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and
    assumptions include terminal value long-term growth rates,
    provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and
    changes in future cashless, debt-free working capital.

Market
    Approaches Used to Determine Fair Values

Each year we consider various market approaches that could be
    used to determine fair value. Historically, we have considered
    two relevant market approaches. In 2010, an additional relevant
    market approach was included to determine fair value, and this
    approach is referred to as the merger and acquisition method.

The first market approach estimates the fair value of the
    reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance
    measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance.
    These multiples are derived from comparable publicly-traded
    companies with similar investment characteristics to the
    reporting unit, and such comparables are reviewed and updated as
    needed annually. We believe that this approach is appropriate
    because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from
    entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable
    to our reporting units and the Company. The second market
    approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the
    Company, and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is
    based on the applicable multiples of the Company. The third
    market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of
    comparable publicly-traded and privately-held companies in the
    packaging industry.

The key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine
    fair value under these market approaches include trailing and
    future

12-month

operating performance results and the selection of the relevant
    multiples to be applied. Under the first and second market
    approaches, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is
    usually willing to pay over the current market price of a
    publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity
    values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100%
    ownership interest, where applicable.

See Note 9, “Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets,” for details of our goodwill balance and the
    goodwill review performed in 2010 and other related information.

Pensions

We maintain a qualified non-contributory profit sharing plan and
    qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most
    U.S. employees are eligible to participate. For a limited
    number of our U.S. employees and for some of our
    international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension
    plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to
    make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit
    obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined
    benefit pension plans.

The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit
    cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and
    estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a

plan-by-plan

basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the
    discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation,
    the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the
    expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these



assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends
    and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of
    providing retirement benefits.

In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions
    and other data sources management considers reasonable based
    upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible
    employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average
    expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data,
    historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe
    these considerations provide the basis for reasonable
    assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on our
    long-term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to
    determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is
    December 31.

At December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation for
    our U.S. pension plans was $55 million, and the net
    periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2010
    was $3 million. At December 31, 2010, the projected
    benefit obligation for our international pension plans was
    $286 million, and the net periodic benefit cost for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 was $16 million.

In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could
    have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized
    on our consolidated financial statements. A 25 basis point
    change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point
    change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) in
    the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 and
    the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 (in millions).

Income
    Taxes

Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax
    liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of
    our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets arise from net
    deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards.
    We evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when
    the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets
    become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be
    utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future
    income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the
    expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected
    taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, we
    provide a valuation allowance.



In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate
    future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility
    of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax
    benefit carry forwards and past operating results, to determine
    which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be
    realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates
    and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation
    allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that
    actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, we
    may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes, we also
    evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of
    limitations have not expired. Based on this review, we may
    establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could
    be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. We
    adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and
    circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes
    in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest
    ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the
    reserve, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax
    benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the
    reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves
    proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge
    to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to
    reserves and related expenses could materially affect our
    consolidated financial statements.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
    if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the consolidated financial statements from such positions are
    measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
    fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with
    tax authorities. See Note 15, “Income Taxes,” for
    further discussion.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in
    the global financial markets, interest rates, foreign currency
    exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of
    our customers and suppliers, which may adversely affect our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations. We
    seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and
    financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the
    use of derivative financial instruments. We do not purchase,
    hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading
    purposes.

Interest
    Rates

From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps, collars or
    options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding interest rate
    swaps, but no outstanding collars or options.



The information set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

in Note 12, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,”
    under the caption “Interest Rate Swaps” is
    incorporated herein by reference.

See Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and Other
    Financial Instruments,” for details of the methodology and
    inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt.
    The fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in
    interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt
    will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
    rates rise. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would
    result in an increase of $57 million in the fair value of
    the total debt balance at December 31, 2010. These changes
    in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our
    obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any
    related interest of such debt.

Foreign
    Exchange Rates

Operations

As a large global organization, we face exposure to changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over
    time as business practices evolve and could materially impact
    our consolidated financial position or results of operations in
    the future. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations,” above for the impacts foreign currency
    translation had on our operations.

Venezuela

Economic events in Venezuela have exposed us to heightened
    levels of foreign currency exchange risk.

Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated a
    highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP, and the
    U.S. dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional
    currency for our subsidiary in Venezuela. Accordingly, all
    bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were
    re-measured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange
    rate available to us, and any changes in the exchange rate were
    reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related
    to our Venezuelan subsidiary on the consolidated statement of
    operations. Also, in January 2010, the Venezuelan government
    devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate
    from 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar to 4.3 bolivars per
    U.S. dollar for non-essential transactions and 2.60
    bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential transactions.

On January 1, 2010 we did not have access or permission to
    use the official exchange rate. Accordingly, for the majority of
    our transactions, we accessed the parallel foreign currency
    exchange market (which was a rate of 5.95 bolivars per
    U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009) that was
    available to entities that did not have access to the official
    exchange rate. Since we did not have access to the official
    exchange rate, we translated our Venezuelan subsidiary’s
    balance sheet using the parallel rate at December 31, 2009.

In May 2010, the Venezuelan government closed the parallel
    foreign currency exchange market and in June 2010 replaced it
    with a new foreign currency exchange system, the Transaction
    System in Securities in Foreign Currency (“SITME”).
    The Central Bank of Venezuela began accepting and approving
    applications, under certain conditions, for non government
    operated Foreign Exchange Administrative Board
    (“CADIVI”) exchange transactions at the
    weighted-average implicit exchange rate obtained from the SITME.
    Effective June 9, 2010, the SITME weighted average implicit
    exchange rate was 5.3 bolivars per U.S dollar. We did not access
    the SITME during 2010.

From time to time during 2010 our access to the official
    exchange rate was restricted. However, as of December 31,
    2010, we had access to the CADIVI in Venezuela. Therefore, as of
    December 31, 2010, we re-measured the net
    bolivar-denominated monetary assets of approximately
    $16 million (consisting primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents) of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official
    exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. At
    December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary had a negative
    cumulative translation adjustment balance of approximately
    $46 million. During 2010, we settled transactions at the
    applicable official exchange rates.

As a result of the changes in the exchange rates upon settlement
    of bolivar-denominated transactions and upon the remeasurement
    of our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements, we
    recognized net gains of $6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.



For the year ended December 31, 2010, less than 1% of our
    consolidated net sales were derived from our business in
    Venezuela and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating
    profit was derived from our business in Venezuela.

Effective January 1, 2011, the Venezuelan government
    devalued the bolivar by eliminating the non-essential exchange
    rate of 2.60 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Therefore, there are
    now only two legal exchange rates available. This includes the
    CADIVI non-essential rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar
    and the SITME rate of 5.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar.

The potential future impact to our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations for future
    bolivar-denominated transactions will depend on our access to
    U.S. dollars and on the exchange rates in effect when we
    enter into, remeasure and settle transactions. Therefore, it is
    difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction
    settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into
    U.S. dollars.

Foreign
    Currency Forward Contracts

We use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts
    payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in
    foreign currencies. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign
    exchange rates at December 31, 2010 would have caused us to
    pay approximately $24 million to terminate these contracts.

Our foreign currency forward contracts are described in
    Note 12, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,”
    which is contained in Part II, Item 8, and in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Derivative Financial
    Instruments — Foreign Currency Forward
    Contracts,” contained in Part II, Item 7 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

which information is incorporated herein by reference.

We may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such
    as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in
    foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps
    related to certain financing transactions. These instruments can
    potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust
    interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one
    currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At
    December 31, 2010, we had no foreign exchange options or
    interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding.

Outstanding
    Debt

Our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional
    currency of the borrower. We believe that this enables us to
    better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements
    and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities. The
    amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency
    other than the U.S. dollar was $26 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $109 million at
    December 31, 2009.

Customer
    Credit

We are exposed to credit risk from our customers. In the normal
    course of business we extend credit to our customers if they
    satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. We maintain an allowance
    for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
    failure of our customers to make required payments. An
    additional allowance may be required if the financial condition
    of our customers deteriorates. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be
    appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts
    receivable portfolio.

Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to
    bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other
    reasons. Our provision for bad debt expense was $7 million
    in 2010, $6 million in 2009 and $9 million in 2008.
    The allowance for doubtful accounts was $17 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $18 million at December 31,
    2009.

Pensions

Recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high
    degree of volatility and increased risks and short-term
    liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held
    by our defined benefit pension plans, which have impacted the
    performance of some of the plan assets. Based upon the annual
    valuation of our defined benefit



pension plans at December 31, 2010, we expect our net
    periodic benefit costs to be approximately $14 million in
    2011. See Note 14, “Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings
    Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” for further
    details on our defined benefit pension plans.

Commodities

We use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins
    and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in
    conjunction with our manufacturing processes. Generally, we
    acquire these components at market prices in the region in which
    they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge
    commodity prices. Moreover, we seek to maintain appropriate
    levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the
    expense and risks of carrying excess inventories. We do not
    typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of
    production requirements. As a result, we are exposed to market
    risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Sealed Air Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and
    comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2010. In connection with our
    audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have
    audited financial statement schedule II —
    valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves. We also have
    audited Sealed Air Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Sealed Air
    Corporation’s management is responsible for these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements
    included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our
    opinion, Sealed Air Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

Organization
    and Nature of Operations

We are a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide
    range of packaging and performance-based materials and equipment
    systems that serve an array of food, industrial, medical and
    consumer applications.

We conduct substantially all of our business through two direct
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air
    Corporation (US). These two subsidiaries, directly and
    indirectly, own substantially all of the assets of the business
    and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries
    around the world. We adopted this corporate structure in
    connection with the Cryovac transaction. See “Cryovac
    Transaction Commitments and Contingencies,” of
    Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for a
    description of the Cryovac transaction and related terms used in
    these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
    Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements include all of the
    accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries. We have eliminated
    all significant intercompany transactions and balances in
    consolidation. All amounts are in millions, except per share
    amounts, and approximate due to rounding. Some prior period
    amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
    presentation. These reclassifications, individually and in the
    aggregate, had no impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and
    related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
    our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported.
    These estimates include, among other items, assessing the
    collectibility of receivables, the use and recoverability of
    inventory, the estimation of fair value of financial
    instruments, assumptions used in the calculation of income
    taxes, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and
    intangible assets, assumptions used in our defined benefit
    pension plans, estimates related to self-insurance such as the
    aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical
    experience, insurance and actuarial estimates and estimated
    trends in claim values, costs for incentive compensation and
    accruals for commitments and contingencies. We review these
    estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects
    of revisions in the consolidated financial statements in the
    period we determine any revisions to be necessary. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Financial
    Instruments

We may use financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps,
    interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock
    agreements and foreign currency exchange forward contracts and
    options relating to our borrowing and trade activities. We may
    use these financial instruments from time to time to manage our
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency
    exchange rates. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative
    financial instruments for trading purposes. We face credit risk
    if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to
    perform their obligations. Our policy is to have counterparties
    to these contracts that are rated at least A- by
    Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s.

We report derivative instruments at fair value and establish
    criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions
    entered into for hedging purposes. Before entering into any
    derivative transaction, we identify our specific financial risk,
    the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce this risk,
    and the correlation between the



SEALED
    AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

Note 2

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued
    Accounting Standards (Continued)

financial risk and the hedging instrument. We use purchase
    orders and historical data as the basis for determining the
    anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged. We do not
    enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high
    correlation with the underlying financial risk we are trying to
    reduce. We regularly review our hedge positions and the
    correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging
    instruments.

We account for derivative instruments as hedges of the related
    underlying risks if we designate these derivative instruments as
    hedges and the derivative instruments are effective as hedges of
    recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions,
    unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany
    transactions.

We record gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash
    flow hedges in other comprehensive income, to the extent that
    hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations, at
    which time we recognize the gains and losses in the consolidated
    statements of operations. We recognize gains and losses on
    qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the
    hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the
    underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated,
    or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no
    longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses
    associated with derivative instruments are recognized on the
    consolidated statements of operations over the period in which
    the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction is
    recognized.

See Note 12, “Derivatives and Hedging
    Activities,” for further details.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize
    valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
    and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
    possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment
    of fair value. We determine fair value of our financial
    instruments based on assumptions that market participants would
    use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most
    advantageous market. When considering market participant
    assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value
    hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable
    inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

•

Level 1 Inputs:

Unadjusted quoted prices
    in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible
    to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

•

Level 2 Inputs:

Other than quoted prices
    included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the
    asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3 Inputs:

Unobservable inputs for
    the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent
    that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for
    situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for
    the asset or liability at measurement date.

Our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are
    subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
    judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our
    estimates. See Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Other Financial Instruments,” for further details on our
    fair value measurements.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

In

non-U.S. locations

that are not considered highly inflationary, we translate the
    balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with
    translation adjustments accumulated in stockholders’ equity
    on our consolidated balance sheets. We translate the statements
    of operations at the average exchange rates during the
    applicable period.



SEALED
    AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

Note 2

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued
    Accounting Standards (Continued)

We translate assets and liabilities of our operations in
    countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of
    period exchange rates, except that nonmonetary asset and
    liability amounts are translated at historical exchange rates.
    In countries with highly inflationary economies, we translate
    items reflected in the statements of operations at average rates
    of exchange prevailing during the period, except that
    nonmonetary amounts are translated at historical exchange rates.

Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as a
    highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP, and the
    U.S. dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional
    currency for our subsidiary in Venezuela. Accordingly, all
    bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were
    re-measured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange
    rate available to us, and any changes in the exchange rate were
    reflected in foreign currency exchange gains or losses related
    to our Venezuelan subsidiary on the consolidated statement of
    operations. All bolivar-denominated nonmonetary assets and
    liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars using the
    historical exchange rates.

The impact to our consolidated financial position and results of
    operations depends on the exchange rates in effect when we enter
    into, remeasure and settle bolivar-denominated transactions.

Commitments
    and Contingencies — Litigation

On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related
    to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is
    typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate
    outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine
    if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the
    settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a
    reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made.
    In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of
    insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we
    believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related
    to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance
    recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved
    for amounts materially different from any provisions or
    disclosures that we have previously made. We expense legal
    costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in
    connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing
    and selling products, and we consider revenues to be earned when
    we have completed the process by which we are entitled to
    receive consideration. The following criteria are used for
    revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement
    exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is fixed or
    determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to
    governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and
    therefore are excluded from net sales on the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Charges for rebates and other allowances are recognized as a
    deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in
    which the associated revenue is recorded. When we estimate our
    rebate accruals, we consider customer-specific contractual
    commitments including stated rebate rates and history of actual
    rebates paid. Our rebate accruals are reviewed at each reporting
    period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. We
    adjust the accruals to reflect any differences between estimated
    and actual amounts. These adjustments impact the amount of net
    sales recognized by us in the period of adjustment. Charges for
    rebates and other allowances were less than 5% of net sales in
    2010, 2009 and 2008.

Our freight costs are included in cost of sales. The amount of
    revenue received for freight re-billed to the customer was
    immaterial in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued
    Accounting Standards (Continued)

Research
    and Development

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Research
    and development costs were $88 million in 2010,
    $81 million in 2009 and $86 million in 2008.

Share-Based
    Incentive Compensation

Our primary share-based employee incentive compensation program
    is the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan. See Note 17,
    “Stockholders’ Equity,” for further information
    on this plan.

We record share-based compensation awards exchanged for employee
    services at fair value on the date of grant and record the
    expense for these awards in marketing, administrative and
    development expense on our consolidated statement of operations
    over the requisite employee service period. Share-based
    incentive compensation expense includes an estimate for
    forfeitures and anticipated achievement levels and is generally
    recognized over the expected term of the award on a
    straight-line basis.

Environmental
    Expenditures

We expense or capitalize environmental expenditures that relate
    to ongoing business activities, as appropriate. We expense costs
    that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations
    and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. We
    record liabilities when we determine that environmental
    assessments or remediation expenditures are probable and that we
    can reasonably estimate the associated cost or a range of costs.

Income
    Taxes

We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Our

non-U.S. subsidiaries

file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions.
    We provide for income taxes on those portions of our foreign
    subsidiaries’ accumulated earnings that we believe are not
    reinvested indefinitely in our businesses. It is not practicable
    to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the
    portion of those accumulated earnings that we believe are
    reinvested indefinitely.

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method
    to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the
    consolidated financial statements. We recognize deferred tax
    assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences
    attributable to differences between the financial statement
    carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards. We
    determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each
    period using enacted tax rates.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only
    if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such positions are measured based
    on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
    likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax
    authorities. We recognize interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense on our
    consolidated statements of operations.

See Note 15, “Income Taxes,” for further
    discussion.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
    equivalents. Our policy is to invest cash in excess of
    short-term operating and debt service requirements in cash
    equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
    approximates fair value because of the short term maturity of
    the instruments. Our policy is to transact with counterparties
    that are rated at least A- by Standard &

Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s. Some of our operations are
    located in countries that are rated below A- or A3. In this
    case, we try to minimize our risk by holding cash and cash
    equivalents at financial institutions with which we have
    existing global relationships whenever possible, diversifying
    counterparty exposures and minimizing the amount held by each
    counterparty and within the country in total.

    of purchase and reassess it as of each balance sheet date.

basis, with the unrealized gains or losses, if any, reported as
    a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, until
    realized. When quoted market values are not available, we
    determine the fair value using other observable or unobservable
    inputs. We recognize realized gains and losses on the sales of
    the securities on a

security-by-security

basis and include the realized gains or losses in other expense,
    net, on the consolidated statements of operations. We determine
    whether a decline in fair value below its cost is temporary or

other-than-temporary.

The objective of

other-than-temporary

impairment analysis under U.S. GAAP is to determine whether
    the holder of an investment in a debt or equity security with a
    decline in its fair value should recognize a loss in earnings
    when the investment is impaired. An investment is impaired if
    the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost.

We include interest and dividends on securities classified as

available-for-sale

in other expense, net, on the consolidated statements of
    operations. See Note 5,

“Available-for-Sale

Investments,” for further discussion of our auction rate
    securities investments and “Fair Value Measurements”
    above for additional information.

Accounts
    Receivable Securitization

Our two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries are parties to
    an accounts receivable securitization program under which they
    sell eligible U.S. accounts receivable to an indirectly
    wholly-owned subsidiary that was formed for the sole purpose of
    entering into this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn
    may sell an undivided ownership interest in these receivables to
    a participating bank or an issuer of commercial paper
    administered by the participating bank. The wholly-owned
    subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the two
    operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells
    ownership interests to the participating bank or to the issuer
    of commercial paper. Before January 1, 2010, if the
    wholly-owned subsidiary sold undivided ownership interests in
    receivables, we removed the transferred ownership interest
    amounts from our balance sheet at the time of the sale and
    reflected the proceeds from the sale in cash provided by
    operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash
    flows.

We reflected retained receivables in receivables, net, on our
    consolidated balance sheets, and the carrying amounts
    approximated fair value because of the relatively short-term
    nature of the receivables. We reflected costs associated with
    the sale of receivables in other expense, net, on the
    consolidated statements of operations.

See “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” below for
    information regarding new accounting standards that changed the
    accounting for this program effective January 1, 2010.

Receivables,
    Net

In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers
    that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable,
    which are included in receivables, net, on the consolidated
    balance sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. We
    maintain accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses
    resulting from the failure of our customers to make required
    payments. An additional allowance may be required if the
    financial condition of our customers deteriorates.

Note 2

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued
    Accounting Standards (Continued)

Inventories

We determine the cost of most U.S. inventories on a

last-in,

first-out or LIFO cost flow basis. The cost of
    U.S. equipment inventories and most

non-U.S. inventories

is determined on a

first-in,

first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. We state inventories at the
    lower of cost or market.

Property
    and Equipment, Net

We state property and equipment at cost, except for property and
    equipment that have been impaired, for which we reduce the
    carrying amount to the estimated fair value at the impairment
    date. We capitalize significant improvements and charge repairs
    and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets
    to expense as incurred. We remove the cost and accumulated
    depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the
    accounts and recognize any resulting gain or loss upon the
    disposition of the assets.

We depreciate the cost of property and equipment over their
    estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:
    buildings — 20 to 40 years; machinery and
    equipment — 5 to 10 years; and other property and
    equipment — 3 to 10 years.

Goodwill
    and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred,
    the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree
    and, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the
    acquisition-date fair value of our previously held equity
    interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date
    amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
    assumed.

We reflect identifiable intangible assets in other assets, net,
    on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets consist
    primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks, customer lists and
    relationships, non-compete agreements and technology based
    intangibles. We amortize identifiable intangible assets over the
    shorter of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated
    useful lives, generally ranging from 3 to 15 years, on a
    straight-line basis to their estimated residual values and
    periodically review them for impairment. Total identifiable
    intangible assets comprise less than 5% of our consolidated
    total assets.

We use the acquisition method of accounting for all business
    combinations and do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets
    with indefinite useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets
    with indefinite useful lives are tested for possible impairment
    annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the asset might be impaired.

See Note 9, “Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets,” for further discussion of our goodwill.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically review long-lived assets other than goodwill for
    impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or
    asset group may not be recoverable. We recognize impairments
    when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from
    long-lived assets are less than their carrying value. For these
    cases, we recognize losses in an amount equal to the difference
    between the fair value and the carrying amount. We record assets
    to be disposed of by sale or abandonment, where management has
    the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at
    the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of
    disposition. We suspend depreciation for these assets during the
    disposal period, which is generally less than one year.
    Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of
    impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on
    operational performances, market conditions and other factors
    and disposition

costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and
    possible impairment expense in our consolidated financial
    statements.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

We recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement
    obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably
    estimated. A conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal
    obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within our control. In addition, we would record a
    corresponding amount by increasing the carrying amount of the
    related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the useful
    life of such long-lived asset.

Self-Insurance

We retain the obligation for specified claims and losses related
    to property, casualty, workers’ compensation and employee
    benefit claims. We accrue for outstanding reported claims and
    claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon
    management’s estimates of the aggregate liability for
    retained losses using historical experience, insurance company
    estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Our
    estimates include management’s and independent insurance
    companies’ assumptions regarding economic conditions, the
    frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns
    and settlement practices. These estimates and assumptions are
    monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and
    are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Although
    management believes it has the ability to adequately project and
    record estimated claim payments, actual results could differ
    significantly from the recorded liabilities.

Pensions

We maintain a qualified non-contributory profit sharing plan and
    qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most
    U.S. employees are eligible to participate. For a limited
    number of our U.S. employees and for some of our
    international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension
    plans. We are required to make assumptions regarding the
    valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance
    of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans.

We review and approve the assumptions made by our actuaries
    regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance
    of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount
    rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future
    rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future
    compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions.
    The measurement date used to determine benefit obligations and
    plan assets is December 31. In general, significant changes
    to these assumptions could have a material impact on the costs
    and liabilities recorded in our consolidated financial
    statements.

Net
    Earnings per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net
    earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Net
    earnings available to common stockholders was adjusted to
    reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of income taxes,
    that would have occurred as a result of the assumed conversion
    of the 3% Convertible Senior Notes for periods prior to the
    redemption of these notes in July 2009.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard
    requiring non-vested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends to be treated as
    participating securities and therefore included in computing
    earnings per common share using the “two-class
    method”. The two-class method is an earnings allocation
    formula that calculates basic and diluted net earnings per
    common share for each class of common stock separately based on
    dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed
    earnings. The non-vested restricted

stock issued under our 2005 Contingent Stock Plan are considered
    participating securities since these securities have
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends when we declare a dividend
    during the contractual vesting period of the share-based payment
    award and therefore included in our earnings allocation formula
    using the two-class method.

When calculating diluted net earnings per common share, the more
    dilutive effect of applying either of the following is
    presented: (a) the two-class method (described above)
    assuming that the participating security is not exercised or
    converted, or, (b) the treasury stock method for the
    participating security. Our diluted net earnings per common
    share for all periods presented were calculated using the
    two-class method since such method was more dilutive.

Our calculation of basic and diluted net earnings per common
    share for 2008 has been adjusted to reflect this change, which
    did not have a material impact.

See Note 18, “Net Earnings Per Common Share,” for
    further discussion.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Unless necessary to clarify a point to readers, we will refrain
    from citing specific topic and section references when
    addressing new or pending accounting standard changes or
    discussing application of U.S. GAAP in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Adopted
    in 2010

In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to accounting
    standards addressing fair value measurements and disclosures
    that  requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about
    recurring and non-recurring fair-value measurements, including
    significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and
    Level 2 fair-value measurements and information about
    purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in
    the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. The
    revised accounting standard also clarifies existing fair-value
    measurement disclosure guidance about the level of
    disaggregation, inputs and valuation techniques. The adoption of
    this new standard in 2010 did not impact our consolidated
    financial position or results of operations as it is
    disclosure-only in nature.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards relating
    to the transfer of financial assets. These standards require
    entities to provide more information regarding sales of
    securitized financial assets and similar transactions,
    particularly if the entity has continuing exposure to the risks
    related to transferred financial assets. They also eliminate the
    concept of a “qualifying special-purpose entity,”
    change the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and
    require additional disclosures. We adopted this standard on
    January 1, 2010. As a result of adopting this standard, any
    future transfers of ownership interests of receivables under our
    accounts receivables securitization program to the issuer of
    commercial paper or to the participating bank are no longer
    considered sales of receivables but are considered secured
    borrowings and will be recorded as liabilities on our
    consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6, “Accounts
    Receivable Securitization Program,” for additional
    information about this program.

Also, in June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting standards
    that change how a company determines when an entity that is
    insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting
    (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of
    whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based
    on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and
    a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. These standards were effective beginning
    January 1, 2010. The adoption of this new standard in 2010
    did not impact our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Adopted
    in 2011

In September 2009, the FASB ratified an amendment to accounting
    standards addressing revenue recognition for arrangements with
    multiple revenue-generating activities. The amendment addresses
    how revenue should be

allocated to separate elements that could impact the timing of
    revenue recognition. The amendment is effective for us on a
    prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified on or after January 1, 2011, and
    earlier application is permitted. We adopted this amendment on
    January 1, 2011 on a prospective basis, and any impact to
    our consolidated financial position and results of operations
    will depend on future revenue arrangements we enter into.
    Currently, we do not believe the adoption of this amendment will
    materially impact our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

    However, we are required to allocate goodwill to each reporting
    unit to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill, which
    we do during the fourth quarter of the year. See Note 9,

    Activities

Global
    Manufacturing Strategy

We announced our global manufacturing strategy program, or GMS,
    in 2006. The goals of this multi-year program were to realign
    our manufacturing footprint to expand capacity in growing
    markets, to further improve our operating efficiencies, and to
    implement new technologies more effectively. Additionally, we
    have been optimizing certain manufacturing platforms in North
    America and Europe into centers of excellence. By taking
    advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a
    global scale, we have continued to enhance our profitable growth
    and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful
    benefits.

In 2009, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Duchnice,
    Poland. This facility along with our other new facilities in
    Qingpu, China and Monterrey, Mexico completed the construction
    phase related to this program.

The capital expenditures, associated costs and related
    restructuring charges, and the cumulative amounts incurred since
    inception of this multi-year strategy to its completion in 2010,
    are included in the table below.

The restructuring and other charges in 2010 were primarily for
    costs for termination benefits, the majority of which were
    related to the Food Packaging segment, mainly resulting from
    additional headcount reductions identified during the completion
    of the program. These charges were included in restructuring and
    other charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See
    Note 3, “Segments,” for restructuring and other
    charges by reportable segment and Other. A reconciliation of the
    restructuring accrual for GMS is included below.

Of the $6.5 million of restructuring and other charges
    related to GMS in 2009, $5.2 million was primarily related
    to ceasing certain operations at one of our German locations and
    the reminder was for costs for termination benefits incurred in
    connection with other projects associated with GMS.

The restructuring and other charges of $19.3 million
    related to this program in 2008 were primarily for costs for
    termination benefits related to our decision to close our
    manufacturing facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This
    facility’s manufacturing operations were moved to existing
    facilities in North America.

The components of the restructuring accrual for GMS through
    December 31, 2010 and the accrual balance remaining on our
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 were as
    follows:

    balance sheet at December 31, 2010. The remaining accrual
    of $0.1 million is expected to be paid in 2012 and is
    included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet
    at December 31, 2010.

European
    Manufacturing Facility Closure

On December 27, 2010, we informed affected employees that
    we would be closing a small industrial shrink packaging
    manufacturing facility in Europe. We are taking this action
    based on our review of operating costs and technology levels in
    an effort to simplify our plant network and improve our
    operating efficiency. We estimate that we will incur total
    associated costs and restructuring and other charges of
    approximately $7 to $9 million in connection with this
    course of action. This course of action is not part of our GMS
    program described above.

Investments (Continued)

In 2010, we sold all five of our auction rate security
    investments. These five investments had a combined total
    original cost of $45 million. At the time we acquired these
    investments through March 2008 they had credit ratings of AA and
    higher by Standard & Poor’s and Aa2 and higher by
    Moody’s. These investments qualified under our policy at
    that time and were viewed as appropriate interest-bearing
    investments for our cash balances. Beginning in 2008 through the
    date of sale of these five securities in the second, third and
    fourth quarters of 2010, we recognized

other-than-temporary

impairments for cumulative pre-tax losses of $39 million.
    Total proceeds received on the sale of these five securities in
    2010 were $13 million, resulting in gains of
    $7 million in 2010. These gains reduced our total
    cumulative pre-tax losses on these investments to
    $32 million ($20 million, net of taxes).

Accounts
    Receivable Securitization Program

We and a group of our U.S. subsidiaries maintain an
    accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an
    issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. As of
    December 31, 2010, the maximum purchase limit for
    receivable interests was $125.0 million, subject to the
    availability limits described below.

The amounts available from time to time under the program may be
    less than $125.0 million due to a number of factors,
    including but not limited to our credit ratings, accounts
    receivable balances, the creditworthiness of our customers and
    our receivables collection experience. During 2010, the level of
    eligible assets available under the program was lower than
    $125.0 million primarily due to our current credit rating.
    As a result, the amount available to us under the program was
    approximately $91 million at December 31, 2010.
    Although we do not believe that these restrictive provisions
    presently materially restrict our operations, if an additional
    event occurs that triggers one of these restrictive provisions,
    we could experience a further decline in the amounts available
    under the program or termination of the program.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no amounts
    outstanding under this program, and we did not utilize this
    program during 2010.

The overall program is scheduled to expire in December 2012;
    however, the program includes a bank financing commitment that
    must be renewed annually. The bank financing commitment is
    scheduled to expire on December 2, 2011. We plan to seek an
    additional 364 day renewal of the bank commitment before
    its expiration. While the bank is not obligated to renew the
    bank financing commitment, we have negotiated annual renewals
    since the commencement of the program in 2001.

Under this receivables program, our two primary operating
    subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US),
    sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to
    Sealed Air Funding Corporation, or SA Funding, an indirectly
    wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that was formed for the sole
    purpose of entering into the receivables program. SA Funding in
    turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables
    to the issuer of commercial paper or to the bank, subject to
    specified conditions, up to a maximum of $125.0 million of
    receivables interests outstanding from time to time.

SA Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the
    operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells
    receivables interests to the purchasers under the program. We
    have structured the sales of accounts receivable by the
    operating subsidiaries to SA Funding and the sales of
    receivables interests from SA Funding to the purchasers

Accounts
    Receivable Securitization Program (Continued)

as “true sales” under applicable laws. The assets of
    SA Funding are not available to pay any of our creditors or
    creditors of other subsidiaries or affiliates.

As a result of our adoption of a new accounting standard related
    to the transfer of financial assets on January 1, 2010, any
    transfers of ownership interests in receivables under this
    program are considered secured borrowings and will be recorded
    as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Also, the
    costs associated with this program related to program fees on
    any outstanding borrowings under this program will now be
    included in interest expense, and the costs related to
    commitment fees on the unused portion of this program will
    continue to be included in other expense, net, on our
    consolidated statements of operations.

To secure the performance of their obligations under the
    receivables program, SA Funding and the operating subsidiaries
    granted a first priority security interest to the bank that is
    acting as administrative agent under the program in accounts
    receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those
    receivables and other collateral. The bank and issuer of
    commercial paper under the program have no recourse to us, the
    operating subsidiaries’ or SA Funding’s other assets
    for any losses resulting from the financial inability of
    customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become
    due. As long as a termination event with respect to the
    receivables program has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries
    service, administer and collect the receivables under the
    receivables program as agents on behalf of SA Funding, the bank
    and the issuer of commercial paper.

Before a termination event under the receivables program, SA
    Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required
    to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper to
    purchase new eligible receivables from the operating
    subsidiaries. We have undertaken to cause the operating
    subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the receivables
    program.

Under limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer of
    commercial paper can end purchases of receivables interests
    before the above dates. A downgrade of our long-term senior
    unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard &
    Poor’s Rating Services or Ba3 or below by Moody’s
    Investors Service, Inc., or failure to comply with interest
    coverage, debt leverage ratios or various other ratios related
    to our receivables collection experience could result in
    termination of the receivables program. We were in compliance
    with both the credit rating provisions and these ratios at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Other expense, net, includes the costs associated with our
    receivables securitization program. These costs primarily relate
    to commitment fees, other associated costs and the losses on the
    sale of the undivided ownership interests in 2009 and 2008. The
    following table details our costs associated with our
    receivables securitization program for the three years ended in
    December 31, 2010.

We test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis
    annually during the fourth quarter of each year and at other
    times if events or circumstances exist that indicate the
    carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable. During
    2010, we determined that there were no events or changes in
    circumstances that had occurred that would indicate that the
    fair value of any of our reporting units may be below its
    carrying value.

    Annual Goodwill Impairment Test

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed step one of our
    annual impairment test and fair value analysis for goodwill, and
    there were no impairments present and no impairment charge was
    recorded. We had the estimated fair values updated for all of
    our reporting units, except for the New Ventures reporting unit
    because this reporting unit does not have any goodwill included
    in its net asset value.

The excess of estimated fair values over carrying value,
    including goodwill, for each of our reporting units as of the
    2010 annual test date were the following:

    equity market conditions, a decline in

    to economic or competitive conditions, or a more-likely-than-not
    expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a
    reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, could require an
    interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units before
    the next required annual assessment. In the event of significant
    adverse changes of the nature described above, we might have to
    recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill, which could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations.

    Notes

    Activity

Partial
    Redemption of 12% Senior Notes due 2014

In December 2010, we completed an early redemption of
    $150 million of the outstanding $300 million principal
    amount of our 12% Senior Notes due February 14, 2014
    at the request of Davis Selected Advisers, L.P. We redeemed
    these notes at fair value. The aggregate redemption price was
    $196 million, which included the principal amount of
    $150 million, a 27% premium of $41 million and accrued
    interest of $5 million. We funded the redemption with
    available cash. We recognized a net pre-tax loss of
    $39 million, which included the premium mentioned above,
    less a gain of $2 million on the termination of a related
    interest rate swap.

We issued these notes in February 2009 for an aggregate
    principal amount of $300 million in a private offering. The
    notes were sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement dated
    February 6, 2009 by and among us, subsidiaries of Berkshire
    Hathaway Inc. and Davis Selected Advisers, L.P.

These notes were sold to the purchasers at a price of 100% of
    the principal amount. Interest on the notes is payable
    semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each
    year, commencing on August 15, 2009. These senior notes
    rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated
    indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The indenture
    imposes limitations on our operations and those of specified
    subsidiaries that are substantially equivalent to those
    contained in the indentures relating to our other outstanding
    senior notes and discussed below under “Covenants.”
    The indenture does not allow us to redeem these notes prior to
    their maturity.

    Activity

Redemption
    of 3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033

In July 2009, we redeemed the entire $431.3 million of our
    3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2033. The total redemption
    cash payment of $434 million included a 0.429% call premium
    of $2 million and accrued interest of $1 million. We
    used net proceeds of $384 million from the June 2009
    issuance of 7.875% Senior Notes due June 2017 plus
    available cash of $50 million to redeem these senior notes.
    In connection with the redemption, we recorded a $3 million
    pre-tax loss on the redemption of debt in the third quarter of
    2009. This loss represented the 0.429% call premium mentioned
    above and a write-down of the remaining debt issuance costs of
    $1 million related to the issuance of these senior notes in
    July 2003.

Issuance
    of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2017

In June 2009, we completed an offering of $400 million of
    senior unsecured notes due 2017 with a coupon of 7.875%. The net
    proceeds from this issuance after deducting the discount of
    $9 million and debt issuance costs of $7 million were
    $384 million. These senior notes rank equally with all of
    our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to
    time outstanding. Interest on these notes is payable
    semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
    commencing on December 15, 2009.

At any time prior to June 15, 2013, we may redeem these
    notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption
    price equal to the greater of (i) 101% of the principal
    amount of the notes being redeemed or (ii) the sum



SEALED

of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
    principal and interest on the notes being redeemed from the
    redemption date to the maturity date. On or after June 15,
    2013, we may redeem all or part of these notes at a price equal
    to 103.938% of their aggregate principal amount, declining to
    101.969% on June 15, 2014 and 100% on June 15, 2015.
    In addition, at any time prior to June 15, 2012, we may
    redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of these
    notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings.

The indenture imposes limitations on our operations and those of
    specified subsidiaries that are substantially equivalent to
    those in the indentures relating to our other outstanding senior
    notes and discussed below under “Covenants.”

Retirement
    of 6.95% Senior Notes

In May 2009, we retired the remaining outstanding
    6.95% Senior Notes on their maturity date. The
    $137 million face value of these senior notes, along with
    $5 million of accrued interest, was paid primarily with
    available cash.

    Activity

Maturity
    of 5.375% Senior Notes

On April 15, 2008, our 5.375% Senior Notes with a face
    value of $300.0 million matured. We used
    $165.0 million of funds drawn under the global credit
    facility and $135.0 million from the sale of receivable
    interests under our accounts receivable securitization program
    to retire this debt.

Global
    Credit Facility

The global credit facility is available for general corporate
    purposes, including the payment of amounts required to be paid
    upon the effectiveness of the Settlement agreement discussed in
    Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies.” We may
    re-borrow amounts repaid under the facility from time to time
    before its expiration or

earlier termination. Our obligations under the facility bear
    interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by
    adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
    interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The
    facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on our
    long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. The facility has an
    expiration date of July 26, 2012. As of December 31,
    2010, the total amount available under the global credit
    facility was $472 million.

Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0.20% per annum on the
    total amounts available under the global credit facility. The
    facility provides for changes in fees based on our long-term
    senior unsecured debt ratings. Also, certain
    U.S. subsidiaries would be required to guarantee
    obligations under the facility if our long-term senior unsecured
    debt ratings by both Moody’s and Standard &
    Poor’s are below investment grade.

The terms of our global credit facility and our European credit
    facility, discussed below, include a requirement that, upon the
    occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the
    Settlement agreement or would materially increase our liability
    in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability
    arising from the Cryovac transaction, we would be required to
    repay any amounts outstanding under these facilities or
    refinance these facilities within 60 days.

While the current total amount available for borrowing under the
    global credit facility is $472 million, the facility also
    provides a mechanism to increase the total facility size to a
    maximum of $750 million. This does not represent a
    commitment by the lenders to increase the facility size; rather,
    it provides us with a simplified method of requesting an
    increase at a later date if desired and market conditions
    permit. The potential increased facility size is not included in
    the available lines of credit table above.

During 2009, we borrowed funds from time to time under this
    facility. Interest expense related to the funds drawn in 2009
    was $0.2 million. The related weighted average interest
    rate for these borrowings was 1.7%. At December 31, 2009
    there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. We did
    not utilize this facility in 2010, and there were no amounts
    outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2010.

European
    Credit Facility

We have a €150 million European credit facility, which
    was equivalent to U.S. $197 million at
    December 31, 2010. The facility has an expiration date of
    July 26, 2012. A syndicate of banks made this facility
    available to Sealed Air and a group of our European subsidiaries
    for general corporate purposes, including the payment of amounts
    required to be paid upon effectiveness of the Settlement
    agreement. The terms of this facility are substantially similar
    to the terms of our global credit facility. We may re-borrow
    amounts repaid under the European credit facility from time to
    time before the expiration or earlier termination of the
    facility.

As of December 31, 2009, we had an outstanding balance of
    €45 million, which was equivalent to
    U.S. $64 million. We repaid this outstanding balance
    in January 2010. Interest expense related to the funds drawn in
    2009 under this facility was $0.1 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2010 resulting in a weighted average interest
    rate of 3.625%. We did not borrow any amounts under this
    facility in 2010, and there were no amounts outstanding under
    this facility at December 31, 2010.

Note 12

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

We report all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at
    fair value and establish criteria for designation and
    effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes.

As a large global organization, we face exposure to market
    risks, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
    and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these
    exposures, we enter into various derivative instruments from
    time to time under our risk management policies. We designate
    derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to
    support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these
    hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding
    changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying
    exposures being hedged. We assess the initial and ongoing
    effectiveness of our hedging relationships in accordance with
    our policy. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative
    financial instruments for trading purposes. Our practice is to
    terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or
    liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if we determine
    the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of
    occurring.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities (Continued)

Foreign
    Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as
    Hedges

Our subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from
    buying and selling in currencies other than their functional
    currencies. The primary purposes of our foreign currency hedging
    activities are to manage the potential changes in value
    associated with the amounts receivable or payable on
    transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to minimize
    the impact of the changes in foreign currencies related to
    foreign currency denominated interest-bearing intercompany loans
    and receivables and payables. The changes in fair value of these
    contracts are recognized in other expense, net, on our
    consolidated statements of operations and are largely offset by
    the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated
    items indicated above. These contracts have original maturities
    of less than 12 months.

The estimated fair value of these contracts, which represents
    the estimated net payments that would be paid or that would be
    received by us in the event of their termination, based on the
    then current foreign currency exchange rates, was a net current
    liability of $0.3 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $4 million at December 31, 2009. Any related net gains
    and losses were largely offset by the net losses and gains
    resulting from the remeasurement of the underlying foreign
    currency denominated transactions.

Foreign
    Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow
    Hedges

The primary purposes of our cash flow hedging activities are to
    manage the potential changes in value associated with the
    amounts receivable or payable on equipment and raw material
    purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to
    minimize the impact of the changes in foreign currencies. We
    record gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts
    qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income to
    the extent that these hedges are effective and until we
    recognize the underlying transactions in net earnings, at which
    time we recognize these gains and losses in other expense, net,
    on our consolidated statements of operations.

Net unrealized after tax gains (losses) related to these
    contracts that were included in other comprehensive income for
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were immaterial.
    The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income will
    fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts
    during each reporting period.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps to manage our
    mix of fixed and floating rates on outstanding indebtedness.

At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding interest rate
    swaps related to our 12% Senior Notes and our
    5.625% Senior Notes with a total notional amount of
    $200 million that qualified and were designated as fair
    value hedges. We entered into these interest rate swaps to
    effectively convert these senior notes into floating rate debt.
    We recorded a mark to market adjustment to record an increase of
    $6 million at December 31, 2010 in the carrying amount
    of these senior notes due to changes in interest rates and an
    offsetting increase to other assets at December 31, 2010 to
    record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There
    was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings
    during the period.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we terminated an interest rate
    swap with a notional amount of $50 million in connection
    with the partial redemption of the 12% Senior Notes. As a
    result, we received cash of $2 million related to this
    termination and recognized a gain of $2 million which
    partially offset the loss on debt redemption on the consolidated
    statement of operations.

At December 31, 2009, we recorded a mark to market
    adjustment to record a decrease of $0.5 million in the
    carrying amount of the 12% Senior Notes due to changes in
    interest rates and an offsetting increase to other

    and Hedging Activities (Continued)

liabilities at December 31, 2009 to record the fair value
    of the related interest rate swaps. There was no ineffective
    portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the period.

Under the terms of most of our outstanding interest rate swap
    agreements in 2010 and all of our outstanding interest rate swap
    agreements in 2009 we received interest at a fixed rate and paid
    interest at variable rates that were based on the one-month
    London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. The remaining portion
    of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements in 2010 were
    based on the six-month LIBOR. As a result of our interest rate
    swap agreements, interest expense was reduced by $5 million
    in 2010 and $2 million in 2009.

Other
    Derivative Instruments

We may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such
    as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to foreign
    exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to
    access to international financing transactions. These
    instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by
    swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings
    denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, we had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and
    currency swap agreements outstanding.

See Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and Other
    Financial Instruments,” for a discussion of the inputs and
    valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of our
    outstanding derivative instruments.

Cash
    Equivalents

Our cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 consisted of
    investments in U.S. Treasury obligations (fair value
    determined using Level 1 inputs) and commercial paper (fair
    value determined using Level 2 inputs). Our cash
    equivalents at December 31, 2009 consisted of investments
    in commercial paper (fair value determined using Level 2
    inputs). Since these are short-term highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less at the date of
    purchase, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value
    due to changes in interest rates.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Our foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair
    value on our consolidated balance sheets using an income
    approach valuation technique based on observable market inputs
    (Level 2).

Observable market inputs used in the calculation of the fair
    value of foreign currency forward contracts include foreign
    currency spot and forward rates obtained from an independent
    third party market data provider. In addition, other pricing
    data quoted by various banks and foreign currency dealers
    involving identical or comparable instruments are included.

Our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on our
    consolidated balance sheet using an income approach valuation
    technique based on observable market inputs (Level 2).
    Observable market inputs used in the calculation of the fair
    value of interest rate swaps include pricing data from
    counterparties to these swaps, and a comparison is made to other
    market data including U.S. Treasury yields and swap spreads
    involving identical or comparable derivative instruments.

Counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts and
    interest rate swaps are rated at least A- by
    Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s. The
    fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we
    would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting
    date.

Other
    Financial Instruments

The following financial instruments are recorded at fair value
    or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) receivables,
    net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts
    payable and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying
    amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheets for the
    above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value
    due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.

Other liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our
    consolidated balance sheets include our senior notes. To
    calculate the fair value of our senior notes at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, we utilized a market approach.
    Due to their limited investor base and the relatively small face
    value of each issue of the senior notes, they may not be
    actively traded on the date the fair value is calculated.
    Therefore, we utilize prices and other relevant information
    generated by market

transactions involving similar securities, reflecting
    U.S. Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and
    the price on each of our senior notes. These inputs are provided
    by an independent third party and are considered to be
    Level 2 inputs.

We derived the fair value estimates of our various other debt
    instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each
    instrument, considering prevailing economic and market
    conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at
    the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our credit default
    swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of
    each debt instrument, as applicable.

These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and
    matters of significant judgment, and therefore we cannot
    determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could
    significantly affect our estimates.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our total debt

Credit
    and Market Risk

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to
    counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk
    related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We
    manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific
    minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and
    procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.

We do not expect any of our counterparties in derivative
    transactions to fail to perform as it is our policy to have
    counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least A- by
    Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s.
    Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses
    arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the
    counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their
    obligations.

We regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value
    and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments
    considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency
    exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial
    instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative
    financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
    and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base
    of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course
    of business and generally do not require collateral. We consider
    the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade
    accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe
    that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to
    significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms
    and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate
    concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our
    sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a
    small group of customers.

    Plans

Profit
    Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans

We have a qualified non-contributory profit sharing plan
    covering most of our U.S. employees. Contributions to this
    plan, which are made at the discretion of our Board of
    Directors, may be made in cash, shares of our common stock, or
    in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We also
    maintain qualified contributory retirement savings plans in
    which most of our U.S. employees are eligible to
    participate. The qualified contributory retirement savings plans
    generally provide for our contributions in cash based upon the
    amount contributed to the plans by the participants. Our
    contributions to or provisions for the profit sharing plan and
    retirement savings plans are charged to operations and amounted
    to $27 million in 2010, $38 million in 2009 and
    $25 million in 2008. We contributed approximately
    0.3 million shares in 2010 and 0.5 million shares in
    2009 of our common stock as part of our contribution to the
    profit sharing plan. These shares were issued out of treasury
    stock. In 2008, there were no shares of common stock issued for
    our contribution to the profit sharing plan.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

We recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit
    plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan
    assets and the projected benefit obligations of the employee
    benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheet, with a
    corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    loss, net of taxes. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an
    asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability on
    our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes in the
    funded status are recognized in unrecognized pension items, a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, that is
    included in total stockholders’ equity. The amount of
    unamortized pension items is recorded net of tax. The
    measurement date used by us to determine projected benefit
    obligations and plan assets is December 31.

United

A limited number of our U.S. employees, including some
    employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements,

Plan
    Assets

We review the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    annually, taking into consideration our asset allocation,
    historical returns, and the current economic environment.

Our long-term objectives for plan investments are to ensure that
    (a) there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit
    obligations to participants over the life of the plans,
    (b) there is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover
    current benefit obligations, and (c) there is a high level
    of investment return consistent with a prudent level of
    investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a
    long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy
    with short-term volatility less than that of a pure equity
    strategy. To accomplish this objective, we cause assets to be
    invested in a balanced and diversified mix of equity and fixed
    income investments. The target asset allocation will typically
    be

50-65%

in
    equity securities, with a maximum equity allocation of 75%, and

35-50%

in
    fixed income securities, with a minimum fixed income allocation
    of 25% including cash.

    Postretirement Benefit Plans

We generally do not offer our employees postretirement benefits
    other than programs that are required by the foreign countries
    in which we operate. In the U.S., we offer a postretirement
    healthcare program that is fully funded by the participating
    retired employees, except as noted below. These programs are not
    material to our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Since March 31, 1998, we have offered to some
    U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging business a fixed
    subsidy applicable to participation in our
    U.S. postretirement healthcare program. The accrued benefit
    liability associated with these subsidies amounted to
    $3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The net
    periodic postretirement expense and credit components, together
    with other remaining postretirement healthcare plans, are not
    material to our consolidated financial statements.

(1)

This deferred tax asset reflects the cash portion of the
    Settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the fair
    market value of 18 million shares of our common stock at a
    post-split price of $17.86 per share based on the price when the
    Settlement agreement was reached in 2002. However, the value of
    this deferred tax asset will depend on the price of our common
    stock at the time it is issued under the Settlement agreement.
    See Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” for
    further discussion.

Based upon anticipated future results, we have concluded that it
    is more likely than not that we will realize the
    $446 million balance of deferred tax assets at
    December 31, 2010, net of the valuation allowance of
    $43 million. The valuation allowance is related to the
    uncertainty of utilizing $123 million of foreign net
    operating loss carry forwards, or $34 million on a
    tax-effected basis, most of which have no expiration period, and
    $37 million of foreign investment tax allowances, or
    $9 million on a tax-effected basis, that have no expiration
    period.

Net deferred income taxes (credited) charged to
    stockholders’ equity were $(5) million in 2010,
    $4 million in 2009 and $(6) million in 2008.

If the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 were
    recognized, our income tax provision would decrease by
    $65 million, resulting in a substantially lower effective
    tax rate. The great majority of our unrecognized tax benefits
    relate to the Settlement agreement. As described in
    Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in 2011
    the Bankruptcy Court has taken various actions with respect to
    the PI Settlement Plan. Although we do not know whether or when
    a final plan of reorganization will become effective, it is
    reasonably possible that within the next 12 months our
    unrecognized tax benefit position will decrease because of
    recognizing most of the unrecognized tax benefits relating to
    the Settlement agreement.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in income tax provision on the consolidated statements
    of operations. We had a liability of approximately
    $3 million (of which $2 million represents penalties)
    at January 1, 2010 and a liability of $4 million (of
    which $2 million represents penalties) at December 31,
    2010 for the payment of interest and penalties (before any tax
    benefit). In 2010, interest and penalties of $1 million
    (gross) ($0.7 million (net)) were recognized in connection
    with the related tax accruals for

uncertainties in prior years. In addition, interest and
    penalties of $1 million (gross) ($0.5 million (net))
    were reversed in connection with the related tax accruals for
    uncertainties in prior years.

Income
    Tax Returns

The Internal Revenue Service has concluded its examination of
    our U.S. federal income tax returns for all years through
    2006.

State income tax returns are generally subject to examination
    for a period of three to five years after their filing date. We
    have various state income tax returns in the process of
    examination.

Income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions have statutes of
    limitations generally ranging from three to five years after
    their filing date. The income tax returns filed by our major
    foreign entities are open to possible examination beginning with
    the year shown in parentheses in the following countries:
    Australia (2006), Brazil (2005), Canada (2004), France (2008),
    Germany (2004), Italy (2006), Malaysia (2003), Mexico (2003),
    Netherlands (2008), New Zealand (2005), Spain (2005),
    Switzerland (2009) and the UK (2007). Our foreign income
    tax returns are under examination in various jurisdictions in
    which we conduct business and we are litigating certain issues
    in several jurisdictions.

Cryovac
    Transaction Commitments and Contingencies

Settlement
    Agreement and Related Costs

On November 27, 2002, we reached an agreement in principle
    with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in
    the bankruptcy case of W. R. Grace & Co., known as
    Grace, to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims
    made against the Company and our affiliates in connection with
    the Cryovac transaction described below (as memorialized by the
    parties in the Settlement agreement and as approved by the
    Bankruptcy Court, the “Settlement agreement”). The
    Settlement agreement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer
    claims and successor liability claims, as well as
    indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc.
    and affiliated companies, in connection with the Cryovac
    transaction. On December 3, 2002, our Board of Directors
    approved the agreement in principle. We received notice that
    both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle
    as of December 5, 2002. The parties subsequently signed the
    definitive Settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003
    consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. For a
    description of the Cryovac transaction, asbestos-related claims
    and the parties involved, see “Cryovac Transaction”
    “Discussion of Cryovac Transaction Commitments and
    Contingencies,” “Fresenius Claims,”
    “Canadian Claims” and “Additional Matters Related
    to the Cryovac Transaction” below.

We recorded a pre-tax charge of $850.1 million as a result
    of the Settlement agreement on our consolidated statement of
    operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. The charge
    consisted of the following items:

•

a charge of $512.5 million covering a cash payment that we
    will be required to make under the Settlement agreement upon the
    effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the
    Grace bankruptcy. Because we cannot predict when a plan of
    reorganization may become effective, we recorded this liability
    as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2002. Under the terms of the Settlement
    agreement, this amount accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate
    from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. We have
    recorded this interest in interest expense on our consolidated
    statements of operations and in Settlement agreement and related
    accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheets. The accrued
    interest, which is compounded annually, was $275 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $234 million at
    December 31, 2009.

a non-cash charge of $321.5 million representing the fair
    market value at the date we recorded the charge of nine million
    shares of Sealed Air common stock that we expect to issue under
    the Settlement agreement upon the effectiveness of an
    appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy,
    which was adjusted to eighteen million shares due to our

two-for-one

stock split in March 2007. These shares are subject to customary
    anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock
    splits, stock dividends and other events affecting our common
    stock. The fair market value of our common stock was $35.72 per
    pre-split share ($17.86 post-split) as of the close of business
    on December 5, 2002. We recorded this amount on our
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002 as follows:
    $0.9 million representing the aggregate par value of these
    shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the
    Settlement agreement, and the remaining $320.6 million,
    representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over
    the aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional
    paid-in capital. The diluted net earnings per common share
    calculations for the December 31, 2010 and 2009 periods
    reflect the eighteen million shares of common stock that we have
    reserved for issuance related to the Settlement agreement.

Cryovac
    Transaction

On March 31, 1998, we completed a multi-step transaction
    that brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former
    Sealed Air Corporation’s business under the common
    ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as
    subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding
    company. As part of that transaction, the parties separated the
    Cryovac packaging business, which previously had been held by
    various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, from
    the remaining businesses previously held by the Company. The
    parties then arranged for the contribution of these remaining
    businesses to a company now known as W. R. Grace &
    Co., and the Company distributed the Grace shares to the
    Company’s stockholders. As a result, W. R.
    Grace & Co. became a separate publicly owned company.
    The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock
    into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A
    subsidiary of the Company then merged into the former Sealed Air
    Corporation, which became a subsidiary of the Company and
    changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation (US).

Discussion
    of Cryovac Transaction Commitments and Contingencies

In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and its
    subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their
    operations before the Cryovac transaction, whether accruing or
    occurring before or after the Cryovac transaction, other than
    liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac’s
    operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are
    liabilities relating to asbestos-containing products previously
    manufactured or sold by Grace’s subsidiaries prior to the
    Cryovac transaction, including its primary U.S. operating
    subsidiary, W. R. Grace & Co. — Conn., which
    has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace
    since the Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction
    agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to hold the
    Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities
    retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the
    asbestos-related liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries would
    indemnify and defend us.

Since the beginning of 2000, we have been served with a number
    of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac
    transaction, we are responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities
    of Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as
    co-defendants in some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are
    several purported class actions and a number of personal injury
    lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or
    wrongful

death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental
    remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product.
    Neither the former Sealed Air Corporation nor Cryovac, Inc. ever
    produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that
    are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has reached
    resolution through judgment, settlement or otherwise. As
    discussed below, Grace’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy
    proceeding has stayed all of these cases.

While the allegations in these actions directed to us vary,
    these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the
    Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction was a
    fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a
    theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against
    Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold us liable for
    liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted
    prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R. Grace &
    Co. — Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer
    would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less
    than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was
    insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged
    or was about to engage in a business for which its assets
    constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or
    believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as
    they mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made
    with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If a
    court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac
    transaction to be fraudulent transfers, we could be required to
    return the property or its value to the transferor or could be
    required to fund liabilities of Grace or its subsidiaries for
    the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos claimants. We
    have reached an agreement in principle and subsequently signed
    the Settlement agreement, described below, that is expected to
    resolve all these claims.

In the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective
    stockholders in connection with the Cryovac transaction, both
    parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief that
    Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would
    be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that
    none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac
    transaction would be a fraudulent transfer. They also stated
    their belief that the Cryovac transaction complied with other
    relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal
    standards had reached conclusions adverse to us, these
    determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

On April 2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries
    filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
    the District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made
    in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims
    since 1999.

In connection with its Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an
    application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among
    others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
    subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace
    and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The
    court issued an order dated May 3, 2001, which was modified
    on January 22, 2002, under which the court stayed all the
    filed or pending asbestos actions against us and, upon filing
    and service on us, all future asbestos actions. No further
    proceedings involving us can occur in the actions that have been
    stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court.

Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in
    Grace’s bankruptcy case received the court’s
    permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims
    against the Company and its subsidiary Cryovac, Inc., and
    against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against
    Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius
    and W. R. Grace & Co. — Conn. Fresenius is
    not affiliated with us. In March 2002, the court ordered that
    the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Cryovac
    transaction and whether Grace received reasonably equivalent
    value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all
    of Grace’s creditors. This proceeding was brought in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Adv.

No. 02-02210).

In June 2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to
    intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding,
    so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that
    environmental remediation expenses were underestimated or
    omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time
    of the Cryovac transaction. The court also permitted Grace,
    which asserted that the Cryovac transaction was not a fraudulent
    transfer, to intervene in

    and Contingencies (Continued)

the proceeding. In July 2002, the court issued an interim ruling
    on the legal standards to be applied in the trial, holding,
    among other things, that, subject to specified limitations,
    post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis
    of Grace. We believe that only claims and liabilities that were
    known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time of the
    1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the
    applicable standard.

With the fraudulent transfer trial set to commence on
    December 9, 2002, on November 27, 2002, we reached an
    agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting the
    claims against the Company and Cryovac, Inc., to resolve all
    current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the
    Cryovac transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order
    confirming that the parties had reached an amicable resolution
    of the disputes among the parties and that counsel for us and
    the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of
    the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in
    principle called for payment of nine million shares of our
    common stock and $512.5 million in cash, plus interest on
    the cash payment at a 5.5% annual rate starting on
    December 21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of an
    appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy, when
    we are required to make the payment. These shares are subject to
    customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects
    of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting our
    common stock, and as a result, the number of shares of our
    common stock that we will issue increased to eighteen million
    shares upon the

two-for-one

stock split in March 2007. On December 3, 2002, the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the agreement in
    principle. We received notice that both of the Committees had
    approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002.
    The parties subsequently signed the definitive Settlement
    agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent with the terms
    of the agreement in principle. On November 26, 2003, the
    parties jointly presented the definitive Settlement agreement to
    the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for
    approval. On Grace’s motion to the U.S. District
    Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the
    Settlement agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition.

On June 27, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court signed an order
    approving the Settlement agreement. Although Grace is not a
    party to the Settlement agreement, under the terms of the order,
    Grace is directed to comply with the Settlement agreement
    subject to limited exceptions. The order also provides that the
    Court will retain jurisdiction over any dispute involving the
    interpretation or enforcement of the terms and provisions of the
    Settlement agreement. We expect that the Settlement agreement
    will become effective upon Grace’s emergence from
    bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization that is
    consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement.

On June 8, 2004, we filed a motion with the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where the
    fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the court
    vacate the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be
    applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against us.
    We were not challenging the Settlement agreement. The motion was
    filed as a protective measure in the event that the Settlement
    agreement is ultimately not approved or implemented; however, we
    still expect that the Settlement agreement will become effective
    upon Grace’s emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of
    reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the
    Settlement agreement.

On July 11, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
    closing the proceeding brought in 2002 by the committees
    appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the Grace
    bankruptcy proceeding against us without prejudice to our right
    to reopen the matter and renew in our sole discretion our motion
    to vacate the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to
    be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against us.

As a condition to our obligation to make the payments required
    by the Settlement agreement, any final plan of reorganization
    must be consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement,
    including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to
    below and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any
    asbestos-related claims against us. The Settlement agreement
    provides that, upon the effective date of the final plan of
    reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present
    and future asbestos-related claims against us that arise from
    alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its affiliates
    (including former affiliates that became our affiliates through
    the Cryovac

transaction) will be channeled to and become the responsibility
    of one or more trusts to be established under
    Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code as part of a final
    plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. The Settlement
    agreement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims
    against us arising from the Cryovac transaction as well as the
    Fresenius claims described below. The Settlement agreement
    provides that we will receive releases of all those claims upon
    payment. Under the agreement, we cannot seek indemnity from
    Grace for our payments required by the Settlement agreement. The
    order approving the Settlement agreement also provides that the
    stay of proceedings involving us described above will continue
    through the effective date of the final plan of reorganization,
    after which, upon implementation of the Settlement agreement, we
    will be released from the liabilities asserted in those
    proceedings and their continued prosecution against us will be
    enjoined.

In January 2005, Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization
    (the “Grace Plan”) with the Bankruptcy Court. There
    were a number of objections filed. The Official Committee of
    Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants (the “ACC”) and the
    Asbestos PI Future Claimants’ Representative (the
    “FCR”) filed their proposed plan of reorganization
    (the “Claimants’ Plan”) with the Bankruptcy Court
    in November 2007. On April 7, 2008, Grace issued a press
    release announcing that Grace, the ACC, the FCR, and the
    Official Committee of Equity Security Holders (the “Equity
    Committee”) had reached an agreement in principle to settle
    all present and future asbestos-related personal injury claims
    against Grace (the “PI Settlement”) and disclosed a
    term sheet outlining certain terms of the PI Settlement and for
    a contemplated plan of reorganization that would incorporate the
    PI Settlement (as filed and amended from time to time, the
    “PI Settlement Plan”).

On September 19, 2008, Grace, the ACC, the FCR, and the
    Equity Committee filed, as co-proponents, the PI Settlement Plan
    and several exhibits and associated documents, including a
    disclosure statement (as filed and amended from time to time,
    the “PI Settlement Disclosure Statement”), with the
    Bankruptcy Court. Amended versions of the PI Settlement Plan and
    the PI Settlement Disclosure Statement have been filed with the
    Bankruptcy Court from time to time. The PI Settlement Plan,
    which supersedes each of the Grace Plan and the Claimants’
    Plan, remains pending and has not become effective. The
    committee representing general unsecured creditors and the
    Official Committee of Asbestos Property Damage Claimants are not
    co-proponents of the PI Settlement Plan. As filed, the PI
    Settlement Plan would provide for the establishment of two
    asbestos trusts under Section 524(g) of the United States
    Bankruptcy Code to which present and future asbestos-related
    claims would be channeled. The PI Settlement Plan also
    contemplates that the terms of the Settlement agreement will be
    incorporated into the PI Settlement Plan and that we will pay
    the amount contemplated by the Settlement agreement. On
    March 9, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
    approving the PI Settlement Disclosure Statement (the “DS
    Order”) as containing adequate information and authorizing
    Grace to solicit votes to accept or reject the PI Settlement
    Plan, all as more fully described in the order. The DS Order
    does not constitute the Bankruptcy Court’s confirmation of
    the PI Settlement Plan, approval of the merits of the PI
    Settlement Plan, or endorsement of the PI Settlement Plan. In
    connection with the plan voting process in the Grace bankruptcy
    case, we have voted in favor of the PI Settlement Plan that is
    currently before the Bankruptcy Court. We will continue to
    review any amendments to the PI Settlement Plan on an ongoing
    basis to verify compliance with the Settlement agreement.

On June 8, 2009, a senior manager with the voting agent
    appointed in the Grace bankruptcy case filed a declaration with
    the Bankruptcy Court certifying the voting results with respect
    to the PI Settlement Plan. This declaration was amended on
    August 5, 2009 (as amended, the “Voting
    Declaration”). According to the Voting Declaration, with
    respect to each class of claims designated as impaired by Grace,
    the PI Settlement Plan has been approved by holders of at least
    two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number (or for
    classes voting for purposes of Section 524(g) of the
    Bankruptcy Code, at least 75% in number) of voted claims. The
    Voting Declaration also discusses the voting results with
    respect to holders of general unsecured claims
    (“GUCs”) against Grace, whose votes have been
    provisionally solicited and counted subject to a determination
    by the Bankruptcy Court of whether GUCs are impaired (and, thus,
    entitled to vote) or, as Grace contends, unimpaired (and, thus,
    not entitled to vote). The Voting Declaration provides that more
    than one half of voting holders of GUCs have voted to



SEALED
    AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

    and Contingencies (Continued)

accept the PI Settlement Plan, but that the provisional vote has
    not obtained the requisite two-thirds dollar amount to be deemed
    an accepting class in the event that GUCs are determined to be
    impaired. To the extent that GUCs are determined to be an
    impaired non-accepting class, Grace and the other plan
    proponents have indicated that they would nevertheless seek
    confirmation of the PI Settlement Plan under the “cram
    down” provisions contained in section 1129(b) of the
    Bankruptcy Code.

On January 31, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court entered a
    memorandum opinion (the “Memorandum Opinion”)
    overruling certain objections to the PI Settlement Plan and
    finding, among other things, that GUCs are not impaired under
    the PI Settlement Plan. On the same date, the Bankruptcy Court
    entered an order regarding confirmation of the PI Settlement
    Plan (the “Confirmation Order”). As entered on
    January 31, 2011, the Confirmation Order contained
    recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law, and
    recommended that the U.S. District Court for the District
    of Delaware (the “District Court”) approve the
    Confirmation Order, and that the District Court confirm the PI
    Settlement Plan and issue a channeling injunction under
    Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. Thereafter, on
    February 15, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order
    clarifying its Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation Order (the
    “Clarifying Order”). Among other things, the
    Clarifying Order provided that any references in the Memorandum
    Opinion and Confirmation Order to a recommendation that the
    District Court confirm the PI Settlement Plan were thereby
    amended to make clear that the PI Settlement Plan was confirmed
    and that the Bankruptcy Court was requesting that the District
    Court issue and affirm the Confirmation Order including the
    injunction under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Although we are optimistic that, if it were to become effective,
    the PI Settlement Plan would implement the terms of the
    Settlement agreement, we can give no assurance that this will be
    the case notwithstanding the Bankruptcy Court’s
    confirmation of the PI Settlement Plan. The terms of the PI
    Settlement Plan remain subject to amendment. Moreover, the PI
    Settlement Plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of
    conditions which are more fully set forth in the PI Settlement
    Plan and include, without limitation, the availability of exit
    financing and the approval of the PI Settlement Plan by the
    District Court. Additionally, various parties have filed notices
    of appeal or have otherwise challenged the Memorandum Opinion
    and Confirmation Order, and the PI Settlement Plan may be
    subject to further appeal or challenge by additional parties.
    Parties filed a number of objections to the PI Settlement Plan,
    and some of these objections concerned injunctions, releases and
    provisions as applied to us

and/or

that
    are contemplated by the Settlement agreement. Such parties (or
    others) may appeal or otherwise challenge the Bankruptcy
    Court’s Memorandum Opinion and Confirmation Order, or
    otherwise continue to oppose the PI Settlement Plan.

While the Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the PI Settlement Plan,
    additional proceedings may be held before the District Court or
    other courts to consider matters related to the PI Settlement
    Plan. We do not know whether or when a final plan of
    reorganization will become effective. Assuming that a final plan
    of reorganization (whether the PI Settlement Plan or another
    plan of reorganization) is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court,
    approved by the District Court, and does become effective, we do
    not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be
    consistent with the terms of the Settlement agreement or if the
    other conditions to our obligation to pay the Settlement
    agreement amount will be met. If these conditions are not
    satisfied or not waived by us, we will not be obligated to pay
    the amount contemplated by the Settlement agreement. However, if
    we do not pay the Settlement agreement amount, we will not be
    released from the various asbestos related, fraudulent transfer,
    successor liability, and indemnification claims made against us
    and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to
    be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on
    alternative settlement terms or trials. In that case, we could
    face liabilities that are significantly different from our
    obligations under the Settlement agreement. We cannot estimate
    at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be.
    In the event these liabilities are materially larger than the
    current existing obligations, they could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated financial position and results of
    operations.

Fresenius
    Claims

In January 2002, we filed a declaratory judgment action against
    Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG,
    a German company, and specified affiliates in New York State
    court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the
    parties. The Fresenius parties contended that we were obligated
    to indemnify them for liabilities that they might incur as a
    result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The
    Fresenius parties’ contention was based on their
    interpretation of the agreements between them and W. R.
    Grace & Co. — Conn. in connection with the
    1996 Fresenius transaction. In February 2002, the Fresenius
    parties announced that they had accrued a charge of
    $172.0 million for these potential liabilities, which
    included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs
    of defense of litigation arising from Grace’s
    Chapter 11 filing. We believe that we were not responsible
    to indemnify the Fresenius parties under the 1996 agreements and
    filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the Fresenius
    parties’ claims. In April 2002, the Fresenius parties filed
    a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory
    relief in its favor. We opposed the motion, and in July 2003,
    the court denied the motion without prejudice in view of the
    November 27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to above.
    As noted above, under the Settlement agreement, we and the
    Fresenius parties will exchange mutual releases, which will
    release us from any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius
    transaction.

Canadian
    Claims

In November 2004, the Company’s Canadian subsidiary Sealed
    Air (Canada) Co./Cie learned that it had been named a defendant
    in the case of

Thundersky v. The Attorney General of
    Canada, et al.

(File

No. CI04-01-39818),

pending in the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench. Grace and
    W. R. Grace & Co. — Conn. are also named as
    defendants. The plaintiff brought the claim as a putative class
    proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by
    any Canadian resident, other than in the course of employment,
    as a result of Grace’s marketing, selling, processing,
    manufacturing, distributing

and/or

delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada
    prior to the Cryovac Transaction. A plaintiff filed another
    proceeding in January 2005 in the Manitoba Court of The
    Queen’s Bench naming the Company and specified subsidiaries
    as defendants. The latter proceeding,

Her Majesty the Queen
    in Right of the Province of Manitoba v. The Attorney
    General of Canada, et al.

(File

No. CI05-01-41069),

seeks the recovery of the cost of insured health services
    allegedly provided by the Government of Manitoba to the members
    of the class of plaintiffs in the

Thundersky

proceeding.
    In October 2005, we learned that six additional putative class
    proceedings had been brought in various provincial and federal
    courts in Canada seeking recovery from the Company and its
    subsidiaries Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air (Canada) Co./Cie, as
    well as other defendants including W. R. Grace & Co.
    and W. R. Grace & Co. — Conn., for alleged
    injuries suffered by any Canadian resident, other than in the
    course of employment (except with respect to one of these six
    claims), as a result of Grace’s marketing, selling,
    manufacturing, processing, distributing

and/or

delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada
    prior to the Cryovac transaction. Grace and W. R.
    Grace & Co. — Conn. have agreed to defend,
    indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates in
    respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees and
    costs, in these actions.

In April 2001, Grace Canada, Inc. had obtained an order of the
    Superior Court of Justice, Commercial List, Toronto (the
    “Canadian Court”), recognizing the Chapter 11
    actions in the United States of America involving Grace Canada,
    Inc.’s U.S. parent corporation and other affiliates of
    Grace Canada, Inc., and enjoining all new actions and staying
    all current proceedings against Grace Canada, Inc. related to
    asbestos under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act.
    That order has been renewed repeatedly. In November 2005, upon
    motion by Grace Canada, Inc., the Canadian Court ordered an
    extension of the injunction and stay to actions involving
    asbestos against the Company and its Canadian affiliate and the
    Attorney General of Canada, which had the effect of staying all
    of the Canadian actions referred to above. The parties finalized
    a global settlement of these Canadian actions (except for claims
    against the Canadian government). That settlement, which has
    subsequently been amended (the “Canadian Settlement”),
    will be entirely funded by Grace. The Canadian Court issued an
    Order on December 13,

Commitments
    and Contingencies (Continued)

2009 approving the Canadian Settlement. We do not have any
    positive obligations under the Canadian Settlement, but we are a
    beneficiary of the release of claims. The release in favor of
    the Grace parties (including us) will become operative upon the
    effective date of a plan of reorganization in Grace’s
    United States Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. As filed,
    the PI Settlement Plan contemplates that the claims released
    under the Canadian Settlement will be subject to injunctions
    under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. By its terms,
    the Canadian Settlement will, unless amended, become null and
    void if a confirmation order in the Grace U.S. bankruptcy
    proceeding is not granted prior to July 31, 2011. As
    indicated above, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation
    Order on January 31, 2011 and the Clarifying Order on
    February 15, 2011; however, we can give no assurance that
    the PI Settlement Plan (or any other plan of reorganization)
    will be approved by the District Court or will become effective.
    Assuming that a final plan of reorganization (whether the PI
    Settlement Plan or another plan of reorganization) is confirmed
    by the Bankruptcy Court, approved by the District Court, and
    does become effective, if the final plan of reorganization does
    not incorporate the terms of the Canadian Settlement or if the
    Canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of
    reorganization in the Canadian courts, and if in addition Grace
    is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify the Company and
    its subsidiaries in these cases, then we could be required to
    pay substantial damages, which we cannot estimate at this time
    and which could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Additional
    Matters Related to the Cryovac Transaction

In view of Grace’s Chapter 11 filing, we may receive
    additional claims asserting that we are liable for obligations
    that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac transaction and
    for which we may be contingently liable. To date, we are not
    aware of any material claims having been asserted or threatened
    against us.

Final determinations and accountings under the Cryovac
    transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the
    transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace’s
    Chapter 11 filing in 2001. We have filed claims in the
    bankruptcy proceeding that reflect the costs and liabilities
    that we have incurred or may incur that Grace and its affiliates
    agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by Grace
    and its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements,
    other than payments to be made under the Settlement agreement.
    Grace has alleged that we are responsible for specified amounts
    under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Subject to the terms
    of the Settlement agreement, amounts for which we may be liable
    to Grace may be used to offset the liabilities of Grace and its
    affiliates to us. We intend to seek indemnification by Grace and
    its affiliates to the extent permissible under law, the
    Settlement agreement, and the Cryovac transaction agreements.
    Except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim,
    we expect that our claims will be as an unsecured creditor of
    Grace. Since portions of our claims against Grace and its
    affiliates are contingent or unliquidated, we cannot determine
    the amount of our claims, the extent to which these claims may
    be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or
    the amount of our recovery on these claims, if any, in the
    bankruptcy proceeding.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from
    environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for
    anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation
    efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable
    and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into
    account any discounting for the time value of money and are not
    reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not
    believe that it is reasonably possible that our liability in
    excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental
    matters will be material to our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations. Environmental liabilities are
    reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or
    remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated.

We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available
    information, including the progress of remedial investigations
    at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory
    authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and
    the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible
    parties. As some of these issues

    and Contingencies (Continued)

are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties)
    or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated,
    we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that
    these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial
    position or results of operations. We believe that we have
    adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental
    exposures.

Other
    Principal Contractual Obligations

At December 31, 2010, we had principal contractual
    obligations, which included agreements to purchase an estimated
    amount of goods, including raw materials, or services in the
    normal course of business, aggregating approximately
    $286 million. The estimated future cash outlays are as
    follows:

    leases, which may include purchase or renewal options. At
    December 31, 2010, estimated future minimum annual rental

On February 17, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on
    March 18, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of
    business on March 4, 2011. The estimated amount of this
    dividend payment is $21 million based on 159 million
    shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of
    January 31, 2011.

The dividend payments discussed above are recorded as reductions
    to cash and cash equivalents and retained earnings on our
    consolidated balance sheets. From time to time, we may consider
    other means of returning value to our stockholders based on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations. There
    is no guarantee that our Board of Directors will declare any
    further dividends.

    Contingent Stock Plan

At our annual meeting of stockholders held on May 20, 2005,
    the stockholders approved the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of
    Sealed Air Corporation. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan is our
    sole long-term equity compensation



SEALED
    AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

Note 17

Stockholders’
    Equity (Continued)

program for officers and employees. The 2005 Contingent Stock
    Plan provides for awards of equity-based compensation, including
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share
    units and cash awards measured by share price, to our executive
    officers and other key employees, as well as

U.S.-based

key consultants. During the three years ended December 31,
    2010, under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, we granted
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards, in
    addition to the SLO and PSU awards described below. An employee
    or consultant selected by the Organization Committee of our
    Board of Directors to receive an award may accept the award
    during the period specified by us, provided the
    participant’s relationship to us has not changed.

Awards made under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan are restricted
    as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three
    years after award, except for SLO and PSU awards, which are
    described below. In the event of termination of employment of a
    participant before lapse of the restriction, the awards under
    the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan are forfeited on the date of
    termination unless (i) the termination results from the
    participant’s death or permanent and total disability, or
    (ii) the Compensation Committee affirmatively determines
    not to seek forfeiture of the award in whole or in part. The
    forfeiture provision of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan expires
    upon vesting of the awards, except that these provisions of the
    2005 Contingent Stock Plan lapse sooner upon certain
    terminations of employment following a change in control.

Amended
    2005 Contingent Stock Plan

At our annual meeting of stockholders held on May 20, 2008,
    our stockholders approved the amended 2005 Contingent Stock Plan
    of Sealed Air Corporation. The amended 2005 Contingent Stock
    Plan provides for the issuance of an additional three million
    shares of common stock for awards under the 2005 Contingent
    Stock Plan and accommodates awards to be made under our
    executive compensation program adopted in the first half of 2008.

Under our executive compensation program, we have the ability to
    grant to our executive officers and a small number of other key
    executives (1) stock leverage opportunity awards, known as
    SLO awards, as part of our annual incentive plan and
    (2) annual performance share unit awards, known as PSU
    awards, as part of our long term incentive program. Other
    employees are eligible to receive awards of restricted stock,
    restricted stock units and cash awards as long term incentive
    compensation under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan. Our executive
    officers and other key executives may also receive awards of
    restricted stock or restricted stock units from time to time.

For both restricted stock awards and units, we record
    compensation expense in marketing, administrative and
    development expenses on the consolidated statement of operations
    with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital within
    stockholders’ equity based on the fair value of our common
    stock at the award grant date. For cash awards, we record a
    liability, which is reflected in other liabilities on the
    consolidated balance sheets, and record compensation expense
    based on the fair value of the award at the end of each
    reporting period. The amount of the liability for cash awards is
    re-measured at each reporting period based on the then current
    stock price and the effects of the stock price changes are
    recognized as compensation expense. At December 31, 2010,
    the liability related to cash awards was $1 million.

Directors
    Stock Plan

Non-cash compensation included on the consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ equity includes expense associated with
    shares issued to non-employee directors in the form of awards
    under our 2002 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which our
    stockholders approved at the 2002 annual meeting. The
    2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual grants of
    shares to non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares
    to eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual
    meeting, as all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees
    for non-employee directors. Shares previously granted under the
    plan were granted at a price equal to the par value of the
    shares; however, the plan was amended in December 2008 to
    eliminate the cash payment of the par value for future grants.
    During 2002, we adopted a plan that permits non-employee
    directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer
    until the non-employee director retires from the Board of
    Directors. The non-employee director can elect to defer the
    portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock. If a
    non-employee director makes this election, the non-employee
    director may also elect to defer the portion, if any, of the
    annual retainer payable in cash. Cash dividends on deferred
    shares are credited to the non-employee director’s deferred
    cash account on the applicable dividend payment date. We record
    the excess of fair value over the price at which shares are
    issued under this plan in marketing, administrative and
    development expenses on the consolidated statements of
    operations, and this expense was $0.5 million in 2010 and
    2009 and $0.4 million in 2008.

Other
    Common Stock Issuances

We have historically issued shares of our common stock under our
    2005 Contingent Stock Plan to selected

U.S.-based

consultants as compensation under consulting agreements for
    research and development projects. We record the cost associated
    with these issuances on a straight-line basis based on each of
    the issuances’ vesting schedule. Amortization expense
    related to these issuances was immaterial in each the three
    years ended December 31, 2010.

Total
    Share-based Incentive Compensation

We record share-based incentive compensation expense in
    marketing, administrative and development expenses on our
    consolidated statements of operations with a corresponding
    credit to additional paid-in capital within stockholders’
    equity based on the fair value of the share-based incentive
    compensation awards at the date of grant. Each quarter, we
    recognize an expense or credit reflecting the straight-line
    recognition, net of estimated forfeitures, of the expected cost
    of the program. For the 2010 three-year PSU awards and the 2009
    two-year and three-year PSU awards, to the extent the
    performance against the targets improves or worsens, the
    cumulative amount accrued to date is adjusted up or down.

Total share-based incentive compensation expense by program in
    the three years ended December 31, 2010 was as follows:

For the 2010 Three-year PSU awards and the 2009 Three-year PSU
    awards, the estimated amount of this future share-based
    incentive compensation expense will fluctuate based on:
    1) the level of achievement of the respective goals and
    measures considered probable in future quarters, which impacts
    the number of shares that could be issued; and 2) the
    future price of our common stock, which impacts the expense
    related to additional discretionary shares.

The discussion that follows provides further details of our
    share-based incentive compensation programs.

PSU
    Awards

As part of our long term incentive program adopted in 2008,
    during the first 90 days of each year starting in 2008, the
    Compensation Committee has approved Performance Share Unit (PSU)
    awards for our executive officers

    AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

and other selected key executives, which includes for each
    officer or executive a target number of shares of common stock
    and performance goals and measures that will determine the
    percentage of the target award that is earned following the end
    of the performance period. Following the end of the performance
    period, participants will also receive a cash payment in the
    amount of the dividends (without interest) that would have been
    paid during the performance period on the number of shares that
    they have earned. As of December 31, 2010, we have accrued
    $2.5 million for these dividends in other current
    liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

Executives who leave employment prior to the end of the
    performance period except due to death, disability or retirement
    will forfeit the PSU award. Executives who die, become disabled
    or retire during the performance period receive a prorata
    portion of the PSU award based on the portion of the performance
    period during which they were employed. Retirement for the
    purpose of the SLO awards described below and the PSU awards
    means termination of employment after five or more years of
    employment and with years of employment plus age equal to 70 or
    more, except termination for cause.

    Three-year PSU Awards

In March 2010, the Compensation Committee approved awards with a
    three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2010.
    The Compensation Committee established principal performance
    goals, which are 1) three-year cumulative volume growth of
    net trade sales and 2) three-year average return on
    invested capital. These performance goals are outlined in
    further detail in the Proxy Statement for our 2010 Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders. The targeted number of shares of common
    stock that can be earned is 433,481 shares for these 2010
    PSU awards. If the threshold level is achieved for either of the
    two performance goals mentioned above, then the number of shares
    earned for each participant can be increased (if the additional
    goal mentioned below is achieved) or decreased (if the
    additional goal mentioned below is not achieved) by up to 10% of
    the target level at the discretion of the Compensation
    Committee, or an aggregate of 43,348 shares for all
    participants. The additional goal is a 2012 safety result of a
    total recordable incident rate (a workplace safety indicator) of
    1.20 or better, excluding facilities acquired during the
    performance period.

The total number of shares to be issued for these awards can
    range from zero to 200% of the target number of shares depending
    on the level of achievement of the performance goals and
    measures, plus or minus the 43,348 additional discretionary
    shares mentioned above.

The expense included in the table above was calculated using a
    grant date common stock share price of $20.88 per share on
    March 8, 2010 and is based on management’s estimate as
    of December 31, 2010 of the level of probable achievement
    of the performance goals and measures, which was determined to
    be at the target level (433,481 shares, net of forfeitures)
    as of December 31, 2010.

    Two-year and Three-year PSU Awards

The targeted number of shares of common stock that can be earned
    is 574,518 shares for the two-year PSU awards and 569,679
    for the three-year PSU awards made in 2009. The total number of
    shares to be issued for each PSU for the two-year awards and the
    three-year awards can range from zero to 200% of the target
    number of shares depending on the level of achievement of the
    operating performance goals and measures. If the threshold level
    is achieved for the operating performance goals and measures,
    then the number of shares earned for each participant can be
    increased (if the additional goals mentioned below are achieved)
    or decreased (if the additional goals mentioned below are not
    achieved) by up to 10% of the target level at the discretion of
    the Compensation Committee, or an aggregate of
    114,420 shares for all participants for both awards. The
    additional goals are 1) average quarterly inventory days on
    hand starting December 31, 2008 through the performance
    period below the average quarterly days on hand for the period
    December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2008; and
    2) a safety result for the final year of the performance
    period of a total recordable incident rate of 1.30 or better,
    excluding facilities acquired during the performance period.
    These provisions are outlined in further detail in the 2010
    Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Probable
    achievement of the operating performance goals and measures

based on management’s estimate as of December 31, 2010
    was determined to be at the maximum level for both the two-year
    PSU awards (1,149,036 shares, net of forfeitures) and the
    three-year PSU awards (1,139,358 shares, net of
    forfeitures) as of December 31, 2010. The expense included
    in the table above for the shares related to the achievement of
    the operating performance goals and measures was calculated
    using a common stock share price of $20.88 per share on
    March 8, 2010. The expense included in the table above for
    the shares related to the additional goals was calculated using
    a common stock share price of $25.45 on December 31, 2010,
    because of their discretionary nature.

SLO
    Awards

Before the start of each performance year, each of our executive
    officers and other selected key executives is eligible to elect
    to receive all or a portion of his or her annual cash bonus for
    that year, in increments of 25% of the annual bonus, as an award
    of restricted stock or restricted stock units under the 2005
    Contingent Stock Plan in lieu of cash. The portion provided as
    an equity award may be given a premium to be determined by the
    Compensation Committee each year and will be rounded up to the
    nearest whole share. The stock price used in the calculation of
    the number of shares will be the closing sale price of our
    common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the first trading
    day of the performance year. The award will be granted following
    the end of the performance year and after determination by the
    Compensation Committee of the amount of the annual bonus award
    for each executive officer and other selected key executive who
    has elected to take all or a portion of his or her annual bonus
    as an equity award, but no later than the March 15 following the
    end of the performance year.

The equity award will be made in the form of an award of
    restricted stock or restricted stock units that will vest on the
    second anniversary of the grant date or earlier in the event of
    death, disability or retirement from employment with us, and the
    shares subject to the award will not be transferable by the
    recipient until the later of vesting or the second anniversary
    of the grant date. If the recipient ceases to be employed by us
    before vesting, then the shares will be forfeited, except for
    certain circumstances following a change in control. The award
    will be made in the form of restricted stock unless the award
    would be taxable to the recipient before the shares become
    transferable by the recipient, in which case the award will be
    made in the form of restricted stock units. Recipients who hold
    SLO awards in the form of restricted stock receive dividends.
    Recipients who hold SLO awards in the form of restricted stock
    units receive a cash payment in the amount of the dividends
    (without interest) on the shares they have earned at about the
    same time that shares are issued to them following the period of
    restriction. As of December 31, 2010, we have accrued for
    these dividends in other current liabilities on our consolidated
    balance sheet and the amount was immaterial.

For 2010, the Compensation Committee set the SLO award premium
    at 25%. The 2010 SLO target awards comprise an aggregate of
    93,589 restricted stock shares and restricted stock units. For
    2009, the Compensation Committee set the SLO award premium at
    25%. The 2009 SLO target awards comprise an aggregate of 152,687
    restricted stock shares and restricted stock units.

We record compensation expense for these awards in marketing,
    administrative and development expenses on the consolidated
    statement of operations with a corresponding credit to
    additional

paid-in-capital

within stockholder’s equity, based on the fair value of the
    awards at the end of each reporting period, which reflects the
    effects of stock price changes.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, compensation expense
    related to the 2010 SLO awards was recognized based on the
    extent to which the performance goals and measures for 2010
    annual cash bonuses were considered probable of achievement at
    December 31, 2010. This expense is being recognized over a
    fifteen month period on a straight-line basis since a majority
    of the awards will vest at grant date, which will be no later
    than March 15, 2011, due to the retirement eligibility
    provision.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, compensation expense
    related to the 2009 SLO awards was recognized based on the
    extent to which the performance goals and measures for 2009
    annual cash bonuses were considered probable of achievement at
    December 31, 2009. This expense was recognized over a
    fifteen month period on a

straight-line basis since a majority of the awards vested at
    grant date, which was March 15, 2010, due to the retirement
    eligibility provision.

Other
    Long-term Share-based Incentive Compensation

Under our executive compensation program, the Compensation
    Committee may grant our executive officers and a small number of
    other key executives and other employees awards of restricted
    stock, restricted stock units and cash awards as long-term
    share-based incentive compensation under our 2005 Contingent
    Stock Plan. Our executive officers and other key executives may
    also receive awards of restricted stock or restricted stock
    units from time to time.

Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding
    provides for the following items if their inclusion is dilutive:
    (1) the effect of assumed issuance of 18 million
    shares of common stock reserved for the Settlement agreement in
    the three years ended December 31, 2010, (2) the
    effect of non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units
    using the treasury stock method in the three years ended
    December 31, 2010 and (3) the effect of conversion of
    our then-outstanding 3% Convertible Senior Notes due June
    2033 in July 2009 in 2009 and 2008.

PSU
    Awards

Since the PSU awards discussed in Note 17,
    “Stockholders’ Equity,” are contingently issuable
    shares that are based on operating performance goals and
    measures, a weighted average of approximately 0.3 million
    shares of the PSU awards were included in the diluted weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding calculation for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 as the threshold for some of
    the goals and measures was met as of December 31, 2010. All
    other remaining shares related to the PSU awards were excluded
    from the diluted weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding for calculation of diluted net earnings per common
    share for the year ended December 31, 2010 because they
    have not met their respective performance conditions as of
    December 31, 2010.

SLO
    Awards

The shares or units associated with the SLO awards for the
    fiscal year 2010 are considered contingent shares and therefore
    are not included in the basic or diluted weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. These shares or units, discussed in
    Note 17, “Stockholders’ Equity,” will not be
    included in the common shares outstanding until the final
    determination of the amount of annual incentive compensation is
    made in the first quarter of the following year consistent with
    the treatment of these awards in 2009 and 2008. Once this
    determination is made, the shares or units will be included in
    basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding if
    the employee is retirement eligible or in the diluted weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding if the employee is
    not retirement eligible. The number of shares included in the
    common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31,
    2010 for the 2009 and 2008 awards was nominal.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in

Rule 13a-15

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
    our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that our
    employees accumulate this information and communicate it to our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal
    executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our
    principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure. In designing and
    evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our
    management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
    matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
    “reasonable assurance” of achieving the desired
    control objectives, and management necessarily must apply its
    judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
    controls and procedures.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried
    out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under

Rule 13a-15.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, supervised and participated in this
    evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    “reasonable assurance” level.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term
    is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Management evaluated, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, the effectiveness, as of the end of our 2010 fiscal
    year, of our internal control over financial reporting. The
    suitable recognized control framework on which management’s
    evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting is
    based is the Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission, known as COSO. Based upon that evaluation
    under the COSO framework, our management concluded that our
    internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our
    2010 fiscal year was effective at the “reasonable
    assurance” level.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over
    financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,
    2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
