PART I

Item 1.

Business

Sealed Air Corporation (the “Company”), operating
through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and
protective packaging products.

The Company conducts
substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US). These two
subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the
business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the
globe. References herein to the Company include, collectively, the Company and
its subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise.

Segments

The Company operates in
two reportable business segments: (i) Food Packaging and (ii) Protective
Packaging, described more fully below. Information concerning the Company’s
reportable segments, including net sales, operating profit and assets, appears
in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is
incorporated herein by reference.

Food Packaging Products

The Company’s principal
food packaging products are flexible materials, associated packaging equipment
systems, rigid containers and absorbent pads. These products package a broad
range of perishable foods and are marketed globally. The Company primarily
sells the products in this segment to food processors, distributors,
supermarket retailers and food service businesses.

Flexible Materials
and Related Systems

The Company produces a variety of high-performance
proprietary flexible vacuum shrink products, including shrink bags and shrink
films, as well as non-shrink structures and associated packaging equipment
systems, marketed and sold primarily under the Cryovac® trademark. Customers use
these products to package a broad range of perishable foods such as fresh meat
and poultry, smoked and processed meat, cheese, produce, seafood, baked goods,
and processed and prepared foods such as soups, stews, condiments and sauces
for restaurants and institutions.

The Company’s principal food packaging materials
offerings are shrink bags, shrink films and non-shrink structures. The bags and
films are co-extruded, multi-layered materials that, when exposed to
heat, mold themselves to the shape of the product. The non-shrink structures
are multi-layered plastic materials used to package perishable foods and
shelf-stable products such as syrups and toppings. The Company’s flexible
materials start with a co-extruded film produced by combining two or more resins
into a multi-layered film. Some of these films are subsequently laminated
to other films to provide additional properties. The Company generally produces
films and bags in barrier and permeable forms, depending on the extent to which
customers want oxygen or other gases to pass through the material. For
fresh-cut produce, the Company produces films that permit gases to pass through
at various rates, matching the varying respiration rates of different
vegetables, thereby extending shelf life. For the heat-and-serve category, the
Company offers its Simple Steps™ package, which is an easy-open microwavable
package designed with Cryovac® vacuum skin packaging technology and a unique
self-venting feature. The Company’s Darfresh® product offerings provide vacuum
skin packaging for a variety of foods. The Company also offers films, tubing
and connectors for use in manufacturing bags and pouches for a wide variety of
medical applications. Additionally, the Company thermoforms packaging materials
for medical and technical products. Many of the Company’s offerings in the
medical field are manufactured using


technology comparable to
that used to manufacture the Company’s food packaging products and are similar
in form to those products.

The Company’s principal
food packaging equipment offerings are rotary chamber vacuum systems, vertical
form-fill-seal pouch packaging systems, dispensing equipment, manual and
automated loading units, shrink tunnels, bagging systems and auxiliary
equipment. Equipment offerings may be installed to package foods in shrink,
vacuum or vacuum skin packages, which can utilize the Company’s films and bags.
The vertical pouch-packaging units may be used to package hot-fill or
cold-fill pumpable foods using the Company’s non-shrink structures. The Company’s
case ready packaging customers, principally meat and poultry processors,
purchase trays and pads as discussed below, specially designed films, and
packaging equipment to package consumer cuts of meat and poultry products at a
central location prior to shipment to the supermarket. Case ready packages are
ready for the meat case upon arrival at the retail store.

Rigid Packaging and
Absorbent Pads

The Company sells foam and
solid plastic trays and containers that customers use to package a wide variety
of food products. The Company manufactures such products in its own facilities
in various regions or has them fabricated by other manufacturers. Food
processors and supermarkets use these products to protect and display fresh
meat, poultry, dairy, produce and other food products. The Company also
manufactures and sells absorbent pads used for food packaging, such as its
Dri-Loc® absorbent pads.

Protective Packaging Products

The Company’s principal
protective packaging products provide cushioning, surface protection and void
fill. The Company sells its protective packaging products and systems to
distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The products in
this segment enable end users to provide a high degree of protection in packaging
their items. They also aid product display and merchandising.

Cushioning and
Surface Protection Products

The Company manufactures and markets Bubble Wrap® and
AirCap® air cellular packaging materials, which consist of air encapsulated
between two layers of plastic film, each containing a barrier layer to retard
air loss. This material forms a pneumatic cushion to protect products from
damage through shock or vibration during shipment. Also, the Company sells
performance shrink films under the Cryovac®, Opti® and CorTuff® trademarks for
product display and merchandising applications. Customers use these films to “shrink-wrap”
a wide assortment of industrial and consumer products. The Company offers
Shanklin® and Opti® shrink packaging systems for these applications. The
Company’s Instapak® polyurethane foam packaging systems (which consist of
proprietary blends of polyurethane chemicals, high performance polyolefin films
and specially designed dispensing equipment) provide protective packaging for a
wide variety of products. These products include the Instapak® Continuous Foam
Tube packaging system. The Company generally sells CelluPlank® plank foams and
Stratocell® laminated polyethylene foams to fabricators and converters for
packaging and non-packaging applications. The Company also manufactures thin
polyethylene foams in roll and sheet form under the trademarks Cell-Aire® and
Cellu-Cushion®. Korrvu® packaging is the Company’s suspension and
retention packaging offering. In addition, the Company makes insulation
products with foil-laminated air cellular materials.

The Company manufactures and markets Jiffy® protective
mailers and other durable mailers and bags in several standard sizes. The
Company’s principal protective mailers are lightweight, tear-resistant mailers
marketed under various trademarks, including Jiffylite®, Mail Lite® and
TuffGard®, lined with air cellular cushioning material, as well as the widely
used Jiffy® padded mailers made from recycled kraft paper padded with macerated
recycled newspaper. The Company’s durable mailers and bags, composed of multi-layered
polyolefin film, are lightweight, water-resistant and puncture-resistant
and are available in


tamper-evident
varieties. The Company markets these mailers and bags under the ShurTuff®,
Trigon®, Lab Pak®, and Keepsafe® trademarks and other brands. The Company also
manufactures and sells paper packaging products under the trademarks Kushion
Kraft®, Custom Wrap™, Jiffy Packaging™ and Void Kraft™.

The Company also offers
inflatable packaging systems. Its Fill-Air® inflatable packaging system
converts rolls of polyethylene film into continuous perforated chains of
air-filled cushions. The Company’s Fill-Air® RF system consists of a compact,
portable inflator and self-sealing inflatable plastic bags. In addition, its
NEWAIR I.B.™ 200 and high speed 600 packaging systems provide on-site,
on-demand Barrier Bubble® cushioning material. The Company also markets its
PriorityPak™ system, a high-speed product containment and protective packaging
solution with advance sensor technology, to mail-order and Internet fulfillment
applications. The Company produces and markets converting systems that convert
some of the Company’s packaging materials, such as air cellular cushioning
materials, thin polyethylene foam and paper into sheets of a pre-selected size
and quantity, or in the case of the Company’s recycled kraft paper, into paper
dunnage material. Recently the Company introduced its FillTeck™ line of
equipment and materials and markets this product for applications requiring
on-site production of high performance air-filled quilted cushioning material.

Other Products

The Company manufactures
and sells a number of other products, such as specialty adhesive tapes, solar
collectors and covers for swimming pools, and products related to the
elimination and neutralization of static electricity. The Company also
manufactures loose-fill polystyrene packaging.

Foreign Operations

The Company operates in
the United States and in 50 other countries, and its products are distributed
in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. In maintaining its foreign
operations, the Company faces risks inherent in these operations, such as those
of currency fluctuations. Information on currency exchange risk appears in Part II,
Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is
incorporated herein by reference. Financial information about geographic areas
setting forth net sales and total long-lived assets for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2006 appears in Note 3 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein
by reference. The Company maintains programs to comply with the various laws, rules and
regulations that it may be subject to in the many countries in which it operates.
See “Environmental Matters,” below.

Marketing, Distribution and Customers

The Company’s global sales and marketing staff numbers
approximately 2,500 employees, who sell and market the Company’s products to
and through a large number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well
as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and
manufacturers.

To support its food packaging customers, the Company
operates food science laboratories that assist customers in identifying the
appropriate food packaging materials and systems to meet their needs. The
Company also offers customized graphic design services to its customers.

To assist its marketing efforts for its protective
packaging products and to provide specialized customer services, the Company
operates packaging laboratories in many of its facilities. These laboratories
are staffed by professional packaging engineers and equipped with drop-testing
and other equipment used to develop and test cost-effective package designs to
meet the particular protective packaging requirements of each customer.


The Company has no material long-term contracts for
the distribution of its products. In 2006, no customer or affiliated group of
customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Although net sales of both
food packaging products and protective packaging products tend to be slightly
higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be
material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment.

Competition

Competition for most of the Company’s packaging
products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service
and price. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology,
the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to
maintain technological leadership. There are other companies producing
competing products that are well established.

There are other manufacturers of food packaging
products, some of which are companies offering similar products that operate on
a global basis and others that operate in a region or single country. Competing
manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic, paper,
metals and other materials. In rigid packaging, the Company is generally one of
many suppliers in the geographic areas in which it operates. The Company
believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of (i) flexible food
packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in
which it offers those products, (ii) solid plastic trays for case ready
meat products in the United States, and (iii) absorbent pads for food
products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the United
States.

The Company’s protective
packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers
and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide
protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage. Among
the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products,
expanded plastics, corrugated die cuts, loose fill packaging materials,
strapping, envelopes, reinforced bags, boxes and other containers, and various
corrugated materials. The Company’s Instapak® packaging and its plank and
laminated foam products also compete with various types of molded foam
plastics, fabricated foam plastics, mechanical shock mounts, and wood blocking
and bracing systems. The Company believes that it is one of the leading
suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer,
inflatable packaging, shrink films for industrial and commercial applications,
protective mailers, polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems
in the principal geographic areas in which it sells these products.

Raw Materials

The principal raw materials used in both of the
Company’s reportable business segments are polyolefin and other petrochemical-based
resins and films, and paper and wood pulp products. The Company also purchases
corrugated materials, cores for rolls of products such as films and Bubble
Wrap® cushioning, inks for printed materials, and blowing agents used in the
expansion of foam packaging products. In addition, the Company offers a wide
variety of specialized packaging equipment, some of which it manufactures or
has manufactured to its specifications, some of which it assembles and some of
which it purchases from other suppliers.

The raw materials for the Company’s products generally
have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available
from several suppliers.

Natural disasters
such as hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities,
may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and
natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future. These factors could lead
to increased prices for the Company’s raw materials, curtailment of supplies
and allocation of raw materials by the Company’s suppliers.

Some
materials used in the Company’s protective packaging products are sourced


from materials recycled in
the Company’s manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in
recycling programs.

Research and Development Activities

The Company maintains a
continuing effort to develop new products and to improve its existing products
and processes, including developing new packaging and non-packaging applications
for its products. From time to time, the Company also acquires and
commercializes new packaging designs or techniques developed by others. The
Company has joint research and development projects combining the technical
capabilities of its food packaging operations and its protective packaging
operations. The Company spent $78.2 million for Company-sponsored
research and development in 2006, compared with $75.8 million during 2005, and
$73.2 million during 2004.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company is the owner
or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents, patent
applications, trademarks and trademark registrations that relate to many of its
products, manufacturing processes and equipment. The Company believes that its
patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. Neither of
the Company’s reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or
trademark alone. Rather, the Company believes that its success depends
primarily on its marketing, engineering and manufacturing skills and on its
ongoing research and development efforts. The Company believes that the
expiration or unenforceability of any of its patents, applications, licenses or
trademark registrations would not be material to the Company’s business or financial
position.

Environmental Matters

As a manufacturer, the Company is subject to various
laws, rules and regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities
in which it operates covering the release of materials into the environment,
regarding standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and
hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. In
2006, the European Parliament approved a major expansion of the European Union’s
chemical regulations. The legislation is known as REACH or Registration,
Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals. REACH, which becomes effective in June 2007,
is expected to have a widespread impact on industries and products worldwide
through trade in and with the European Union. The Company is working with its suppliers
to manage the impact of REACH on its operations and to insure compliance with
its provisions. The Company reviews environmental laws and regulations
pertaining to its operations and believes that compliance with current environmental
laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Company’s capital
expenditures or financial position.

In some jurisdictions in which the Company’s packaging
products are sold or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed
that seek to regulate, among other things, recycled or reprocessed content and
sale or disposal of packaging materials. In addition, customer demand continues
to evolve for packaging materials that are viewed as being “environmentally
sound” or that minimize the generation of solid waste. The Company maintains
programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations, to monitor their
evolution, and to meet this customer demand. These issues can be a competitive
advantage for the Company given the inherent source reduction benefits of many
of its processes and products. One advantage inherent in many of the Company’s
products is that thin, lightweight packaging solutions reduce customer waste
and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives. The Company
continues to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they
become available.

The Company also supports
its customers’ interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in
collection programs for some of the Company’s products or product packaging and
for materials used in some of the Company’s products. When possible, materials
collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in the
Company’s protective packaging operations or offered to other


manufacturers
for use in other products. In addition, recent gains made in internal recycling
programs have allowed the Company to improve its net raw material yield, thus
mitigating the impact of rising resin costs, while lowering solid waste
disposal costs.

Employees

As of December 31,
2006, the Company had approximately 17,400 employees worldwide. Approximately 7,300
of those employees were in the U.S., with approximately 600 of those covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 10,100 Company employees
who were outside the U.S., approximately 6,000 were covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Outside of the U.S., many of the covered employees are
represented by works councils or industrial boards, as is customary in the
jurisdictions in which they are employed. The Company believes that its
employee relations are satisfactory.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

Introduction

Investors should carefully consider the risks
described below before making an investment decision. These are the most
significant factors that make investing in the Company risky; however, they are
not the only factors that should be considered in making an investment
decision.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K also
contains and may incorporate by reference from the Company’s Proxy Statement
for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or from exhibits, forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below. The Company’s actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of many factors, including the risks faced by the
Company described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
or in documents incorporated by reference in this report.

The Company’s business,
financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely
affected by any of these risks. The trading price of the Company’s securities
could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in the Company’s
securities may lose all or part of their investment.

Asbestos Litigation and Related Litigation

If the settlement
of the asbestos claims that the Company has agreed to is not implemented, the
Company will not be released from the various asbestos-related,
fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and indemnification claims made
against it arising from a 1998 transaction with W. R. Grace & Co.
Further, the Company is a defendant in a lawsuit seeking class action status
concerning the Company’s public disclosures regarding these asbestos-related
claims. The Company is also a defendant in a number of asbestos-related
actions in Canada arising from Grace’s activities in Canada prior to 1998.

On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an
agreement in principle with the Official Committee of Asbestos Personal Injury
Claimants and the Official Committee of Asbestos Property Damage Claimants
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the W. R. Grace & Co.
bankruptcy case to resolve


all current and future
asbestos-related claims made against the Company and its affiliates. The
settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims and successor
liability claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care
Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies in connection with the Cryovac
transaction. The Cryovac transaction was a multi-step transaction, completed on
March 31, 1998, which brought the Cryovac packaging business and the
former Sealed Air Corporation’s business under the common ownership of the
Company. The parties to the agreement in principle signed a definitive
settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent with the terms of
the agreement in principle. On June 27, 2005, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware, where the Grace bankruptcy case is pending,
signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement. Although Grace
is not a party to the settlement agreement, under the terms of the order, Grace
is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited
exceptions. If the settlement agreement does not become effective, either
because Grace fails to emerge from bankruptcy or because Grace does not emerge
from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms
of the settlement agreement, then the Company will not be released from the
various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and
indemnification claims made against the Company and its affiliates noted above,
and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved
through other means, such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms
or trials. In that case, the Company could face liabilities that are
significantly different from its obligations under the settlement agreement.
The Company cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their
magnitude may be. In the event these liabilities are materially larger than the
current existing obligations, they could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Although Grace filed a
proposed plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy Court in January 2005,
the Company cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become
effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the
settlement agreement.

The Company is a defendant in the case of

Senn v. Hickey, et al.

(Case No. 03-CV-4372)
in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (Newark). This
lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of all persons who purchased or
otherwise acquired securities of the Company during the period from March 27,
2000 through July 30, 2002. The lawsuit names the Company and five current
and former officers and directors of the Company as defendants. One of these
individuals and the Company remain as defendants after a partial grant of the
defendants’ motion to dismiss the action. The plaintiff’s principal allegations
against the defendants are that during the above period the defendants
materially misled the investing public, artificially inflated the price of the
Company’s common stock by publicly issuing false and misleading statements and
violated U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, by failing to
properly account and accrue for the Company’s contingent liability for asbestos
claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory
damages and other relief. If the Court determines that the Company is liable in
this case, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, which the
Company cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. On October 3,
2006, plaintiff filed a motion to certify a class of all persons who purchased
or otherwise acquired the securities of the Company during the period from March 27,
2000 through July 30, 2002. On November 22,
2006, plaintiff filed an amended motion for class certification, seeking to
withdraw as a class representative and the substitution of a new class
representative, the State of Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System. Discovery concerning class certification and the merits is ongoing.

Since November 2004, the Company and specified
subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases, including a
number of putative class actions, brought in Canada as a result of Grace’s
alleged marketing, manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos-containing
products in Canada prior to the Cryovac Transaction. Grace has agreed to defend
and indemnify the Company and its subsidiaries in these cases. The Canadian
cases are currently stayed, and Grace’s proposed plan of reorganization
provides for payment of these claims and enforcement of the plan of
reorganization in the Canadian courts. However, if Grace’s final plan does not
make the same provisions or if the Canadian courts refuse to enforce Grace’s
final plan in the Canadian courts, and if in addition Grace is unwilling or


unable to defend and
indemnify the Company and its subsidiaries in these cases, then the Company
could be required to pay substantial damages, which the Company cannot estimate
at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations.

For further information
concerning these matters, see Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item
8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under
“Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs,” “Cryovac Transaction,” and
“Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction.”

Raw Materials and Energy

Raw material
pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as other energy-related
costs may negatively impact the Company’s results of operations, including its
profit margins.

The Company uses petrochemical-based
raw materials to manufacture many of its food and protective packaging
products. During most of 2006 petrochemical-based raw material and other
energy-related costs increased, with oil futures setting a record high.
This negatively impacted the Company’s profit margins. Continued increases in
market demand for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy could increase
costs for the Company. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as
political instability and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the
production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and
petrochemical suppliers in the future. These factors could lead to increased
prices for the Company’s raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation
of raw materials by the Company’s suppliers, which could reduce revenues and
profit margins and harm relations with the Company’s customers and which could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results
of operations.

Animal and Food-Related Health Issues

The effects of
animal and food-related health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
also known as “mad cow” disease, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza or
“bird-flu,” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry, may
lead to decreased revenues for the Company.

The Company manufactures
and sells food packaging products, among other products. Various health issues
affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a
negative effect on the sales of food packaging products. During 2006,
additional cases of mad cow disease were confirmed and incidents of bird flu
have continued to surface in various countries. Outbreaks of animal diseases
such as mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease, for example, may lead governments to
restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products,
leading to decreased demand for the Company’s products and possibly also to the
culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise
intended for food supply. Also, consumers may change their eating habits as a
result of perceived problems with certain types of food. These restrictions and
changes may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products by the Company,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations.

Global Operations

The global nature
of the Company’s operations in the United States and in fifty foreign countries
exposes it to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect its
financial condition and results of operations.


The Company operates in the United States and in 50
other countries, and its products are distributed in those countries as well as
in other parts of the world. The Company continues to expand its global
presence as net sales outside the United States in 2006 made up approximately
52% of the Company’s total net sales. Additionally the Company has 73
manufacturing facilities and approximately 10,100 employees located outside the
United States.

As a result of its global operations, the Company is
exposed to economic, political, business and market conditions in the
geographic areas in which it conducts business. Changes in domestic or foreign
laws, rules or regulations (such as the REACH legislation discussed above
in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under
“Environmental Matters”), or governmental or agency actions can negatively
affect the Company’s ability to carry on its business. Governments may impose
restrictive or protective import/export requirements as well as other trade
measures that may have a negative impact on the Company. Some of the countries
in which the Company’s subsidiaries operate have significantly different laws
on the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights. As a global
entity, the Company may also have greater exposure to the acts and effects of
war or terrorism.

The Company is exposed to
market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company
may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, which use exposes the Company to counterparty
credit risk for nonperformance. Additionally, some of the Company’s
subsidiaries may operate in countries that have highly inflationary economies.

Global Manufacturing Strategy

The Company has
begun the first phase of a new global manufacturing strategy. The costs of the
global manufacturing strategy could exceed the benefits if market forces or
other factors negatively impact the execution and fulfillment of the strategy.

The Company has begun the
first phase of a new global manufacturing strategy. This strategy includes an
expansion of the Company’s global production capabilities in developing markets
around the world, as well as a realignment of its existing production into
manufacturing centers of excellence. The goal of this multi-year program is to
expand capacity in growing markets in developing countries, further improve the
Company’s operating efficiencies, lower its overall cost structure and
implement new technologies more effectively. There are risks inherent in the
undertaking of such a program, including the stability and sustainability of
developing markets, shifts in customer preferences, competitive forces and technologies,
cost overruns and unanticipated consequences, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of
operations.

Reliance on Subsidiaries

The Company’s
subsidiaries hold substantially all of its assets and liabilities and conduct
substantially all of its operations, and as a result the Company relies on
distributions or advances from its subsidiaries.

The Company conducts
substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US). These two
subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the
Company’s business and conduct operations themselves and through other
subsidiaries around the globe. Therefore, the Company depends on distributions
or advances from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other
obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of its common stock.
Contractual provisions, laws or regulations to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries may become subject, as well its subsidiaries’ financial condition
and operating requirements, may reduce funds available for service of its
indebtedness, dividends, and general corporate purposes.


Volatility of Stock Price, Volume Sales and Large
Holdings

The price of the
Company’s common stock historically has experienced significant price and
volume fluctuations, which may make it difficult for investors to resell the
common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of the Company’s common stock
could adversely affect the price of the common stock. One shareholder has been
identified as having sole voting and dispositive power with respect to
28,916,696 shares, or approximately 35.9%, of the Company’s common stock, and
another shareholder has been identified as having sole dispositive power with
respect to 12,710,000 shares, or approximately 15.8%, of the Company’s common
stock.

The market price of the Company’s common stock
historically has experienced and may continue to experience significant price
and volume fluctuations similar to those experienced by the broader stock
market in recent years. In addition, the Company’s announcements of its
quarterly operating results, future developments relating to the W. R. Grace
bankruptcy, additional asbestos or other litigation against the Company, the
effects of animal and food-related health issues, spikes in raw material and
energy-related costs, changes in general conditions in the economy or the
financial markets and other developments affecting the Company, its affiliates
or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to
fluctuate substantially.

The sale of substantial amounts of the Company’s
common stock could adversely affect its price. According to a Schedule 13G/A
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, dated as of December 31,
2006, Davis Selected Advisers, L.P. reported sole voting and dispositive power
with respect to 28,916,696 shares, or approximately 35.9%, of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock, and according to a Schedule 13G/A
filed with the SEC, dated as of February 7, 2007, Capital Research and
Management Company reported sole dispositive power with respect to 12,710,000
shares, or approximately 15.8%, of the Company’s outstanding common stock. In
addition, as of December 31, 2006, 2,072,874 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance under the Company’s contingent stock plan and directors’
stock plan. Issuance of such reserved shares would cause dilution of stock
holdings. Moreover, as of December 31, 2006, nine million shares of the
Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the settlement of
the asbestos litigation upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in
the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace. The sale or the availability for sale of a large
number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the public market could
adversely affect the price of the common stock.

While the Schedules 13G/A
filed by Davis Selected Advisers and Capital Research and Management indicate
that the referenced shares of the Company’s common stock were not acquired for
the purpose of changing or influencing the control of the Company, if either
stockholder were to change its purpose of holding the Company’s common stock
from investment to attempting to influence the management of the Company, these
concentrations of the Company’s common stock could potentially negatively
impact the Company and the price of its common stock.

Properties

The Company produces products in 120 manufacturing
facilities, with 22 of those facilities serving both its food packaging and
protective packaging business segments. The Company produces food packaging
products in 51 manufacturing facilities, of which 15 were in North America, 12
in the European region, 9 in Latin America, 13 in the Asia Pacific region, and
2 in Africa. The Company produces protective packaging products in 91 manufacturing
facilities, of which 42 were in North America, 26 in the European region, 9 in
Latin America, 12 in the Asia Pacific region, and 2 in Africa. The Company
occupies


other facilities
containing sales, distribution, technical, warehouse or administrative functions
at a number of locations in the United States and in various foreign countries.

In the United States, the Company manufactures food
packaging products at facilities in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi,
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas. It
manufactures protective packaging products at facilities in California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Texas and Washington. Because of the relatively low density of the Company’s
air cellular, polyethylene foam and protective mailer products, the Company
realizes significant freight savings by locating manufacturing facilities for
these products near its customers and distributors.

The Company owns the large
majority of its manufacturing facilities. Some of these facilities are subject
to secured or other financing arrangements. The Company also leases sites for
warehouse and office needs, as well as for the balance of its manufacturing
facilities, which are generally smaller sites. The Company’s manufacturing
facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house the
Company’s specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products.
The Company believes that its manufacturing, warehouse and office facilities
are well maintained, suitable for their purposes and adequate for the Company’s
needs.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 16 under the captions “Cryovac
Transaction,” “Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction” and “Compliance
Matters” is incorporated herein by reference.

At December 31, 2006, the Company was a party to,
or otherwise involved in, several federal, state and foreign environmental
proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “Superfund”
sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980 and other sites. The Company may have potential liability
for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites. It is the Company’s
policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and if the Company can reasonably estimate an
amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation
strategies, without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds. As
assessments and cleanups proceed, the Company reviews these liabilities
periodically and adjusts its reserves as additional information becomes
available. At December 31, 2006, environmental related reserves were not
material to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. While
it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact
of environmental matters, based upon the information currently available to the
Company and its experience in dealing with these matters, the Company believes
that its potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material
to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Company is also
involved in various other legal actions incidental to its business. The Company
believes, after consulting with counsel, that the disposition of these other
legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations.

As of January 31,

Stock.

Dividends

There are no restrictions that currently materially
limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or that the Company reasonably
believes are likely to limit materially the future payment of dividends on the
common stock. On January 30, 2006, the Company announced that it was
initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend. The Company used cash of $48.6
million during 2006 to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share on
March 17, June 16, September 15, and December 15, 2006.
Previously, the Company had not paid cash dividends on its Common Stock during
the periods presented.

On February 16, 2007, the Company announced that
its Board of Directors had declared a two-for-one stock split to be effected in
the form of a stock dividend payable on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of
record of outstanding shares of its common stock at the close of business on
March 2, 2007. The Company’s Board of Directors also increased the Company’s
quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common share, declaring a quarterly
cash dividend payable on the pre-split shares of the Company’s common stock on
March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on
March 2, 2007. The Company currently expects that comparable cash
dividends will continue to be paid in future quarters. From time to time, the
Company will consider other means of returning value to its stockholders based
on its financial condition and results of operations. There is no guarantee
that the Company’s Board of Directors will declare any further dividends.


Common Stock Performance Comparisons

The following graph shows, for the five years ended
December 31, 2006, the cumulative total return on an investment of $100
assumed to have been made on December 31, 2001 in the Company’s common
stock. The graph compares this return (“SAC”) with that of comparable investments
assumed to have been made on the same date in (a) the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Stock Index (“Composite S&P 500”), and (b) the containers
and packaging segment of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index
(“Containers & Packaging”), the published Standard & Poor’s
market segment for the Company.

Total return for
each assumed investment assumes the reinvestment of all dividends on
December 31 of the year in which the dividends were paid.

On June 29, 1998,
the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the purchase
of up to five percent of the Company’s then issued and outstanding capital
stock on an as-converted basis. On April 14, 2000, the Company announced
that its Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional
five percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding capital stock as of June 30,
2000 on an as-converted basis. On November 3, 2000, the Company announced that
its Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional five
percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding capital stock as of October 31,
2000 on an as-converted basis. At the time of these authorizations, the Company’s
capital stock comprised its common stock and its Series A


convertible
preferred stock. Prior to its redemption in July 2003, each share of the
Company’s Series A convertible preferred stock was convertible into 0.885
shares of the Company’s common stock. These authorizations compose a single
program, which has no set expiration date. As of the close of business on December 31,
2006, 16,977,147 shares of the Company’s common stock were authorized to be
repurchased under this program, 15,376,571 shares had been repurchased
(including preferred shares on an as-converted basis), leaving 1,600,576 shares
of common stock authorized for repurchase under the program.

In
November 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the
appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related
claims made against it and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac
transaction. In connection with this settlement, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $850.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations in

EBIT is defined as
earnings (loss) before interest expense and provisions for income taxes. EBITDA
is defined as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. EBIT and EBITDA do not
purport to represent net earnings or net cash provided by operating activities
as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles and
should not be considered as an alternative to such measurements or as
indicators of the Company’s performance. The Company’s definitions of EBIT and
EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other
companies. EBIT and EBITDA are among the indicators used by the Company’s
management to measure the performance of the Company’s operations and thus the
Company’s management believes such information may be useful to investors. Such
measures are also among the criteria upon which performance-based
compensation may be based. The following is a reconciliation of net earnings
(loss) to EBIT and EBITDA:

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The information in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” should be read together with the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due
to rounding.

Introduction

The Company manufactures and sells a wide range of
food and protective packaging products, operating in the United States and in 50
other countries, with products distributed in those countries and in other
parts of the world.

The Company operates in two reportable business
segments, Food Packaging and Protective Packaging. The Company’s principal food
packaging products are flexible materials, associated packaging equipment
systems, rigid containers and absorbent pads. These products, many of which
bear the Cryovac trademark, package a broad range of perishable foods. The
Company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors,
distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses.

The Company’s principal protective packaging products
provide cushioning, surface protection and void fill. The Company primarily
sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and
manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The products in this segment
enable end users to provide a high degree of protection in packaging their
items. They also aid product display and merchandising.

The Company’s global sales and marketing staff
numbered approximately 2,500 employees in the countries in which it operates,
who sell and market the Company’s products through a large number of
distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such
as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers. The Company has
no material long-term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2006,
no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the
Company’s consolidated net sales. Although net sales of both food packaging
products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in
the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to
its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment.

Competition for most of the Company’s packaging
products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service
and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology
and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development
programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership.

The Company’s net sales are sensitive to developments
in its customers’ business or market conditions, changes in the global economy,
and the effects of foreign currency translation. Its costs can vary with
changes in petrochemical-related costs, which are not within the Company’s
control. Consequently, the Company’s management focuses on reducing those costs
that the Company can control and using petrochemical-based raw materials
as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence
helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may
more strongly affect some of its competitors.

As is discussed below, the Company’s businesses are
managed to generate substantial cash flow. The Company believes that its strong
cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and
development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital
expenditures for property and equipment. Moreover, its ability to generate
substantial cash flow should provide the Company with the flexibility to modify
its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. This cash flow, along
with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities, should
enable the Company to make the


settlement payment,
including interest, that is expected to be required of the Company upon
consummation of a plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co.
bankruptcy, as discussed below.

In addition to investing in its business, the Company
uses its cash flow to reduce debt and to return value to its shareholders. On January 30,
2006, the Company announced that it was initiating payment of a quarterly cash
dividend. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per
common share that was payable on March 17, June 16, September 15,
and December 15, 2006. On February 16, 2007, the Company announced
that its Board of Directors had declared a two-for-one stock split to be
effected in the form of a stock dividend payable on March 16, 2007 to
stockholders of record of outstanding shares of its common stock at the close
of business on March 2, 2007. The Company’s Board of Directors also
increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common
share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the pre-split shares of
the Company’s common stock on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record at
the close of business on March 2, 2007. In addition

,

on
July 19, 2006, the Company’s 5.625% euro notes with a face value of

€

200.0 million
matured. The Company used available cash of $251.7 million to retire this debt.

Net Sales

The principal factors contributing to changes in net
sales in the three years ended December 31, 2006 were changes in unit
volume, changes in product mix and increases in average selling prices. In
addition, the 2006 period had increased volumes from acquired businesses. The
2005 period was impacted by the effects of foreign currency translation while
the impact in 2006 was minimal.


Net
sales in 2006 increased 6% to $4,327.9 million compared with
$4,085.1 million in 2005. The components of the increase in net sales for
2006 were as follows (dollars in millions):

In 2006, foreign currency
translation had a negligible impact on net sales. During the first six months
of 2006, net sales had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation
primarily from the weakness of foreign currencies in Europe which were offset
in the second half of 2006 by their strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In
addition, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar strengthened all year
against the U.S. dollar offset by the weakness of foreign currencies in Asia
Pacific.

Net
sales for 2005 increased 8% to $4,085.1 million compared with
$3,798.1 million in 2004. The components of the increase in net sales for

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on
net sales of $57.3 million in 2005. Excluding the positive effect of
foreign currency translation, net sales would have increased 6% compared with
2004. The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales for the
full year of 2005 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies
in the Asia Pacific region, Brazil and Europe against the U.S. dollar. The
full year favorable impact of $57.3 million includes an unfavorable fourth
quarter impact of $10.9 million, primarily due to the weakness of foreign
currencies in Europe against the U.S. dollar.

Net sales of the Company’s
food packaging segment, which consists primarily of the Company’s Cryovac® food
packaging products, constituted 62% of net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
Company’s protective packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales.
This segment aggregates the Company’s protective packaging products and shrink
packaging products, all of which are used principally for non-food packaging
applications.

Food Packaging
Segment Sales

Net sales of food packaging products increased 7% in
2006 to $2,702.9 million compared with $2,532.1 million in 2005 and
increased 8% in 2005 compared with $2,346.9 million in 2004. Foreign
currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of
$2.4 million in 2006

and when this
impact is excluded, it would not have changed the net sales increase over the
prior year. When compared with 2004,

excluding the positive foreign
currency translation effect of $42.3 million, net sales for this segment in
2005 would have increased 6% compared with 2004.


During 2006, strong unit
volume growth, primarily in Latin America, the positive impact of the Company’s
2006 acquisitions and selling price increases in North America added to sales
growth during the year. In 2005 unit volumes increased in all regions of the
world, with the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions having the primary
impact. The segment also benefited in 2005 from price/mix due in part to
selling price increases.

Flexible Packaging
Materials and Related Systems

Among the classes of products in the food packaging
segment, net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems
increased 6% to $2,247.6 million in 2006 compared with $2,122.8 million in
2005 and increased 7% in 2005 compared with 2004 net sales of
$1,976.5 million. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of
$3.0 million in 2006 for flexible packaging materials and related systems.
Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, the increase in net
sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have remained
the same at 6% compared with 2005.

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of
$37.3 million in 2005 for flexible packaging materials and related systems.
Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect, net sales for
flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 6%
compared with 2004.

million compared with $409.3 million in 2005 and increased 11% in 2005
compared with 2004 net sales of $370.4 million.

Foreign currency translation had a minimal unfavorable
impact of $0.6 million in 2006 for rigid packaging and absorbent pads.
Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, the increase
in net sales in 2006 would have remained the same at 11% compared with 2005. Foreign
currency translation had a favorable impact of $5.1 million in 2005 for
rigid packaging and absorbent pads. Excluding the positive effect of foreign

The Company sells foam and
solid plastic trays and containers that customers use to package a wide variety
of food products. The Company manufactures such products in its own facilities
in various regions or has them fabricated by other manufacturers. The Company’s
net sales of such products fabricated by other manufacturers were
$157.3 million, $119.4 million and $83.5 million in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Protective
Packaging Segment Sales

Net sales of protective packaging products increased
5% to $1,625.0 million in 2006 compared with $1,553.0 million in 2005
and increased 7% in 2005 compared with 2004 sales of $1,451.2 million. During
2006, the positive impact of selling price increases in North America helped
drive sales growth. In 2005, sales growth in this segment was balanced between
unit volume growth of $39.7 million, primarily in North America, and a
positive price/mix impact of $37.5 million, primarily in North America and
to a lesser extent in Europe, in part due to selling price increases.

Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact
of $1.0 million in 2006 for this segment,which would not have changed the net
sales growth compared with 2005. In 2005, foreign currency translation had a
favorable impact of $15 million for this segment. Excluding the positive
foreign currency translation effect, net sales in 2005 for the protective
packaging segment would have increased 6% compared with 2004.

The classes of products within
the protective packaging segment are cushioning and surface protection products
and other products. Other products within the protective packaging segment
represented approximately 1% of consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Sales by Geographic
Region

Net
sales from operations in the United States represented 48% of net sales in 2006
and 2005. Net sales from U.S. operations increased 5% in 2006 to
$2,066.3 million compared with $1,972.9 million in 2005. Net sales
from international operations increased 7% in 2006 to $2,261.6 million
compared with $2,112.2 million in 2005. Excluding the $1.4 million
positive foreign currency translation effect, the increase in international net
sales would have remained the same at 7% compared with 2005. The components of

Costs and Margins

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 28.7% in
2006, 28.3% in 2005 and 30.6% in 2004. The increase in gross profit in 2006 was
due to the positive impact of selling price increases combined with improved
operating efficiencies that helped offset higher average petrochemical-based
raw material and other energy-related costs compared with the prior year. During
the first three quarters of 2006, petrochemical-based raw material and other
energy-related costs were higher than in the corresponding 2005 quarter. During
the fourth quarter of 2006, certain petrochemical-based commodity raw material
prices moderated but most speciality resin costs were at or above 2005 levels.

The principal cause for the reduction in 2005 compared
with 2004 was significantly higher petrochemical-based raw material and
other energy-related costs. Over this time frame, the prices of crude oil
and natural gas, which serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of many
of the resins the Company buys, increased significantly. Although changes in
prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks, they are
indicative of the variations in raw material and energy-related costs
faced by the Company. In addition, the decrease in gross profit was also caused
in part by an unfavorable shift in product mix, which was partially offset by
increases in selling prices.

Marketing, administrative and
development expenses increased 9% in 2006 and 3% in 2005. The increase in 2006
was due to higher year-on-year management incentive compensation of
approximately $11.0 million as the Company met most of its performance objectives
in 2006, incremental spending related to the upgrade of the Company’s
information technology platform of approximately $10.0 million, operating
expenses of businesses acquired during the year including Nelipak Holdings B.V. in January 2006
and Biosphere Industries, LLC in October 2006 of approximately $12.0
million in the aggregate and expenses to support the higher volume in net
sales.

The increase in 2005 was due to the impact of foreign
currency translation, higher professional fees, and, to a lesser extent,
expenses for research and development related projects, partially offset by a
reduction in management incentive compensation as the Company did not meet certain
performance objectives for 2005 and partial year savings from restructuring
activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2004, as discussed below.

Marketing, administrative
and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.2% in 2006, 15.8%
in 2005 and 16.5% in 2004.


Global
Manufacturing Strategy and Restructuring Charges

Global Manufacturing Strategy

The Company’s global
manufacturing strategy, when implemented, will expand production in countries
where demand for the Company’s products and services has been growing
significantly. At the same time, the Company intends to realign certain
manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe into centers of excellence.
The goals of this multi-year program are to expand capacity in growing markets,
further improve the Company’s operating efficiencies, and implement new
technologies more effectively. The Company expects this program, combined with
the Company’s supply chain initiative, to produce meaningful savings in future
years. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a
global scale, the Company expects to continue to enhance its profitable growth
and its global leadership position.

In July 2006,
the Company announced the first phase of this multi-year global manufacturing
strategy. The financial scope of this phase is expected to be as follows:

The Company expects the capital expenditures and charges for associated costs
to occur between 2007 and 2008, although the actual timing of these
expenditures is subject to change due to a variety of factors. The Company’s
estimated savings resulting from implementing this strategy are expected to
range from $55 to $65 million annually starting in 2009. A portion of these
savings will be realized starting in 2007.

During
2006, all charges for the associated costs related to the food packaging
segment and consisted of the following:

The Company has accrued $11.6 million in severance
costs in connection with this strategy. These costs will be future cash
expenditures that will be incurred for one-time termination benefits. At the
time the severance was accrued, the Company expected to eliminate 242 full-time
positions. Since that time, the Company revised the number of positions to be
eliminated to 245. During 2006, 36 positions were eliminated and the remaining
positions are expected to be eliminated in 2007. The Company expects these
benefits will be paid out before the end of 2009. The Company expects to add
approximately 120 full-time employees at other facilities as production is
transferred, so the net reduction in positions is expected to be 125. The
Company reflected the $11.6 million of severance costs in its consolidated
statement of operations for 2006 in restructuring charges.


The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through
December 31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31,
2006 were as follows:

The Company expects to pay

2007. This amount is reflected in other current liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. The remaining accrual of
$5.2 million is expected to be paid in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in
other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2006.

Other 2006
Restructuring Activities

During 2006, the Company
accrued severance costs of $0.6 million related to the Company’s consolidation
of its food packaging customer service activities in Canada. Such amount was
reflected in the consolidated statement of operations on the restructuring
charges line. The Company expects to eliminate 9 full-time positions. No cash
payments were made during 2006 related to this accrual. The accrual balance at
December 31, 2006 was $0.6 million which was reflected in other current
liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

2004 Restructuring
Program

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic
regions in order to complement the Company’s long-term growth programs and
financial goals, improve the Company’s operating efficiencies and lower its
overall cost structure. The plans principally reduced the number of employees
and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the Company’s reportable
business segments.

At December 31, 2004, the Company expected to
eliminate 473 full-time positions, which was increased to 475 during 2005. As
an element of the program, the Company expected to add approximately 100
positions in connection with the Company’s realignment or relocation of some of
its manufacturing activities, so that the net reduction in positions was
approximately 375. These actions affected principally production workers and
members of the Company’s sales force, primarily in Europe. The Company has
completed its reduction in headcount related to its 2004 restructuring program.

The
charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of the following:

The long-lived asset
impairment of $10.3 million consisted of write-downs and write-offs
of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to rationalize
and realign production of some of the Company’s smaller product lines and to
close several smaller European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted
cash flows associated with these asset groups, including estimated salvage
value, were less


than the
carrying values of these asset groups, they were written down to their
estimated fair value. The Company disposed of these facilities and much of the
equipment during the first six months of 2006.

The Company expects to pay

and $0.1 million in 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
recorded in its consolidated statement of operations an additional
restructuring charge of $0.6 million which was related to the 2004
program. This amount includes additional costs related to the relocation of
employees and assets from closed facilities which were completed in 2006. The
Company also recorded in its consolidated statement of operations a net credit
of $0.1 million related to employee termination costs that were accrued as part
of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded
amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated employees of
$0.1 million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being
eligible for the termination benefits of $0.2 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
recorded $1.7 million of additional charges related to the 2004
restructuring program. This amount includes $1.3 million of costs incurred
in 2005 related to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that
were closed as part of the restructuring program. The Company also recorded a
net charge of $0.4 million related to the employee termination costs that
were accrued as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to
the originally recorded amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to
terminated employees of $0.9 million and reductions based upon certain
employees no longer being eligible for the termination benefits of
$0.5 million.

The Company estimates that the cost savings realized
in 2006 were $25.0 to $30.0 million.

Operating Profit

Operating profit increased 3% in 2006 and 1% in 2005.
The increase in 2006 was due to an increase in net sales partially offset by
higher petrochemical-based raw material and other energy-related
costs, an increase of $55.2 million in marketing, administrative and
development expenses and an increase of $11.2 million in restructuring
charges in 2006.

The increase in 2005 was due to an increase in net
sales and a decrease of $31.3 million in restructuring and other charges,
partially offset by higher petrochemical-based raw material and other
energy-related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in marketing,
administrative and development expenses. As a percentage of net sales,
operating profit was 12.2% in 2006, 12.5% in 2005 and 13.2% in 2004.


Operating profit by

The food packaging segment
contributed 58%, 63% and 59% of the Company’s operating profit in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively, before taking into consideration restructuring and
other (charges) credits and unallocated corporate operating expenses. The
Company’s protective packaging segment contributed the balance of operating
profit.

Food Packaging Operating Profit

Food packaging operating
profit was 11.5%, 12.8% and 13.6% of food packaging net sales in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The decline in operating profit as a percentage of net
sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher raw material
costs, particularly specialty resins, higher energy-related costs, the higher
marketing, administrative and development expenses referenced above and
expenses related to the implementation of the Company’s global manufacturing
strategy also referenced above, offset by the improved contribution from
increased net sales.

The decline in operating
profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to
higher raw material and energy-related costs combined with an unfavorable
shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases.

Protective Packaging Operating Profit

Protective packaging
operating profit was 14.1%, 12.2% and 15.0% of protective packaging net sales
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in operating profit as a
percentage of net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to selling price
increases, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe, and
improved performance in North America and Europe based on management actions
taken to improve profitability, which helped offset higher raw material and
energy-related costs.

The decline in operating
profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to
higher raw material and energy-related costs combined with an unfavorable
shift in product mix, partially offset by selling price increases.

Interest Expense

Interest expense includes
the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior
debt issuance costs, bond discounts and terminated treasury locks. These
expenses were $148.0 million in 2006, $

149.7 million
in 2005, and $153.7 million in 2004.

The
decrease in interest expense in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to
the following:

·

a $7.5 million decrease due to the

retirement
of the Company’s 5.625% euro notes in July 2006 discussed below; and

·

a decrease of $1.8 million
related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital
investment projects in 2006 compared with the 2005 period;


partially
offset by;

·

$5.0
million

due to the impact of higher
interest rates on the Company’s $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate
swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008
into floating rate debt; and

·

an
increase of $1.7 million caused by additional expense related to the
compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos
settlement agreement.

The
decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to
the following:

·

a
$12.5 million decrease due to the redemption of the entire outstanding
principal amount, $177.5 million, of the Company’s 8.75% senior notes due July 2008,
the repurchase of $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009,
and the termination of related interest rate swaps with a total notional amount
of $150 million, all in the fourth quarter of 2004;

p

artially offset by;

·

an
increase of $4.7 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the
Company’s $300.0 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into
to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 into
floating rate debt;

·

an
increase of $1.6 million caused by additional expense related to the
compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos
settlement agreement; and

·

an increase of
$1.4 million related to lower capitalized interest during the construction
of capital investment projects in 2005 compared with the 2004 period.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net, was
$22.0 million in 2006, $15.9 million in 2005, and $5.8 million
in 2004. Included in these amounts are primarily interest and dividend income
of $16.8 million, $11.1 million and $7.7 million and net foreign
exchange transaction losses of $4.1 million, $4.7 million and
$9.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Loss On Debt Redemption
and Repurchases

In 2004 the Company
incurred losses of $32.2 million due to debt redemptions and repurchases.
These losses were reflected in the statement of operations in “Loss on debt
redemption and repurchases.” See below under the caption “Analysis of Historical
Cash Flows—Debt Redemption and Repurchases” for further discussion of these
transactions.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective
income tax rate was 31.5% in 2006, 32.1% in 2005 and 33.3% in 2004. The
decrease in the 2006 effective income tax rate compared with 2005 was primarily
due to a shift in the mix of foreign earnings. The Company currently expects an
effective income tax rate of approximately 31.5% for 2007.

The decrease in the 2005
effective income tax rate compared with 2004 was primarily due to the reversal
of reserves for tax matters for periods that closed in the relevant
jurisdictions.

In 2006 and 2005 the
effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax
rate of 35.0% primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on
foreign earnings, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes.


Net Earnings

As a result of the factors
noted above, net earnings were $274.1 million in 2006, $255.8 million
in 2005 and $215.6 million in 2004.

Earnings per Common
Share

Basic earnings per common
share were $3.38 for 2006, $3.09 for 2005 and $2.56 for 2004. Diluted earnings
per common share were $2.93 for 2006, $2.69 for 2005 and $2.25 for 2004.

In calculating diluted
earnings per common share, the Company’s calculation of the weighted average
number of common shares for 2006, 2005 and 2004 provides for the conversion of
the Company’s 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033, the assumed
issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the Company’s previously
announced asbestos settlement and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net
of assumed treasury stock repurchases. See Note 18, “Earnings Per Common Share,”
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in
Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Material
Commitments and Contingencies

Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related to the
Cryovac Transaction

The Company recorded a
charge of $850.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, of which
$512.5 million covers a cash payment that the Company is required to make
upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R.
Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in any period with respect to
this liability, and the Company cannot predict when it will be required to make
this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a
combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations and funds
available under its $500 million senior unsecured multi-currency
credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both
described below, or a combination of these alternatives. The cash payment of
$512.5 million accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate, which is compounded
annually, from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has
recorded this accrued interest in other current liabilities in its consolidated
balance sheets, and these amounts were $123.5 million and
$90.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company is subject to
other contingencies related to the Cryovac transaction. Note 16, “Commitments
and Contingencies,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
describes these contingencies under “Contingencies Related to the Cryovac
Transaction” and is incorporated herein by reference.


Compliance Matters

The information set forth
in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in
Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements under the caption “Compliance Matters” is incorporated
herein by reference.

of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028. See Note 10, “Debt and Credit
Facilities,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

This
liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the
timing of payment. Interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 5.5% per annum,
compounded annually, until it becomes due and payable.

Current
Portion of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt

—

The debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond
discounts and interest rate swap adjustments as of December 31, 2006 and
therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in
each period.

Operating
Leases

—

In addition to
the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed
above, the Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases
covering some of the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment,
most of which are accounted for as operating leases. The contractual operating
lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum
annual rental commitments under non-cancelable real and personal property
leases as of December 31, 2006.

Asbestos
Settlement

—

The asbestos
settlement is described more fully in “Asbestos Settlement; Commitments Related
to the Cryovac Transaction,” above.

Cash
Dividend

—

On February
16, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly
cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash
dividend payable on the pre-split shares of the Company’s common stock on March
16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2007.
The estimate of this liability is $16.1 million and was calculated using
80,672,810 shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding as of
January 31, 2006.


Other
Principal Contractual Obligations

—

Other
principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated
amount of goods, including raw materials, or services in the normal course of
business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant
terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or
variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has reviewed its off-balance sheet arrangements
and has determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably
likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.  For a discussion of one such
arrangement that may have a future effect that is material to investors, see
“Accounts Receivable Securitization Program,” below.

Interest Payments

During 2006 and 2005, the
Company paid $121.9 million and $117.0 million, respectively, in
interest payments. The Company currently expects to pay from
$105.0 million to $115.0 million in interest payments in 2007,
including the impact of interest rate swap transactions. The actual interest
paid in 2007 may be different from this amount if interest rates change or if
the Company repurchases existing indebtedness or incurs indebtedness under its
existing lines of credit or otherwise. This 2007 expected interest payment does
not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement.

Income Tax Payments

During 2006 and 2005, the
Company paid $152.6 million and $152.2 million, respectively, in income
taxes. The Company currently expects to pay between $187.0 million and
$197.0 million in income taxes in 2007, assuming it does not make the
asbestos settlement payment in that year.

Contributions to
Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans
for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non-U.S.
employees. During 2006 and 2005, the Company paid $7.8 million and
$8.6 million, respectively, in employer contributions to these defined
benefit pension plans. The Company currently expects employer contributions to
be $6.8 million in 2007.

Environmental
Matters

The Company is subject to
loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it
accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation
efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be
reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting
for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible
that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of
operations, balance sheets or cash flows. The Company reassesses environmental
liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or it can better
estimate remediation efforts and their costs. The Company evaluates these
liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress
of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with
regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the
apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these
issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new
sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts
the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures
are not material to its consolidated results of operations, balance sheets and
cash flows. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all
probable and estimable environmental exposures.


Principal Sources of Liquidity

The Company’s principal
sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and short-term investments, cash
flows from operations and amounts available under its existing lines of credit
described below, including the credit facility, the ANZ facility and its
accounts receivable securitization program.

Accumulated Cash
and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

As of December 31,
2006 and 2005, the Company had accumulated cash and cash equivalents of
$373.1 million and $455.8 million, respectively, and short-term
investments of $33.9 million and $44.1 million, respectively. The
Company’s short-term investments consist of auction rate securities, all of
which are classified as available-for-sale securities. See Note 4, “Short
Term Investments—Available for Sale Securities,” to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements, which describes these short-term investments.

Cash Flows from
Operations

The Company expects that
it will continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. See “Analysis
of Historical Cash Flows” below.

Lines of Credit

The
following table summarizes the Company’s available lines of credit and
committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit facity and the
ANZ facility discussed below, at December 31, 2006 and 2005:

Revolving Credit
Facilities

The
Credit Facility

—The Company has not borrowed under its $500.0 million
unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility since its inception in July 2005.
This facility contains a provision under which the Company may request, prior
to each of the first and second anniversaries of the facility, a one-year
extension of the termination of the facility. The Company requested an
extension effective on the first anniversary, July 26, 2006, and lenders
with commitments for $457.0 million under the facility consented to the
extension. Accordingly, on July 26, 2006 this extension became effective,
as a result of which $43.0 million of the facility will terminate on July 26,
2010, and $457.0 million of the facility will terminate on July 26, 2011.

The credit facility is available for general corporate
purposes including the payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash
payment, plus accrued interest (which was $123.5 million at December 31,
2006), required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of
reorganization in the


W. R. Grace & Co.
bankruptcy. See Note 10, “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the Notes to the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this
credit facility.

ANZ
Facility—

The Company has an Australian dollar
170 million, dual-currency revolving credit facility, known as the ANZ
facility, equivalent to U.S. $132.9 million at December 31, 2006, due
March 2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group
of the Company’s Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The
Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time
prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility.

The Company borrowed under
the ANZ facility during the second quarter of 2006, but it repaid those amounts
in full and did not borrow further under the ANZ facility during 2006. There
were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006 or at
December 31, 2005.

See Note 10, “Debt
and Credit Facilities” of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion on this facility.

Other Lines of
Credit

Substantially all the
Company’s short-term borrowings of $20.2 million and $21.8 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were outstanding under lines of
credit available to several of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The weighted
average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 12.5% and 12.3%
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amounts available under these
credit lines as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately
$198.0 million and $200.1 million, respectively, of which
approximately $177.8 million and $178.3 million, respectively, were
unused.

Accounts Receivable
Securitization Program

The Company’s $125.0 million receivables program has
an expiration date of December 7, 2007. The receivables program contains
financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2006.

The Company’s receivables funding subsidiary did not
sell any receivables interests under the receivables program during 2006, and
therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated
assets reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2006.

During 2005, the Company’s receivables funding
subsidiary sold an undivided ownership interest in $35 million of eligible
receivables under the receivables program. Payments on the Company’s receivables
that were applied to these receivables interests in accordance with the terms
of the program reduced the amount of receivables interests held by the bank or
the issuer of commercial paper that are parties to the program to zero during
2005. Therefore, as of December 31, 2005, neither the bank nor the issuer
of commercial paper held any receivables interests, and the Company did not
remove any related amounts from the assets reflected on its consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2005.

See Note 5, “Accounts
Receivable Securitization Program,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information concerning this program.

Debt Ratings

The Company’s cost of
capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt
ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. The Company’s
long-term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (stable outlook) by
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and BBB (negative outlook) by Standard &
Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. These ratings are
among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade
long-term senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or


withdrawal
at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating.

the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the Company’s debt.

Analysis of Historical Cash Flows

Net Cash Provided
by Operating Activities

Net cash provided
by operating activities was $432.9 million in 2006, $363.3 million in 2005
and $436.2 million in 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating
activities in 2006 was due to various factors:

·

an
increase in cash generated from accounts receivable in 2006 compared with 2005
due to an increase in cash collections during 2006 that exceeded the increase
in net sales. In addition, during the 2006 period there was increased cash
received from vendor rebates receivable;

·

an
increase in accrued restructuring costs in 2006 due to the recording of $11.8
million of restructuring charges related to the global manufacturing strategy,
partially offset by $4.5 million in cash payments in 2006 related to the 2004
restructuring program and 2006 global manufacturing charge. Cash payments
related to the 2004 restructuring program made in 2005 were $16.8 million;

·

an
increase in income taxes payable in the 2006 period due to higher income tax
expense;

·

an
increase in accrued payroll in the 2006 period partially due to higher
management incentive compensation; and

·

the
timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business;


partially offset
by;

·

an
increase in cash used for inventory in the 2006 period due to higher resin
costs affecting all categories of inventory and higher raw material quantities
in the 2006 period. Raw material inventory quantities were lower in the 2005
period in part due to the storm-related depletion of the Company’s resin
supplies. In addition, higher inventories were needed in 2006 to support the
Company’s global manufacturing strategy as projects got underway to shift
production consistent with the Company’s centers of excellence approach.

The reduction in
net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to
various factors:

·

a
reduction in cash generated from accounts payable balances. The cash generated
in 2005 was $16.7 million compared with $48.5 million in 2004;

·

cash
used of $16.8 million in 2005 compared with cash used of $0.6 million
in 2004 for employee termination and facility exit cost payments related to its
2004 restructuring program;

·

an
increase in cash used for income tax payments in 2005. The Company made cash
payments of $152.2 million in 2005 compared with $141.9 million in
2004; and

·

an
increase in notes and accounts receivable due to higher net sales in 2005,
partially offset by an increase in cash collections during 2005;

partially offset
by;

·

a
reduction in cash used for inventory due to higher inventory turnover in the
2005 period, partially offset by higher raw material costs; and

·

a
change in accrued interest of $11.3 million. Accrued interest increased
$31.8 million in 2005 compared with an increase of $20.5 million in
2004. The increase in the 2005 period was primarily due to an increase of
$31.4 million due to additional accrued interest related to the Company’s
liability under the asbestos settlement agreement, which is compounded
annually. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest
of $29.8 million related to the asbestos settlement agreement, partially
offset by a reduction of $6.3 million in accrued interest related to the
8.75% senior notes, which were repurchased in 2003.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in
investing activities amounted to $202.5 million in 2006, $88.9 million in
2005 and $91.0 million in 2004. The increase in net cash used for
investing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the
following:

·

$53.3
million of cash used to complete acquisitions in 2006 of which $41.2 million
was for the previously announced acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. on January 3,
2006; and

·

an
increase of $71.0 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were
$167.9 million in 2006 compared with $96.9 million in 2005.

The decrease in net
cash used in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following:

·

a
decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in 2005 were $96.9
million compared with $102.7 million in 2004; and

·

lower
levels of cash used for businesses acquired. In 2005 cash used was $0.2 million
compared with $6.4 million in 2004;


partially offset
by;

·

lower net proceeds from the
sale of available-for-sale securities in 2005 compared with 2004. See Note 4,
“Short Term Investments—Available for Sale Securities,” of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which describes these
available-for-sale securities.

Acquisitions

Cash used to complete
acquisitions was $53.3 million in 2006, $0.2 million in 2005 and
$6.4 million in 2004. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of
cash acquired in those acquisitions. The cash acquired in those acquisitions
was immaterial. The Company assumed $9.6 million of debt related to the Nelipak
Holdings B.V. acquisition in 2006. In 2005 and 2004, the Company did not assume
any debt related to acquisitions.

Capital
Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $167.9 million in 2006,
$96.9 million in 2005 and $102.7 million in 2004. Capital
expenditures for the Company’s food packaging segment amounted to
$142.4 million, $80.7 million and $81.3 million and for the
protective packaging segment amounted to $25.5 million, $16.2 million and
$21.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The increase in capital
expenditures in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to

investments in
capacity expansion and in new technologies related to the Company’s centers of
excellence approach as well as global manufacturing capital expenditures of
$14.2 million.

The decrease in capital expenditures in 2005 compared
with 2004 was primarily due to the completion of two new production facilities,
one in the United States and one in Hungary, which the Company initiated in
2003 and completed in the early part of 2004. The improved productivity of
existing assets allowed the Company to defer spending on incremental capacity
in 2005.

The Company expects to
continue to invest capital as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to
replace depreciating property, plant and equipment, to acquire new
manufacturing technology and to improve productivity. Taking into account
capital expenditures in 2007 of $60.0 to $80.0 million on the Company’s global
manufacturing strategy, the Company expects total capital expenditures in 2007
to range between $175.0 million and $200.0 million. This projection is based
upon the Company’s capital expenditure budget for 2007, the status of approved
but not yet completed capital projects, anticipated future projects including
the implementation of the Company’s global manufacturing strategy and historic
spending trends.

Net Cash Used in
Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities amounted to
$350.0 million in 2006, $118.4 million in 2005 and
$300.3 million in 2004.

The increase in net
cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due
to the following:

·

$251.7
million of cash used to retire the Company’s 5.625% euro notes on July 19,
2006; and

·

$48.6
million of cash used in 2006 to pay dividends on the Company’s common stock;

partially offset by;

·

a
decrease in cash used in 2006 for the repurchase of shares of the Company’s
common stock, as discussed in “Repurchases of Capital Stock” below. Cash used
in 2006 was $52.4 million compared with $116.4 million of cash used in 2005.


The decrease in net cash used in financing activities
in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following:

·

$232.3 million of cash
used in 2004 for the debt repurchases and redemptions made in the fourth
quarter of 2004;

partially offset by;

·

an increase in 2005 of
$30.2 million in net cash used to repurchase shares of the Company’s
common stock, as discussed below. In 2005, the Company used $116.4 million
to repurchase its common stock compared with $86.2 million in 2004; and

·

a
decrease of $20.3 million in proceeds from long-term debt in 2005 compared
with 2004.

Repurchases of Capital
Stock

In 2006,
the Company repurchased 1,049,200 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10
per share, in open market purchases at a cost of $52.4 million. The average
price per share of these common stock repurchases in 2006 was $49.90.

In 2005, the Company repurchased 2,430,200 shares of
its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases at a cost
of $116.4 million in 2005. The average price per share of these common
stock repurchases in 2005 was $47.88.

In 2004, the Company repurchased 1,781,000 shares of
its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, in open market purchases, at a
cost of $86.2 million in 2004. The average price per share of the common
stock repurchases in 2004 was $48.38.

The share repurchases described above were made under
a program previously adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors. The share
repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up to 16,977,147 shares of
common stock, which included the Series A convertible preferred stock on
an as-converted basis prior to its redemption. As of December 31, 2006,
the Company had repurchased 15,376,571 shares of common stock and preferred
stock on an as-converted basis, and the remaining repurchase authorization
covered 1,600,576 shares of common stock. The Company may from time to time
continue to repurchase its common stock.

Debt Redemption and
Repurchases

2004 Debt
Redemption:

On November 26, 2004, the Company used net cash
of $211.8 million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal
amount, $177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2008
and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes having a total
notional amount of $150.0 million. The Company issued the senior notes on June 26,
2001 under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933.
The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with the indenture
governing the notes. The net cash used of $211.8 million consisted of cash
used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of
$213.4 million and cash received of $1.6 million related to the
termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption,
funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes, which
resulted in a loss of $29.6 million, which the Company reflected in the
statement of operations as “Loss on debt redemption and repurchases.” The
annual interest expense on the redeemed notes was approximately
$15.5 million, without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the
amortization of amounts related to the senior notes.

2004 Debt
Repurchases

In November and December 2004, the Company
used available cash of $25.2 million to repurchase in the open market
$22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009,
which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed
these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a
loss of $2.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of
operations as “Loss on debt redemption and repurchases.”


The Company may from time to time continue to
repurchase or otherwise retire its outstanding indebtedness.

Changes in Working Capital

At
December 31, 2006, working capital (current assets less current
liabilities) was $350.6 million compared with $161.9 million at
December 31, 2005. The $188.7 million increase in the Company’s working
capital during 2006 arose primarily from the following changes:

·

an
increase of $100.3 million in inventory. This increase was due to various
factors which included the following:

·

$46.6
million from the Company’s application on January 1, 2006 of Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” known as
SAB 108. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on this new accounting standard;

·

$16.1
million from the effects of foreign currency translation;

·

an
increase in raw materials inventory due to lower raw material inventory
quantities in the 2005 period in part due to the storm-related depletion of the
Company’s resin supplies; and

·

higher
inventories in 2006 needed to support the Company’s global manufacturing
strategy for projects began during 2006 to shift production consistent with the
centers of excellence approach.

·

a
decrease of $235.9 million in the current portion of long-term debt of which
$251.7 million was due to the retirement of the 5.625% euro notes in July 2006;

·

an
increase of $47.3 million in accounts receivable. This increase was
primarily due to $30.9 million from the effects of foreign currency
translation and, to a lesser extent, due to an increase in net sales in 2006, partially
offset by increased cash collections which includes cash received from vendor
rebates receivable;

partially
offset by;

·

a
decrease of $92.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments due to $251.7 million of cash used to retire the Company’s 5.625%
euro notes as noted above, $48.6 million of cash used in 2006 to pay dividends
on the Company’s common stock, $53.3 million of cash used in 2006 for
businesses acquired of which $41.2 million was due to the the previously
announced acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. on January 3, 2006, and
$52.4 million of cash used to repurchase the Company’s common stock discussed
above, partially offset by cash flow generated from operations;

·

an
increase of $33.6 million in accounts payable, which includes $10.9 million
from the effects of foreign currency. The balance of the increase was primarily
due to the increased levels of inventory;

·

an
increase of $28.1 million in accrued interest primarily due to an additional
$33.2 million of accrued interest during 2006 related to the Company’s
liability under the asbestos settlement agreement, partially offset by a
decrease of $6.7 million due to the retirement of the Company’s 5.625% euro
notes in July 2006; and

·

an increase of $25.5 million
in accrued payroll. This increase was primarily due to increased payroll-related
costs, including an increase in the accrual for management incentive
compensation in 2006 since the Company met most of its 2006 performance
objectives and $6.2 million from the effects of foreign currency translation.


Current and Quick Ratios

The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.2 at December 31,
2006 and 1.1 at December 31, 2005. The ratio of current assets less
inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.9 at December 31,
2006 and 0.8 at December 31, 2005.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements

The Company is subject to
numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards,
accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 22, “New Accounting
Pronouncements—Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting
Guidance and Disclosure Requirements,” of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, describes these new accounting
pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The Company’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based
upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America, known as US GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and
assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and
other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of
these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and
liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results,
under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ
from estimates, and while any differences may be material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe that the
differences, taken as a whole, will be material.

The Company believes the
following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the
understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements:

Accounts Receivable—In the
normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy
pre-defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, as shown on the consolidated
balance sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company
maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may
be required if the financial condition of the Company’s customers deteriorates.

Commitments and
Contingencies—Litigation—On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential
liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is
typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these
actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that
it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of
these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any,
can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the
amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it
believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation
and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be
resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures
that the Company has previously made. The Company expenses legal costs,
including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss
contingency, as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets—The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill,
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, is reviewed for possible impairment at least
annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill


may be
initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.
Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such
as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of
long-lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Self-Insurance—The Company
retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property,
casualty, workers’ compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company
accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not
reported, and projected claims based upon management’s estimates of the
aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance
company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management
believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim
payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded
liabilities.

Pensions—

The Company maintains a non-contributory profit
sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most
U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number
of its U.S. employees and for some of its non-U.S. employees, the Company
maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for these pension
plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.” Under this accounting standard,
the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations
and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount
rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on
plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various
other actuarial assumptions. The measurement date used to determine the benefit
obligations and the plan assets is December 31. In general, changes to
these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities
recorded under SFAS No. 158.

Income Taxes—The Company’s
deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax
benefit carry forwards. The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings
during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized
should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For
those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or
the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the
Company provides a valuation allowance.

In assessing the need for
a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with
consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the
realizability of tax benefit carry forwards, to determine which deferred tax
assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation
allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax
laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event
that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company
may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In calculating its
worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax
positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based
on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and
interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities.
The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and
circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law.

Educational
Donation

During the second quarter
of 2006, the Company donated $1.5 million to the Harvard Business School
in partial funding of a professorship in the name of T. J. Dermot Dunphy. Mr. Dunphy,
a director of the Company, was Chief Executive Officer of the Company from March 1971
until his retirement in February 2000. He received a Master’s degree in Business
Administration from the school in 1956.


Non-GAAP Information

The Company’s management from time to time presents
information that does not conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, including changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign
currency translation. The Company’s management uses changes in net sales
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation to measure the
performance of the Company’s operations. Thus, management believes that this
information may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the
criteria upon which performance-based compensation may be determined.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may
adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The Company
seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing
activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative
financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rates

From time to time, the Company may use interest rate
swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates.

The Company’s interest rate swaps are described in
Note 11, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” of the Notes to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II, Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
Capital Resources—Derivative Financial Instruments—Interest Rate Swaps”
contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no
collars or options outstanding.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value
of the Company’s total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest
rate swaps, was $1,852.3 million and $2,076.2 million, respectively. The
Company’s fixed rate debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005, including the
impact of interest rate swaps, was $1,531.4 million and
$1,767.7 million, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s fixed rate
debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed
rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates
rise. The estimated fair value of the Company’s total debt, including the
impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $1,885.9 million at December 31,
2006 compared with $2,135.7 million at December 31, 2005. A
hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the
fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2006 of $81.6 million.
These changes in the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt do not alter
the Company’s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such
debt.

Foreign Exchange Rates

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to
fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. A
hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates at December 31,
2006 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $20.7 million to
terminate these contracts.

The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are
described in Note 11, “Derivatives and Hedging Activities,” of the Notes
to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Part II,
Item 8 and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Derivative Financial
Instruments—Foreign Currency Forward Contracts” contained in Part II, Item
7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


The Company may use other derivative instruments from
time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to
foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access
to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can
potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate
exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings
denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap
agreements outstanding.

The Company’s outstanding
debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing
subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating
cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of
assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $34.4 million and $262.8 million
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2006 compared
with 2005 was due to the maturity of the Company’s 5.625% euro notes with a
face value of

€

200.0 million as
discussed above.

Commodities

The Company uses various
commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as
electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes.
Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not
use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Company’s
supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw
material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess
inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance
of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks
related to changes in commodity prices of these components.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Sealed Air Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’
equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2006. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited consolidated
financial statement Schedule II—Valuation and qualifying accounts and
reserves. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of quantifying errors
effective January 1, 2006. Also, as discussed in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting
for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans effective December 31,
2006.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),” and our report
dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Amounts in tables in millions of dollars, except share and per share data)

Note 1 General

Sealed Air Corporation (the “Company”), operating
through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and
protective packaging products.

The Company conducts
substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US). These two
subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the
business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the
globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in connection with the
Cryovac transaction. See Note 16 for a description of the Cryovac
transaction and related terms used in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Note 2 Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all
significant inter-company transactions and balances in consolidation. All
amounts are approximate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. The principal
reclassification was related to investing activities of $5.1 million which were
reclassified from operating activities to investing activities in the Company’s
2005 consolidated statement of cash flows. This reclassification had no impact
on the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated balance sheets
and was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Company, in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements,” (SAB 108) increased its beginning retained earnings for
fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 21
for additional information on the application of SAB 108.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, known as U.S.
GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and
expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the
collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory,
the realization of deferred tax assets, useful lives and recoverability of
tangible and intangible assets, assumptions used in the Company’s defined
benefit pension plans, estimates related to self-insurance such as the
aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance
company estimates and estimated trends in claim values, valuation allowances
related to deferred taxes, and accruals for commitments and contingencies,
among others. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and
reflects the effects of revisions in the consolidated financial statements in
the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.


Financial
Instruments

The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest
rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign
exchange forward contracts and options relating to the Company’s borrowing and
trade activities.

The Company may use these financial instruments from
time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces
credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform
their obligations. However, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering
into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions
with high credit ratings.

The Company reports all derivative instruments on its
balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Prior to
entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific
financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce
the risk, and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging
instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis
for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged. The
Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high
correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews
its hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the
hedging instruments.

The Company accounts for derivative instruments as
hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these
derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective
as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions,
unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions.

The Company records gains and losses on derivatives
qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss), to the
extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time the Company
recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company recognizes gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the
related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the
consolidated statement of operations.

The Company’s practice is
to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability
matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains
or losses associated with derivative instruments, which on infrequent occasions
may be terminated prior to maturity, are recognized in the statement of
operations over the period in which the income or expense on the underlying
hedged transaction is recognized.

Foreign Currency
Translation

In non-U.S. locations that
are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance
sheets at the end of period exchange rates with translation adjustments
accumulated in shareholders’ equity. The Company translates the statements of
operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The
Company translates assets and liabilities of its operations in countries with
highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that
it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange
rates. The Company translates items reflected in statements of operations of
its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at average rates
of exchange prevailing during the period, except that it translates specified
financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates.


Commitments and
Contingencies—Litigation

On an ongoing basis, the
Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims
brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to determine the
timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best
judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to
the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable
estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable
losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if
any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent
uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential
insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for
amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the
Company has previously made. The Company expenses legal costs, including those
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
incurred.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue
earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and
the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company has completed the
process by which it is entitled to receive consideration. The following
criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an
arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

Research and
Development

The Company expenses research
and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were
$78.2 million, $75.8 million and $73.2 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the FASB, issued
SFAS No. 123 (revised), “Share-Based Payment” which replaces SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” SFAS No. 123 (revised) covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements and requires that the compensation cost related to
these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost
is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued.

The Company’s primary stock-based
employee compensation program is its 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, which replaced
the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan. See Note 17 for further information on
these plans.

Terminated Stock Option
Plans

As of March 31, 1998
in connection with the Cryovac transaction (see Note 16), the Company
terminated stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac
packaging business participated prior to that date, except with respect to options
that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been
granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying
shares on the date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of
the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to December 31,
2000. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no
plans to do so in the future.

Environmental
Expenditures

The Company expenses or
capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business
activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused


by past
operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The
Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments
or remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate
the cost or a range of costs associated therewith.

Income Taxes

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions.
The Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign
subsidiaries’ accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely
in their businesses.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset
and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company
determines deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period using
enacted tax rates.

The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings
during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized
should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those
jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the
projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company
provides a valuation allowance.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the
Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the
feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax
benefit carry forwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely
than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred
tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax
rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from
these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation
allowance, which could materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In calculating its
worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax
positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based
on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and
interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities.
The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances,
including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

The Company considers
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at
the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company’s policy is to invest
cash in excess of short-term operating and debt service requirements in cash
equivalents and short-term investments (discussed below). These instruments are
stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short maturity
of the instruments.

Short-Term
Investments—Available-for-Sale Securities

The Company’s short-term
investments consist of auction rate securities, which are classified as
available-for-sale securities. The Company determines the classification at the
time of purchase and reassesses it as of each balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale securities are marked-to-market based on quoted market
values of the securities, with the unrealized gains or losses, if any, reported
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
The Company recognizes realized gains and losses on the sales of the securities
on a specific identification method and includes them in other income, net, in
its consolidated statement of operations. The Company includes interest and
dividends on securities


classified
as available-for-sale in other income, net. The Company has classified its
available-for-sale securities as current assets regardless of their maturity as
they are highly liquid and available for use in current operations.

Accounts Receivable
Securitization

The Company’s two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries
are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they
sell eligible U.S. accounts receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into
this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn may sell an undivided
ownership interest in these receivables to a bank or an issuer of commercial
paper administered by that bank. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the
receivables it purchases from the two operating subsidiaries, except those as
to which it sells interests to the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper.
If the wholly-owned subsidiary sells undivided ownership interests in
receivables, the Company removes the transferred ownership interest amounts
from its consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sale and reflects the
proceeds from the sale in cash provided by operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Company reflects
retained receivables in accounts receivable on its consolidated balance sheet,
and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the
relatively short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated
with the sale of receivables in other income, net, in the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations.

Accounts Receivable

In the normal course of
business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined
credit criteria. Accounts receivable, as shown on the consolidated balance
sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains
accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may
be required if the financial condition of the Company’s customers deteriorates.

Inventories

The Company determines the
cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis.
The cost of U.S. equipment inventories and most non-U.S. inventories is
determined on a first-in, first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states
inventories at the lower of cost or market. The sale of inventory and the
related accounts receivable are classified as an operating activity in the
Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property and
Equipment

The Company states property and equipment at cost,
except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the
Company reduces the carrying amount to the estimated fair value at the
impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements, and the
Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of
the assets to expense as incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated
depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and
recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition of the assets.

The Company depreciates
the cost of property and equipment over its estimated useful life on a
straight-line basis as follows: buildings—20 to 40 years; machinery and equipment—5
to 10 years and other property and equipment—3 to 10 years.


Goodwill and
Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. The Company
reflects identifiable intangible assets in other assets at cost. These assets
consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and non-compete agreements.
The Company amortizes them over the shorter of their stated or statutory
duration or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally
ranging from 3 to 20 years. Identifiable intangibles, other than
goodwill, individually and in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the
Company’s consolidated assets and therefore are immaterial to the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets.

The Company uses the purchase method of accounting for
all business combinations and does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives, but instead tests such assets for impairment on a
reporting unit basis annually. The Company may initiate a review of goodwill
prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.

A reporting unit is the
operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment—the
“component” level—discrete financial information is prepared and regularly
reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are
different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the
operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit. The
Company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. The Company
must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an
estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and for each of the Company’s
reporting units using an income approach, which uses forecasted earnings and
cash flows, and a market approach, which uses comparisons to other businesses.
The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each year. In addition,  the Company
amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and
reviews these for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

Long-Lived Assets

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets,
other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future
undiscounted cash flows derived from long-lived assets are less than their
carrying value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount
equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The
Company records assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment, where
management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposition. The
Company suspends depreciation for these assets during the disposal period,
which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the
determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition
costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and possible
impairment expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations

The Company recognizes a
liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the
liability can be reasonably estimated. A conditional asset retirement
obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. In addition,
the Company would record a corresponding amount by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the useful
life of such long-lived asset.

Self-Insurance

The Company retains the
obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty,
workers’ compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for
outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported
and projected claims based upon management’s estimates of the aggregate
liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company
estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management
believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim
payments, it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from
the recorded liabilities.

Pensions

The Company maintains a
non-contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement
savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to
participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its
non-U.S. employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The
Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans.” Under this accounting standard, the Company makes assumptions regarding
the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The
principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future
obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected
rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions.
The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligations and the plan
assets is December 31. In general, changes to these assumptions could have
a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS
No. 158.

Earnings per Common
Share

The Company calculates
basic earnings per common share by dividing net earnings ascribed to common
shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.
The computation of diluted earnings per common share is similar, except that
the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period are adjusted to
reflect the potential issuance of dilutive shares, which includes the assumed
issuance of asbestos settlement shares and the effect of the conversion of the
Company’s 3% convertible senior notes, and net earnings ascribed to common
shareholders are adjusted to reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of
income taxes, that would occur as a result of the assumed conversion of the 3%
convertible senior notes.

Note 3 Business Segment Information

The Company operates in two reportable business
segments: (i) Food Packaging and (ii) Protective Packaging. The Food
Packaging segment comprises primarily the Company’s Cryovac® food packaging
products. The Protective Packaging segment includes the aggregation of the
Company’s protective packaging products and shrink packaging products, all of
which products are used principally for non-food packaging applications.


The Food Packaging segment consists primarily of
flexible materials and related systems such as shrink bag and film products,
non-shrink films, and associated packaging equipment systems marketed and sold
primarily under the Cryovac® trademark. Customers use these products to package
a broad range of perishable foods, as well as medical products. Also included
in this segment are rigid packaging and absorbent pads, such as foam and solid
plastic trays and containers for the packaging of a wide variety of food
products and absorbent pads used for the packaging of meat, fish and poultry.
Net sales of flexible materials and related systems were: 2006—$2,247.6 million;
2005—$2,122.8 million; and 2004—$1,976.5 million. Net sales of rigid
packaging and absorbent pads were: 2006—$455.3 million; 2005—$409.3 million;
and 2004—$370.4 million. The Company primarily sells products in this segment
to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service
businesses.

The
Protective Packaging segment consists primarily of cushioning and surface
protection products such as Bubble Wrap® cushioning and other air cellular
cushioning materials; shrink and non-shrink films principally for non-food
applications; polyurethane foam packaging systems sold under the Instapak®
trademark; polyethylene foam sheets and planks; Jiffy® mailers and bags and
other protective and durable mailers and bags; paper-based protective
packaging materials; suspension and retention packaging; inflatable packaging;
and packaging systems. Net sales of cushioning and surface protection products
were: 2006—$1,568.5 million; 2005—$1,502.0 million; and 2004—$1,396.4 million.
Net sales of other products for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately 1% of
consolidated net sales. The Company primarily sells products in this segment to
distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries.

Goodwill by
Reportable Business Segment

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” and because the
Company’s management views goodwill as a corporate asset, the Company has
allocated all of its goodwill to the corporate level rather than to the
individual segments. However, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” the Company has allocated goodwill to each
reportable segment in order to perform its annual impairment review of
goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year. See Note 8
for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment review.


The
allocation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 for the years ended

for additional information on the goodwill acquired during 2006.

Note 4 Short Term Investments—Available-for-Sale
Securities

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s
available-for-sale securities consisted of auction rate securities for which
interest or dividend rates are generally re-set for periods of up to
90 days. At December 31, 2006, the Company held $33.9 million of
auction rate securities which were investments in preferred stock with no
maturity dates. At December 31, 2005, the Company held $44.1 million
of auction rate securities, of which $34.7 million were investments in
preferred stock with no maturity dates and $9.4 million were investments
in other auction rate securities with contractual maturities in 2031.

At December 31, 2006
and 2005, the fair value of the available-for-sale securities held by the
Company was equal to their cost. There were no gross realized gains or losses
from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2006 and 2005.

Note 5 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program

In December 2001, the Company and a group of its
U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program
with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. On December 7,
2004, which was the scheduled expiration date of this program, the parties
extended this program for an additional term of three years ending December 7,
2007.

Under this receivables program, the Company’s two
primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation
(US), sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed Air Funding
Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that
was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables program.
Sealed Air Funding in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these
receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to
specified conditions, up to a maximum of $125.0 million of receivables
interests outstanding from time to time.

Sealed Air Funding retains the receivables it
purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells
receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper. The
Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating
subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from
Sealed Air Funding to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, as “true
sales” under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not
available to pay any creditors of the Company or of the Company’s other
subsidiaries or affiliates. The Company accounts for these transactions as
sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities.”


To secure the performance of their obligations under
the receivables program, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries
granted a first priority security interest to the bank, as agent, in accounts
receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and
other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse
to the Company’s, the operating subsidiaries’ or Sealed Air Funding’s other
assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to
pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a
termination event with respect to the receivables program has not occurred, the
operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the
receivables program as agents on behalf of Sealed Air Funding, the bank and the
issuer of commercial paper.

Prior to a termination event under the receivables
program, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise
required to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper to purchase
new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has
undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations
under the receivables program.

The receivables program contains financial covenants
relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance
with these ratios at December 31, 2006.

Under limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer
of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to
the above dates. A downgrade of the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt
to BB- or below by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Ba3 or below
by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or failure to comply with interest
coverage and debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the
receivables program.

The operating subsidiaries did not sell any
receivables interests under the receivables program during 2006, and therefore
the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets
reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2006.

During 2005, Sealed Air Funding sold an undivided
ownership interest in $35.0 million of eligible receivables under the
receivables program. Payments on the Company’s receivables that were applied to
these receivables interests in accordance with the terms of the program reduced
the amount of receivables interests held by the bank or the issuer of
commercial paper that are parties to the program to zero during 2005.
Therefore, as of December 31, 2005, neither the bank nor the issuer of
commercial paper held any receivables interests and the Company did not remove
any related amounts from the assets reflected on its consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the receivables
program provided for a program fee of 0.375% per annum on the greater of the
unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding and 50%
of the $125.0 million purchase limit under the program. The receivables
program also provided for a commitment fee of 0.20% per annum on the lesser of
the unused portion of the program and 50% of the purchase limit under the
program.

The costs associated with
the receivables program are reflected in other income, net, in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004. These costs primarily relate to program and commitment
fees and other associated costs, which were $0.3 million,
$0.4 million and $0.5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The costs related to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the
bank or the issuer of commercial paper during 2005 were immaterial. There were
no costs related to the loss on the sale of receivables interests in 2006 and
2004 since the Company did not sell any receivables interests during those
years.

The Company determines the value of non-equipment U.S.
inventories by the last-in, first-out or LIFO inventory method. The value of
U.S. inventories determined by that method amounted to $127.0 million and
$139.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If the
Company had used the first-in, first-out or FIFO inventory method, which
approximates replacement value, for these inventories, the balances would have
been $48.7 million and $35.6 million higher at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Due to the application of SAB 108
on January 1, 2006, the Company recorded a pre-tax adjustment to
inventories.

Note 8 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,957.1 million and
$1,908.8 million, respectively. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. The Company completed its
annual testing for impairment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 during the fourth quarter
of each year and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a
reporting unit basis in any of the periods. See Note 3, “Business Segment
Information,” for the allocation of goodwill by business segment.


Identifiable
Intangible Assets

As of
December 31, 2006 and 2005

, the Company had identifiable intangible
assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of
$53.9 million and $59.4 million, respectively, less accumulated
amortization of $37.0 million and $47.9 million, respectively. These
identifiable intangible assets are included in other assets and are considered
immaterial to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of
identifiable intangible assets was approximately $5.0 million for 2006.
Assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible
assets from the value at December 31, 2006, the estimated amortization for
future years is as follows:

2007—$4.0 million;
2008—$3.1 million; 2009—$2.2 million; 2010—$1.2 million; and
2011—$1.1 million. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no
identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite useful
lives as defined by SFAS No. 142.

Revolving Credit
Facilities

The
Credit Facility—

The

Company has not borrowed under
its $500.0 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility
since its inception in July 2005. This facility contains a provision under
which the Company may request, prior to each of the first and second
anniversaries of the facility, a one-year extension of the termination of the
facility. The Company requested an extension effective on the first
anniversary, July 26, 2006, and lenders with commitments for $457.0
million under the facility consented to the extension. Accordingly, on July 26,
2006 this extension became effective, as a result of which $43.0 million
of the facility will terminate on July 26, 2010 and $457.0 million of the
facility will terminate on July 26, 2011.

The credit facility is available for general corporate
purposes including the payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash
payment, plus accrued interest (which was $123.5 million at December 31,
2006), required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of
reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy. The
Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the credit facility from time to
time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the credit facility.
Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the total amounts
available under the credit facility. The credit facility provides for changes
in facility fees based on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt
ratings.

The Company’s obligations under the credit facility
bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the
applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the
relevant currency and time period. The credit facility provides for changes in
borrowing margins based on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt
ratings.

The terms include a requirement that, upon the
occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement
agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially increase the
Company’s liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos
liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required
to repay any amounts outstanding under the credit facility, or refinance the
facility, within 60 days. See Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies”
under the captions “Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs” and “Cryovac
Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction” for further
discussion.

ANZ
Facility—

The

Company has an Australian
dollar 170.0 million, dual-currency revolving credit facility, known as
the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $132.9 million at December 31,
2006, due March 2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to
a group of the Company’s Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general
corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness.
The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to
time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility.

The Company borrowed under the ANZ facility during the
second quarter of 2006, but it repaid those amounts in full and did not borrow
further under the ANZ facility during 2006. There were no amounts outstanding
under this facility at December 31, 2006 or at December 31, 2005.

The Company’s obligations
under the ANZ facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally
determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The ANZ facility
provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company’s long-term senior
unsecured debt ratings.


Other Lines of
Credit

Substantially all the
Company’s short-term borrowings of $20.2 million and $21.8 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were outstanding under lines of
credit available to several of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The weighted
average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 12.5% and 12.3%
at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amounts available under these
credit lines as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately
$198.0 million and $200.1 million, respectively, of which
approximately $177.8 million and $178.3 million, respectively, were
unused.

3% Convertible
Senior Notes

In July 2003, the Company issued 3% convertible
senior notes that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule 144A
and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933.

Upon issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, the
holders had the right to convert those notes into shares of the Company’s
common stock at a conversion rate of 14.2857 shares per $1,000 principal amount
of the notes, which was equivalent to a conversion price of $70.00 per share,
subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June 30,
2033. In accordance with the
anti-dilution provisions of the indenture governing the 3% convertible
senior notes, as a result of the
payment of quarterly dividends on the Company’s common stock, in December 2006 the conversion rate was
adjusted to 14.4437 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $69.23 per share. Holders may
convert their convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during
any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeds
120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; (2) during
any period in which (i) the long-term credit rating assigned to the notes
by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill
Companies, or Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. is lower than BB+ or Ba2,
respectively, (ii) either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s no longer
rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or (iii) the
notes are not assigned a rating by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s;
(3) during the five business day period immediately after any five
consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of
the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate; (4) if
the notes have been called for redemption; or (5) upon the occurrence of
specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for
conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since their issuance.

The Company has the option to redeem the 3%
convertible senior notes beginning July 2, 2007 at a price equal to
101.286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to 100% of
their aggregate principal amount on June 30, 2010.

The holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have
the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes
on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, or upon the

occurrence of a fundamental change in or a
termination of trading of the Company’s common stock, at a price equal to 100%
of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In connection with the
issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September 5, 2003 the
Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares
of the Company’s common stock issuable, subject to anti-dilution adjustments,
upon conversion of the notes. The registration statement became effective on January 23,
2004. None of the notes have been converted and consequently none of those
shares were issued or sold. The Company’s obligation to keep the registration
statement effective has expired. As permitted under the registration rights
agreement between the Company and the initial purchasers of the notes, the
Company was permitted to terminate the registration statement. On September 2,
2005, the Company filed a post-effective amendment to the registration
statement deregistering the shares.


Debt Redemption and
Repurchases

2004 Debt
Redemption

On November 26, 2004,
the Company used net cash of $211.8 million to redeem the entire
outstanding aggregate principal amount, $177.5 million, of its 8.75%
senior notes due July 1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the
8.75% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150 million. The
Company issued the senior notes on June 26, 2001 under Rule 144A and
Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the
redemption price in accordance with the indenture governing the notes. The net
cash used of $211.8 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior
notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $213.4 million and cash
received of $1.6 million related to the termination of the interest rate
swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a
premium to the face amount of the notes, which resulted in a loss of
$29.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations
as “Loss on debt redemption and repurchases.” The annual interest expense on
the redeemed notes was approximately $15.5 million without giving effect
to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the
senior notes.

2004 Debt
Repurchases

In November and December 2004,
the Company used available cash of $25.2 million to repurchase in the open
market $22.7 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009
which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed
these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a
loss of $2.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of
operations as “Loss on debt redemption and repurchases.”

Covenants

Each issue of the Company’s
outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on the Company’s operations and
those of specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale
and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The
credit facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage,
debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on the creation of liens,
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations,
asset sales, and amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed
above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage,
interest coverage and tangible net worth and restrictions on the creation of
liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case
relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are
borrowers under the facility. The Company was in compliance with the above
financial covenants and limitations, as applicable, at

December 31, 2006 and 2005

.

Note 11
Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company reports all derivative instruments on the
balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes.

The Company is exposed to
market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, the Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to
time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative
instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge accounting. The
changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole
corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying
exposures being hedged. The Company assesses the initial and ongoing
effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented
policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. The Company’s practice is to terminate
derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold
or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying forecasted
transaction is no longer probable of occurring.

Foreign Currency
Forward Contracts

The Company is exposed to market risk, such as
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s subsidiaries
have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in currencies
other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company’s
foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value
associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated
in foreign currencies.

At December 31, 2006
and 2005, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts with an
aggregate notional amount of $331.0 million maturing through June 2007
and $309.3 million, which matured through September 2006,
respectively. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the
estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the
event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign
exchange rates, was a net receivable of $0.1 million at December 31, 2006
and $0.6 million at December 31, 2005. These contracts qualified and
were designated as cash flow hedges and had original maturities of less than
twelve months.


Interest Rate Swaps

From time to time, the Company may use interest rate
swaps to manage its mix of fixed and floating rates on its outstanding
indebtedness.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding
interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300.0 million that
qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. The Company entered into
these interest rate swaps to effectively convert its 5.375% senior notes due April 2008
into floating rate debt. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
recorded a mark to market adjustment to record a decrease of $8.9 million and
$12.5 million, respectively, in the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due April 2008
due to changes in interest rates and an offsetting increase to other
liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There
was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the
period.

In 2006 and 2005, under
the terms of the $300.0 million outstanding interest rate swap agreements,
the Company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable
rates that were based on six-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or
LIBOR. As a result, interest expense increased by $6.6 million and $1.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Other Derivative
Instruments

The Company may use other
derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to
manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency
swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These
instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust
interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for
borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap
agreements outstanding.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company records gains and losses on derivatives
qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss), to the
extent that these hedges are effective and until it recognizes the underlying
transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in
the consolidated statement of operations.

Other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 reflected net unrealized after tax losses of $0.7 million
($1.1 million pre-tax), $0.8 million ($1.2 million pre-tax) and $0.4 million
($0.8 million pre-tax), respectively.

The estimated net amount
of the existing unrecognized net gain on derivative instruments that the
Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations
within the next twelve months is $1.0 million, pre-tax. The unrealized amounts
in other comprehensive income (loss) will fluctuate based on changes in the
fair value of open contracts during each reporting period. The Company’s cash
flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were effective
hedges, meaning that they qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Note 12 Financial
Instruments

Under U.S. GAAP, the Company must disclose its
estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments, including those
recorded as assets or liabilities in its consolidated financial statements and
derivative financial instruments.


The carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The fair value of the Company’s senior notes in 2006
and 2005 and the euro notes in 2005, are based on quoted market prices. The
Company derived the fair value estimates of the Company’s various other debt
instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering
prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar
debt offered at the balance sheet date. These estimates are subjective and
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore the
Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the Company’s estimates.

The fair value of the debt in the table below differs
from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on market
conditions as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Generally, the fair value of
fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
rates rise.

The fair values of the Company’s various derivative
instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the
estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
contracts at the reporting date.

The carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at December 31,
2006 and 2005 were as follows:

Credit and Market
Risk

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose
the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk
related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. The Company manages
its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit
standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk.

The Company does not expect any of its counterparties
in derivative transactions to fail to perform as they are substantial
investment and commercial banks with high credit ratings and financial strength
and


have significant
experience using such derivative instruments. Nevertheless, there is a risk
that the Company’s exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could
be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their
obligations.

The Company monitors the impact of market risk on the
fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates
and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging
activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for
trading or other speculative purposes and does not use leveraged derivative
financial instruments.

The Company continually
monitors the creditworthiness of its diverse base of customers to which it
grants credit terms in the normal course of business and generally does not
require collateral. The Company considers the concentrations of credit risk
associated with its trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and
believes that such concentrations do not leave it vulnerable to significant
risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of the
Company’s credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk
with any single customer. The Company’s sales are not materially dependent on a
single customer or a small group of customers.

Note 13 Global
Manufacturing Strategy, Restructuring and Other Charges

Global Manufacturing Strategy

The Company’s global manufacturing strategy, when
implemented, will expand production in countries where demand for the Company’s
products and services has been growing significantly. At the same time, the
Company intends to realign certain manufacturing capacity in North America and
Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi-year program are to
expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Company’s operating
efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company
expects this program, combined with the Company’s supply chain initiative, to
produce meaningful savings in future years. By taking advantage of new
technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects
to continue to enhance its profitable growth and its global leadership
position.

In
July 2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi-year global
manufacturing strategy. The financial scope of this phase is expected to be as
follows:

Expected Range

Capital
  Expenditures

$

130.0–150.0

$

14.2

Associated Costs

$

90.0–100.0

$

15.6

The associated costs include such items as equipment
relocation, facility start-up and severance. The Company expects the capital
expenditures and charges for associated costs to occur between 2007 and 2008,
although the actual timing of these expenditures is subject to change due to a
variety of factors.

During
2006, all charges for the associated costs related to the food packaging
segment and consisted of the following:

operations on the following line items:

$

11.8

3.8

Total

$

15.6

The Company has accrued $11.6 million in severance
costs in connection with this strategy. These costs will be future cash
expenditures that will be incurred for one-time termination benefits. At the
time the severance was accrued, the Company expected to eliminate 242 full-time
positions. Since that time, the Company revised the number of positions to be
eliminated to 245. During 2006, 36 positions were eliminated and the remaining
positions are expected to be eliminated in 2007. The Company expects these
benefits will be paid out before the end of 2009. The Company expects to add
approximately 120 full-time employees at other facilities as production is
transferred, so the net reduction in positions is expected to be 125. The
Company reflected the $11.6 million of severance costs in its consolidated
statement of operations for 2006 in restructuring charges.

The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through
December 31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31,
2006 were as follows:

The Company expects to pay $5.7

amount is reflected in other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2006. The remaining accrual of $5.2 million is
expected to be paid in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in other liabilities on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006.

Other 2006 Restructuring Activities

During 2006, the Company accrued severance costs of
$0.6 million related to the Company’s consolidation of its food packaging
customer service activities in Canada. Such amount was reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations on the restructuring charges line. The
Company expects to eliminate 9 full-time positions. No cash payments were made
during 2006 related to this accrual. The accrual balance at December 31,
2006 was $0.6 million which was reflected in other current liabilities on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

2004 Restructuring Program

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic
regions in order to complement the Company’s long-term growth programs and
financial goals, improve the Company’s operating efficiencies and lower its
overall cost structure. The plans principally reduced the number of employees
and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the Company’s reportable
business segments.

At December 31, 2004, the Company expected to
eliminate 473 full-time positions, which was increased to 475 during 2005. As
an element of the program, the Company expected to add approximately 100
positions in connection with the Company’s realignment or relocation of some of
its manufacturing activities, so that the net reduction in positions was
approximately 375. These actions affected principally


production workers and
members of the Company’s sales force, primarily in Europe. The Company has completed
its reduction in headcount related to its 2004 restructuring program.

The
charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of the following:

The long-lived asset
impairment of $10.3 million consisted of write-downs and write-offs
of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to rationalize
and realign production of some of the Company’s smaller product lines and to
close several smaller European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted
cash flows associated with these asset groups, including estimated salvage
value, were less than the carrying values of these asset groups, they were
written down to their estimated fair value. The Company disposed of these
facilities and much of the equipment during the first six months of 2006.

The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through
December 31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31,
2006 were as follows:

and $0.1 million in 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
recorded in its consolidated statement of operations an additional
restructuring charge of $0.6 million which was related to the 2004
program. This amount includes additional costs related to the relocation of
employees and assets from closed facilities which were completed in 2006. The
Company also recorded in its consolidated statement of operations a net credit
of $0.1 million related to employee termination costs that were accrued as part
of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded
amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated employees of
$0.1 million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being
eligible for the termination benefits of $0.2 million.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $1.7 million of additional
charges related to the 2004 restructuring program. This amount includes
$1.3 million of costs incurred in 2005


related
to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that were closed as
part of the restructuring program. The Company also recorded a net charge of
$0.4 million related to the employee termination costs that were accrued
as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally
recorded amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated
employees of $0.9 million and reductions based upon certain employees no
longer being eligible for the termination benefits of $0.5 million.

Note 14
Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs

Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans

The Company has a
non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees.
Contributions to this plan, which are made at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or in a
combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also
maintains a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most of
its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and
retirement savings plan generally provides for Company contributions based upon
the amount contributed to the plan by the participants. Company contributions
to or provisions for its profit-sharing plan and thrift and retirement
savings plan are charged to operations and amounted to $30.4 million,
$30.0 million and $27.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In
2006, 2005 and 2004 there were no shares of common stock issued for the Company’s
contribution to its profit-sharing plan.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

As required, the Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”),
as of December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires, among other things,
the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan. Each
over funded plan is recognized as an asset and each under funded plan is
recognized as a liability. The initial impact of the standard due to
unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial gains or losses as well as
subsequent changes in the funded status is recognized as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in the line item unamortized pension
liability which is included in total shareholders’ equity. The amount of
unamortized pension liability is recorded net of tax. Additional minimum
pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon
adoption of the new standard. The measurement date used by the Company to
determine the benefit obligations and the plan assets is December 31. In
accordance with SFAS No. 158, the Company’s 2005 accounting and related
disclosures were not affected by the adoption of the new standard. The table
below summarizes the incremental effects of SFAS No. 158 adoption on the
individual line items in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31,

The Company reviews the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets annually, taking into consideration the Company’s asset
allocation, historical returns, and the current economic environment.

The Company’s long-term objectives for plan
investments are to ensure that (a) there is an adequate level of assets to
support benefit obligations to participants over the life of the plans, (b) there
is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations,
and (c) there is a high level of investment return consistent with a
prudent level of investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a
long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with
short-term volatility less than that of a pure equity strategy. To accomplish
this objective, the Company causes assets to be invested in a balanced and
diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. The target asset
allocation will typically be 50-65% in equity securities, with a maximum
equity allocation of 75%, and 35-50% in fixed income securities, with a
minimum fixed income allocation of 25% including cash.

The Company reviews the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets annually, taking into consideration the Company’s asset
allocation, historical returns, and the current economic environment.

The Company’s long-term objectives for plan
investments are to ensure that (a) there is an adequate level of assets to
support benefit obligations to participants over the life of the plans, (b) there
is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations,
and (c) there is a high level of investment return consistent with a
prudent level of investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a
long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term
volatility less than that of a pure equity strategy. To accomplish this
objective, the Company causes assets to be invested primarily in a diversified
mix of equity and fixed income investments.

Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company generally does not offer its employees
postretirement benefits other than programs that are required by the foreign
countries in which the Company operates. In the U.S., the Company offers a
program that is fully funded by the participating retired employees. These
programs are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


Since March 31, 1998,
the Company has offered to some U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging
business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement
healthcare program. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the accrued benefit
liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $2.5 million and
$2.3 million, respectively. The net periodic postretirement expense and
credit components, together with other remaining postretirement healthcare plan
disclosures under SFAS No. 132, are not material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

Asbestos Settlement
and Related Costs

On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an
agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos
claimants in the bankruptcy case of W. R. Grace & Co., known as Grace,
to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against
the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction
described below. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer
claims, successor liability claims, as well as indemnification claims by
Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies, that had
been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December 3,
2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved
the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. For a description of
the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties
involved, see “Cryovac Transaction” and “Contingencies Related to the Cryovac
Transaction” below.

The Company
recorded a charge of $850.1 million as a result of the asbestos settlement
in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2002. The charge consisted of the following items:

·

a
non-cash charge of $512.5 million covering a cash payment that the Company
will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a plan
of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict
when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this
liability as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 5.5%
annual rate from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has
recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of
operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The accrued interest, which is compounded annually, was $123.5 million and
$90.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

·

a
non-cash charge of $321.5 million representing the fair market value at
the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Company’s
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness
of Grace’s plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary
anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and other events affecting the Company’s common stock. The fair
market value of the Company’s common stock was $35.72 per share as of the close
of business on December 5, 2002.


The Company recorded this
amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002 as follows:
$0.9 million representing the aggregate par value of these shares in
common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the
remaining $320.6 million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair
market value over the aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional
paid-in capital. The December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 diluted earnings per
common share calculations reflect the shares of common stock reserved for
issuance related to the asbestos settlement.

·

$16.1 million
of legal and related fees as of December 31, 2002.

Asbestos settlement and
related costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflected legal and related fees for
asbestos-related matters of $1.6 million, $2.2 million and
$2.0 million, respectively.

Cryovac Transaction

On March 31, 1998,
the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac
packaging business and the former Sealed Air Corporation’s business under the
common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of
the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that
transaction, the parties separated the Cryovac packaging business, which
previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the
Company, from the remaining businesses previously held by the Company. The
parties then arranged for the contribution of these remaining businesses to a
company now known as W. R. Grace & Co., and the Company distributed
the Grace shares to the Company’s stockholders. As a result, W. R. Grace &
Co. became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its
outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new
convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into the
former Sealed Air Corporation, which became a subsidiary of the Company and
changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation (US).

Contingencies
Related to the Cryovac Transaction

In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and
its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations
before the Cryovac transaction, whether accruing or occurring before or after
the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to
Cryovac’s operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold
by Grace’s subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary
U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn., which has operated
for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction.
The Cryovac transaction agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to
hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities
retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related
liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company.

Since the beginning of 2000, the Company has been
served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac
transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of
Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in
some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions
and a number of personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for
personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring,
environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product. Neither
the former Sealed Air Corporation nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the
asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None
of these cases has reached resolution through judgment, settlement or
otherwise. As discussed below, Grace’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding has
stayed all these cases.


While the allegations in
these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege
that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction
was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory
of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its
subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for liabilities that arose
with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R.
Grace & Co.—Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a
fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent
value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the
transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets
constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it
would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also
be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors.
If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be
fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required to return the property or
its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace
or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos
claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently
signed a settlement agreement, described below, that is expected to resolve all
these claims.

In the Joint Proxy Statement
furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac
transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief
that Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be
adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the
transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction would be a
fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac transaction
complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant
legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the Company, these
determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

On April 2, 2001,
Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a
sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999.

In connection with its
Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking
to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its
subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order
dated May 3, 2001, which was modified on January 22, 2002, under
which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the
Company and, upon filing and service on the Company, all future asbestos
actions. No further proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions
that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court.

Committees appointed to
represent asbestos claimants in Grace’s bankruptcy case received the court’s
permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company
and its subsidiary Cryovac, Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed
below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between
Fresenius and W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with
the Company. In March 2002, the court ordered that the issues of the
solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction and whether Grace received
reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf
of all of Grace’s creditors. This proceeding was brought in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware (Adv. No. 02-02210).

In June 2002, the
court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the
fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue
allegations that environmental remediation expenses were underestimated or
omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac
transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted that the Cryovac
transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July 2002,
the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the
trial, holding, among other things, that, subject to specified limitations,
post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace.
The Company believes that only


claims
and liabilities that were known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time
of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable
standard.

With the fraudulent
transfer trial set to commence on December 9, 2002, on November 27,
2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees
prosecuting the claims against the Company and Cryovac, Inc., to resolve
all current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac
transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order confirming that the
parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties
and that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the
parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the
agreement in principle calls for payment of nine million shares of the Company’s
common stock and $512.5 million in cash, plus interest on the cash payment
at a 5.5% annual rate starting on December 21, 2002 and ending on the
effective date of the Grace plan of reorganization, when the Company is
required to make the payment. These shares are subject to customary
anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and other events affecting the Company’s common stock. On December 3,
2002, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The
Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement
in principle as of December 5, 2002. The parties subsequently signed a
definitive settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent with
the terms of the agreement in principle. On November 26, 2003, the parties
jointly presented the definitive settlement agreement to the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware for approval. On Grace’s motion to the U.S.
District Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the settlement
agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition.

On June 27, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement.
Although Grace is not a party to the settlement agreement, under the terms of
the order, Grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to
limited exceptions. The order also provides that the Court will retain
jurisdiction of any dispute involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
terms and provisions of the definitive settlement agreement. The Company
expects that the settlement agreement will become effective upon Grace’s
emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with
the terms of the settlement agreement.

On June 8, 2004, the
Company filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware, where the fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the
court vacate the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be
applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. The
Company was not challenging the definitive settlement agreement. The motion was
filed as a protective measure in the event that the settlement agreement is
ultimately not approved or implemented; however, the Company still expects that
the settlement agreement will become effective upon the court’s approval and
Grace’s emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is
consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement.

On July 11, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order closing the proceeding brought in 2002 by the
committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the Grace bankruptcy
proceeding against the Company without prejudice to the Company’s right to
reopen the matter and renew in its sole discretion its prior motion to vacate
the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied relating
to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company.

As a condition to the
Company’s obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, Grace’s
plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement,
including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to below and for an
injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against
the Company and its affiliates. In that case, the settlement will provide that,
upon the effective date of Grace’s plan of reorganization and payment of the
shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against
the Company and its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of
Grace and its affiliates (including former affiliates that became affiliates of
the Company through the Cryovac transaction) will be channeled to and become
the responsibility of one or more trusts to be


established
under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace’s plan
of reorganization. The settlement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer
claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac
transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement
will provide that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all
those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek
indemnity from Grace for the Company’s payments required by the settlement. The
order approving the settlement agreement also provides that the stay of
proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the
effective date of Grace’s plan of reorganization, after which, upon implementation
of the settlement agreement, the Company will be released from the liabilities
asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the
Company will be enjoined.

In January 2005,
Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization and related documents with the
Bankruptcy Court. There were a number of objections filed, and the Company does
not know whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the
settlement agreement or if the other conditions to the Company’s obligation to
pay the settlement amount will be met. If these conditions are not satisfied or
not waived by the Company, the Company will not be obligated to pay the
settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount,
the Company and its affiliates will not be released from the various asbestos-related,
fraudulent transfer, successor liability claims, and indemnification claims
made against them, and all of these claims would remain pending and would have
to be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on alternative
settlement terms or trials. In that case, the Company could face liabilities
that are significantly different from its obligations under the settlement
agreement. The Company cannot estimate at this time what those differences or
their magnitude may be. In the event these liabilities are materially larger
than the current existing obligations, they could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The
Company cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become
effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the
settlement agreement.

In January 2002, the
Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care
Holdings, Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified
affiliates in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract
dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company
was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities that they might incur as a
result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties’
contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and
W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius
transaction. In February 2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they
had accrued a charge of $172.0 million for these potential liabilities,
which included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of
defense of litigation arising from Grace’s Chapter 11 filing. The Company
believed that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under
the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the
Fresenius parties’ claims. In April 2002, the Fresenius parties filed a
motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor.
The Company opposed the motion, and in July 2003, the court denied the
motion without prejudice in view of the November 27, 2002 agreement in
principle referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement,
there will be mutual releases exchanged between the Fresenius parties and the
Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction.

In November 2004, the
Company’s Canadian subsidiary Sealed Air (Canada) Co./Cie learned that it had
been named a defendant in the case of

Thundersky
v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al.

(File No. CI04-01-39818),
which is pending in the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench. Grace and W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn.
are also named as defendants. The claim is brought as a putative class
proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian
resident, other than in the course of employment, as a result of Grace’s
marketing, selling, processing, manufacturing, distributing and/or delivering
asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada prior to the Cryovac
Transaction. Another proceeding was filed in January 2005 in the Manitoba
Court of The Queen’s Bench naming the


Company
and specified subsidiaries as defendants. The latter proceeding,

Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of
Manitoba v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al.

(File No. CI05-01-41069),
seeks the recovery of the cost of insured health services allegedly provided by
the Government of Manitoba to the members of the class of plaintiffs in the

Thundersky

proceeding. In October 2005,
the Company learned that six additional putative class proceedings had been
brought in various provincial and federal courts in Canada seeking recovery
from the Company and its subsidiaries Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air
(Canada) Co./Cie, as well as other defendants including W. R. Grace &
Co. and W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn., for alleged injuries suffered by any
Canadian resident, other than in the course of employment (except with respect
to one of these six claims), as a result of Grace’s marketing, selling,
manufacturing, processing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing
products in Canada prior to the Cryovac Transaction. Grace and W. R. Grace &
Co.—Conn. have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its affiliates in respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees
and costs, in these actions. In April 2001, Grace Canada, Inc. had
obtained an order of the Superior Court of Justice, Commercial List, Toronto,
recognizing the Chapter 11 actions in the United States of America involving
Grace Canada, Inc.’s U.S. parent corporation and other affiliates of Grace
Canada, Inc., and enjoining all new actions and staying all current
proceedings against Grace Canada, Inc. related to asbestos under the

Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act.

That
order has been renewed repeatedly. In November 2005, upon motion by Grace
Canada, Inc., the court ordered an extension of the injunction and stay to
actions involving asbestos against the Company and its Canadian affiliate and
the Attorney General of Canada, which had the effect of staying all of the
Canadian actions referred to above. The stay has been extended through April 1,
2007, and the Company expects the stay to be further extended. Grace’s proposed
plan of reorganization provides that these claims will be paid by the trusts to
be established under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code as part of
Grace’s plan of reorganization, and it is anticipated that the defendants will
ask the Canadian courts to enforce the terms of the plan of reorganization.
However, if Grace’s final plan does not include comparable provisions or if the
Canadian courts refuse to enforce Grace’s final plan of reorganization in the
Canadian courts, and if in addition Grace is unwilling or unable to defend and
indemnify the Company and its subsidiaries in these cases, then the Company
could be required to pay substantial damages, which the Company cannot estimate
at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations.

In view of Grace’s Chapter
11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company
is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac
transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no
material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the
Company.

Final determinations and accountings
under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to
the transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace’s Chapter 11 filing
in 2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect
the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its
affiliates agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by Grace and
its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to
be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the Company is
responsible for specified amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any
amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the
liabilities of Grace and its affiliates to the Company. The Company intends to
seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to
asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims, and
approximately $8.1 million paid by the Company on account of its guaranty
of debt issued by W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn. Except to the extent of any
potential setoff or similar claim, the Company expects that its claims will be
as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Company’s claims
against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated, the Company
cannot determine the amount of the Company’s claims, the extent to which these
claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the
amount of the Company’s recovery on these claims, if any, in the bankruptcy
proceeding.


On September 15,
2003, the case of

Senn v. Hickey, et al.

(Case No. 03-CV-4372) was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the District of New Jersey (Newark). This lawsuit seeks class action status on
behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the
Company during the period from March 27, 2000 through July 30, 2002.
The lawsuit names the Company and five current and former officers and
directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is required to provide
indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Company’s counsel
is also defending them. On June 29, 2004, the court granted plaintiff
Miles Senn’s motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of his
choice of lead counsel. The plaintiff’s amended complaint makes a number of
allegations against the defendants. The principal allegations are that during
the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public,
artificially inflated the price of the Company’s common stock by publicly
issuing false and misleading statements and violated U.S. GAAP by failing to
properly account and accrue for the Company’s contingent liability for asbestos
claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory
damages and other relief. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit,
since the Company believes that it properly disclosed its contingent liability
for Grace’s asbestos claims and properly accounted for its contingent liability
for such claims under U.S. GAAP.

On March 14, 2005,
the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint in the

Senn v. Hickey, et al.

case for failure to state a claim. On December 19, 2005, the Court granted
in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court determined
that the Complaint failed adequately to allege scienter as to the four
individual defendants other than T.J. Dermot Dunphy, and therefore dismissed
the lawsuit with respect to these four individual defendants, but adequately
alleged scienter as to Mr. Dunphy and the Company. Mr. Dunphy is a
current director of the Company and was formerly Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On December 28, 2005, the
defendants requested that the Court reconsider the portion of the December 19,
2005 order denying defendants’ motion to dismiss with regard to the Company’s
arguments other than scienter, or, in the alternative, that the Court certify
the matter for interlocutory appeal. On February 13, 2006, the defendants
filed an answer to the amended complaint. On April 7, 2006, the Court
heard oral argument on defendants’ reconsideration motion, and on July 10,
2006, the Court denied the motion on the ground that issues of fact prevent the
Court from granting a motion to dismiss based on the Company’s arguments other
than scienter. On October 3, 2006, plaintiff filed a motion to certify a
class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of the
Company during the period from March 27, 2000 through July 30, 2002.
On November 22, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended motion for class
certification, seeking to withdraw as a class representative and the
substitution of a new class representative, the State of Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System. Discovery concerning class certification
and the merits is ongoing. Although the Company believes that neither it nor
Mr. Dunphy should have any liability in this lawsuit, until the lawsuit
has progressed beyond its current, still preliminary, stage, the Company cannot
estimate the potential cost of an unfavorable outcome, if any.

Compliance Matters

In late 2005, the Company
identified travel and related expenses that had been paid by some of the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries for trips by government officials who oversee
the regulation of the Company’s medical products in a foreign country. Although
these expenses were accurately recorded as travel and entertainment expenses in
the Company’s books and records, these activities appeared to have breached the
Company’s Code of Conduct. More importantly, the Company was concerned that
these payments may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and
therefore outside counsel was retained and promptly began an internal
investigation. In March 2006, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the
United States Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the factual information
obtained to date in the Company’s internal investigation, including that these
payments were made between 2003 and 2005 and totaled less than
$0.2 million. The internal investigation is ongoing, and the Company is cooperating
with the DOJ and the SEC. The


Company
cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or the terms upon which this
matter will be resolved, although the Company currently does not expect this
matter to be material to its consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. In connection with the investigation, the Company is
evaluating remedial measures and has taken or will take timely and appropriate
action where necessary.

Leases

The Company is obligated
under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office
facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller manufacturing sites
that it occupies. The Company accounts for the majority of its leases as
operating leases, which may include purchase or renewal options. Net rental
expense was $28.5 million, $28.3 million and $28.2 million for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments
under noncancelable real and personal property leases are as follows: 2007—$25.6 million;
2008—$19.4 million; 2009—$11.9 million; 2010—$10.0 million; 2011—$9.4 million;
and subsequent years—$27.3 million.

Long-Term Commitments

At
December 31, 2006, the Company has principal contractual obligations which include
agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials,
or services in the normal course of business aggregating to approximately
$168.5 million. The estimated future cash outlays are as follows: 2007

—

$79.4 million; 2008

—

$53.4 million; 2009

—

$11.9 million; 2010

—

$11.9 million; 2011

—

$6.4 million; and subsequent years

—

$5.5 million.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to
loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it
accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation
efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be
reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting
for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible
that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of
operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are
reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts
and their costs can be better estimated.

The Company evaluates
these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the
progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of
discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of
remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible
parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject
to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably
estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company
believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of
operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has adequately
reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the FASB, issued
SFAS No. 123 (revised), “Share-Based Payment” which replaces SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” SFAS No. 123 (revised) covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements and requires that the compensation cost related to
these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost
is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised) in the first
quarter of 2006 as required using the modified prospective application. Under
the modified prospective application, SFAS No. 123 (revised) applies to
all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled by the Company since January 1,
2006 and to unvested awards at the date of adoption. The Company was also
required to eliminate any unearned or deferred compensation related to earlier
awards against the appropriate equity account. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had $17.8 million of deferred compensation recorded in the
shareholders’ equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. This
amount was eliminated against additional paid-in capital on January 1,
2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised) did not have a material
impact on the consolidated statement of operations as the amounts previously
recognized by the Company for stock awards under the 1998 and 2005 Contingent
Stock Plans are essentially the same as under SFAS No. 123.

Contingent Stock Plans

At the Company’s annual
meeting of the stockholders held on May 20, 2005, the stockholders
approved the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation. The 2005
Contingent Stock Plan replaced the contingent stock plan that was approved by
the Company’s stockholders in 1998. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan is the
Company’s sole long-term equity compensation program for officers and
employees, except that prior grants under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan remain
subject to that plan’s provisions. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan provides for
awards of equity-based compensation, including restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance share units and cash awards measured by
share price, to executive officers and other key employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries, as well as U.S.-based key consultants to the Company.
During 2006, under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the Company has


granted
restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards. An employee or
consultant selected by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the
Company’s Board of Directors to receive an award may accept the award during
the 60-day period beginning when written notice of the award has been
sent to the participant, provided the participant’s relationship to the Company
has not changed.

The Company’s 1998
Contingent Stock Plan provided for the grant to employees of awards to purchase
common stock during the succeeding 60-day period. The Organization and
Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors had set the price to
purchase the common stock pursuant to the grants under the 1998 Contingent
Stock Plan at $1.00 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments in the event
of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, or other events
affecting the Company’s common stock. There is no similar purchase price under
the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan.

Awards made under the 2005
Contingent Stock Plan and shares issued under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan
are restricted as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three
years after award. In the event of termination of employment of a participant
prior to lapse of the restriction, the awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock
Plan are forfeited on the date of termination unless (i) the termination
results from the participant’s death or permanent and total disability, or (ii) the
Organization and Compensation Committee affirmatively determines not to seek
forfeiture of the award in whole or in part. Likewise, shares of restricted
stock awarded under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan are subject to a repurchase
option by the Company at the price at which the shares were issued. The forfeiture
provision of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and the repurchase provision of the
1998 Contingent Stock Plan expire upon vesting of the awards, except that these
provisions lapse sooner if specified events occur that affect the existence or
control of the Company.

For restricted stock
awards, the Company records compensation expense and credits additional paid-in
capital within shareholders’ equity based on the fair value of the award at the
grant date. For restricted stock unit awards, the Company records compensation
expense and credits additional paid-in capital within shareholders’ equity
based on the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period. The
amount of the deferred compensation related to the restricted stock unit awards
is re-measured at each reporting period based on the then current stock price
and the effects of the stock price changes are recognized as compensation
expense. For cash awards, the Company records a liability, which is reflected
in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and records
compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the end of each
reporting period. The amount of the liability is re-measured at each reporting
period based on the then current stock price and the effects of the stock price
changes are recognized as compensation expense. At December 31, 2006, the
liability related to cash awards was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. The Company has not settled any cash awards during 2006.

Compensation expense
related to restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards is
recognized, net of estimated forfeitures in 2006 under SFAS No. 123
(revised) and net of actual forfeitures in 2005 and 2004 under SFAS No. 123,
over a three-year period on a straight-line basis.

These charges are included in marketing, administrative and development
expenses and amounted to $14.0 million and $11.9 million and $10.2 million
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

At December 31, 2006,
the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding restricted
stock, restricted stock units and cash awards was approximately 1.6 years, 2.2
years, and 2.2 years, respectively, and had terms expiring up to 2009. The
total compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock, restricted stock
units and cash awards not yet recognized was $25.3 million as of December 31,
2006. At December 31, 2006, there were 722,975 shares of nonvested
restricted stock, 93,900 shares of nonvested restricted stock units and
nonvested cash awards measured by 3,000 shares outstanding. The 2005 Contingent
Stock Plan and the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan permit tax withholding
attributable to awards and other charges that may be required by law to be paid
by withholding a portion of the shares attributable to such awards.

Directors Stock Plan

Non-cash compensation comprises shares issued to
non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Company’s 2002 Stock
Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at
the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual
grants of shares to non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to
eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price
per share equal to the par value of the shares, as all or part of the annual or
interim retainer fees for non-employee directors. During 2002, the Company
adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or
part of their annual retainer until the non-employee director retires from the
Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual
retainer payable in shares of stock. If a non-employee director makes this
election, the non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if
any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. Cash dividends on deferred shares
are credited to the non-employee director’s deferred cash account on the
applicable dividend payment date. The Company charges the excess of fair value
over the price at which shares are issued under this plan to operations. This
charge is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and
amounted to $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively

.

Other Common Stock
Issuances

During 2004, the Company
issued 50,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, to a
non-employee under an intellectual property purchase agreement as prepaid
royalties under that agreement. These shares vest ratably over a five-year
period. The Company amortizes the cost associated


with
these shares on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense related to this
issuance was $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Stock Options

Stock option plans in which specified employees of the
Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March 31,
1998 in connection with the Cryovac transaction, except with respect to options
that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been
granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the date of
grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans
in 1998 had fully vested prior to December 31, 2000. Since such options
were fully vested, SFAS No. 123 (revised) is not applicable. Since 1997,
the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in
the future.

At December 31, 2006, these
options had a per share exercise price of $42.19, a weighted-average
remaining contractual life of approximately 3 months, and terms expiring up to March 2007.

During 2006, 2005 and
2004, the holders exercised options to purchase 69,839, 63,696 and 33,136,
respectively, with an aggregate exercise price of $2.9 million,
$2.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. At December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, the cumulative number of options to purchase 50,574,
47,885 and 46,820 shares of common stock, respectively, had expired. At December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, options to purchase 17,233, 89,761 and 154,522 shares of
common stock, respectively, were outstanding at average per share exercise
prices of $42.19, $41.61 and $40.71, respectively.

Cash Dividends

The Company used cash of
$48.6 million during 2006 to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common
share on March 17, June 16, September 15, and December 15,
2006. The payment of these dividends was reflected as a reduction to retained
earnings in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Note 18 Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share were $3.38 for 2006,
$3.09 for 2005 and $2.56 for 2004. Diluted earnings per common share were $2.93
for 2006, $2.69 for 2005 and $2.25 for 2004.

In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the
Company’s calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2006,
2005 and 2004 provides for the conversion of the Company’s 3% convertible
senior notes due June 2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No. 04-08,
“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,”
the assumed issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the
Company’s previously announced asbestos settlement referred to in Note 16
to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Asbestos Settlement
and Related Costs” and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed
treasury stock repurchases.

Note 20 Acquisitions

On January 3, 2006,
the Company acquired Nelipak Holdings B.V. for cash in the amount of
$41.2 million, net of cash acquired, and assumed debt of approximately
$9.6 million. The Company accounted for this acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting, which resulted in an allocation of goodwill of
$25.7 million. The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed using estimated fair values. The Company also made
other smaller acquisitions in 2006. These acquisitions, including the
acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. were not material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.


Note 21 Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108

In September 2006, the SEC released SAB 108. SAB
108 provides guidance on how to evaluate prior period financial statement
misstatements for purposes of assessing their materiality in the current
period. There are two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of
financial statement misstatements: the “rollover” or income statement method
and the “iron curtain” or balance sheet method. Historically, the Company used
the “rollover” method. Under this method, the Company quantified its financial
statement misstatements based on the amount of errors originating in the
current-year income statement, and as result did not consider the effects of
correcting the portion of the current year balance sheet misstatement that
originated in prior years. SAB 108 now requires that the Company must consider
both the rollover and iron curtain methods (“dual method”) when quantifying
misstatements in the financial statements. The iron curtain method quantifies a
misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in
the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the
misstatement’s origination. Upon application, SAB 108 permits the Company to
adjust for the cumulative effect of errors that were previously considered
immaterial under the rollover method that are now considered material under the
dual method. The SAB 108 adjustment affects the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities as of the beginning of the current year, with an offsetting
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2006.

In accordance with SAB
108, the Company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for 2006 for the
items described below. These errors had previously been considered immaterial
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements using the rollover method.

Capitalization of
Overhead in Inventories

The Company adjusted its beginning
retained earnings for 2006 to reflect the capitalization of certain
manufacturing-related overhead costs in inventories. These costs were
previously expensed as incurred for a number of years. As a result of this
adjustment, the Company recorded an increase of $40.6 million to inventory and
a corresponding increase to retained earnings, before income taxes.

General Inventory
Reserve

The Company had maintained
a general inventory reserve on its consolidated balance sheet. This reserve was
established a number of years ago to recognize exposures regarding the
valuation of inventories that the Company believed existed at that time. This
amount was reversed under SAB No. 108, which resulted in an increase to
inventories of $6.0 million and a corresponding increase, before income taxes,
to retained earnings.

Equipment
Depreciation

The Company adjusted its
beginning retained earnings for 2006 for a historical misstatement related to
the use of incorrect useful lives for the depreciation of certain equipment. This
adjustment accumulated over several years and resulted in an increase to
accumulated depreciation of $4.4 million and a corresponding reduction, before
income taxes, to retained earnings.

Tax Valuation
Allowance

The Company adjusted its
beginning retained earnings for 2006 for a historical misstatement related to
income tax valuation allowances that exceeded the net deferred tax assets in
certain jurisdications, which accumulated over a period of several years. These
excess valuation allowances were reversed under SAB No. 108, which
resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets of $3.0 million and a
corresponding increase to retained earnings.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the
disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN No. 48”) “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” The interpretation prescribes a consistent
recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as criteria for
subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax positions for
financial statement purposes. The interpretation also requires expanded
disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. FIN No. 48 is
effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent Events

Two-For-One Stock
Split

On February 16, 2007, the Company’s Board of
Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Company’s common stock, to
be effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend is payable on March 16,
2007 at the rate of one additional share of the Company’s common stock for each
share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding to stockholders of
record at the close of business on March 2, 2007.

This stock split will result in the issuance of
approximately 80.7 million additional shares of common stock and will be
accounted for by the transfer of approximately $8.1 million from additional
paid-in capital to common stock.  In
addition, nine million additional shares of common stock will be reserved
related to the asbestos settlement and will be accounted for by the transfer of
$0.9 from additional paid-in capital to common stock reserved for issuance
related to asbestos settlement.  Shares reserved
for issuance under the Company’s 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the 2002 Directors
Stock Plan and for the conversion of the Company’s 3% convertible senior notes
will also be similarly adjusted.


Pro
forma earnings per share amounts on a post-split basis for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 would be as follows:

2007 Quarterly Cash
Dividend

On February 16, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
also increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.20 per common
share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the pre-split shares of
the Company’s common stock on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the
close of business on March 2, 2007. The estimate of this liability is $16.1
million and was calculated using 80,672,810 shares of common stock that were
issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2006.

Divestitures

On February 9, 2007,
the Company sold its 50 percent interest in PolyMask Corporation to its joint
venture partner, 3M Company. The joint venture was formed in 1991 between the
Company and 3M to produce and sell non-packaging surface protection films. The
Company received an aggregate cash amount of approximately $36.0 million for
the transaction and other related assets and is expecting to record a pre-tax
gain of approximately $35.0 million ($21.0 million after-tax) in the first
quarter of 2007. The Company accounted for this joint venture under the equity
method of accounting. The consolidated statements of operations for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 include $3.9 million, $2.6 million
and $2.7 million, respectively, for the Company’s proportionate share of
PolyMask Corporation’s net income, which is recorded in other income, net. The
Company’s investment in this joint venture was not material to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms and that the Company’s employees accumulate this information and
communicate it to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer (its principal executive officer) and its Chief Financial Officer (its
principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding the required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures under Rule 13a-15. The Company’s management, including the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, supervised and
participated in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

The Company’s management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act. The management of the Company evaluated, with the
participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness, as of the end of its 2006 fiscal year, of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting. The suitable recognized control framework on
which management’s evaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is based is the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as
COSO. Based upon that evaluation under the COSO framework, the Company’s
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of its 2006 fiscal year was effective. The independent registered
public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. KPMG’s attestation report is included below in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sealed Air Corporation:

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Sealed Air Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).” Sealed Air Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).” Also, in our opinion, Sealed Air Corporation maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).”

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, cash flows and
comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,


2006,
and the related consolidated financial statement schedule, and our report dated
February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.
