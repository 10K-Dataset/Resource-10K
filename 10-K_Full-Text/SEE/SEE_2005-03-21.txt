PART I

Item 1.    Business

Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company"), operating through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products.

The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US). These two subsidiaries directly
and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. References herein to the Company include, collectively,
the Company and its subsidiaries, except where the context indicates otherwise.

Segments

The Company operates in two reportable business segments: (i) Food Packaging and (ii) Protective Packaging, described more fully below. Information
concerning the Company's reportable segments appears in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Food Packaging Products

The Company's principal food packaging products are flexible materials, associated packaging equipment systems, rigid containers and absorbent pads. These
products package a broad range of
perishable foods and are marketed globally. The Company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses.

Flexible Materials and Related Systems

The Company produces a variety of high-performance proprietary flexible bags, films and laminates, and associated packaging equipment systems,
marketed and sold primarily under the Cryovac® trademark. Customers use these products to package a broad range of perishable foods such as fresh meat and poultry, smoked and processed
meat, cheese, produce, seafood, baked goods, and processed and prepared foods such as soups, condiments and sauces for restaurants and institutions.

The
Company's principal food packaging materials offerings are bags, films and laminates. The bags and films are co-extruded, multi-layered materials that, when exposed to
heat, mold themselves to the shape of the product. Laminated films are multi-layered, generally non-shrinkable plastic materials used to package perishable foods and shelf-stable products
such as syrups and toppings. The Company generally produces films and bags in barrier and permeable forms, depending on the extent to which customers want oxygen or other gases to pass through the
material. For fresh-cut produce, the Company produces films that permit gases to pass through at various rates, matching the varying respiration rates of different vegetables, thereby
extending shelf life. The Company also offers films, tubing and connectors for use in manufacturing containers and pouches for a wide variety of medical applications. These medical packaging products
are manufactured using technology comparable to that used to manufacture the Company's food packaging products and are similar in form to those products.

The
Company's principal food packaging equipment offerings are rotary chamber vacuum systems, vertical form-fill-seal systems, dispensing equipment, manual and
automated loading units, shrink tunnels, bagging systems and auxiliary equipment. This equipment may be installed to package foods in shrink, vacuum or vacuum skin packages, which can utilize the
Company's films and bags. Form-fill-seal units are used to package foods in pouches, which can be made using the Company's films and laminates. The Company markets systems to
the food processing industry under the Cryovac® trademark and other trademarks. The Company's case ready packaging customers, principally meat and poultry processors, purchase trays and
pads as discussed below, specially designed films, and packaging


equipment
to package consumer cuts of meat and poultry products at a central location prior to shipment to the supermarket. Case ready packages are ready for the meat case upon arrival at the retail
store.

Rigid Packaging and Absorbent Pads

The Company sells foam and solid plastic trays and containers that customers use to package a wide variety of food products. The Company manufactures such
products in its own facilities in various regions or has them fabricated by other manufacturers. Food processors and supermarkets use these products to protect and display fresh meat, poultry, dairy,
produce and other food products. The Company also manufactures and sells absorbent pads used for food packaging, such as its Dri-Loc® absorbent pads.

Protective Packaging Products

The Company's principal protective packaging products provide cushioning, surface protection and void fill. The Company sells its protective packaging products
and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries. The products in this segment enable end users to provide a high degree of protection in packaging their items by means of
cushioning or surface protection, or a combination thereof, as well as void fill.

Cushioning and Surface Protection Products

The Company manufactures and markets Bubble Wrap® and AirCap® air cellular packaging materials, which consist of air encapsulated between
two layers of plastic film, each containing a barrier layer to retard air loss. This material forms a pneumatic cushion to protect products from damage through shock or vibration during shipment. A
recent product offering is the Company's Inflatable Bubble Wrap® packaging system, which provides on-site, on-demand packaging. Another recent innovation is the
Company's PriorityPak™ System, a high-speed product containment and protective packaging solution with advanced sensor technology. Also, the Company sells performance shrink
films under the Cryovac®, Opti® and CorTuff® trademarks for product display and merchandising applications. Customers use these films to "shrink-wrap" a
wide assortment of industrial and consumer products. The Company offers Shanklin® and Opti® shrink packaging systems for these applications. The Company's Instapak®
polyurethane foam packaging systems (which consist of proprietary blends of polyurethane chemicals, high performance polyolefin films and specially designed dispensing equipment) provide protective
packaging for a wide variety of products. The Company generally sells CelluPlank® plank foams and Stratocell® laminated polyethylene foams to fabricators and converters for
packaging and non-packaging applications. The Company also manufactures thin polyethylene foams in roll and sheet form under the trademarks Cell-Aire® and Cellu-
Cushion®. Korrvu® packaging is the Company's suspension and retention packaging offering. In addition, the Company makes insulation products with foil-laminated air
cellular materials.

The
Company manufactures and markets Jiffy® protective mailers and other durable mailers and bags in several standard sizes. The Company's principal protective mailers are
lightweight, tear-resistant mailers marketed under various trademarks, including Jiffylite®, Mail Lite™ and TuffGard®, lined with air cellular
cushioning material, as well as the widely used Jiffy® padded mailers made from recycled kraft paper padded with macerated recycled newspaper. The Company's durable mailers and bags,
composed of multi-layered polyolefin film, are lightweight, water-resistant and puncture-resistant and are available in tamper-evident varieties. The Company markets these mailers and bags under the
ShurTuff®, Trigon®, Lab Pak®, and Keepsafe® trademarks and other brands. The Company also manufactures and sells paper packaging products under the
trademarks Kushion Kraft®, Custom Wrap™, Jiffy Packaging™ and Void Kraft™.


The
Company also offers inflatable packaging systems. Its Fill-Air® inflatable packaging system converts rolls of polyethylene film into continuous perforated
chains of air-filled cushions. The Company's Fill-Air® RF system consists of a compact, portable inflator and self-sealing inflatable plastic bags. The
Company produces and markets converting systems that convert some of the Company's packaging materials, such as air cellular cushioning materials, thin polyethylene foam and paper packaging materials,
into sheets of a pre-selected size and quantity or, for the Company's recycled kraft paper, into paper dunnage material.

Other Products

The Company manufactures and sells a number of other products, such as specialty adhesive tapes, solar collectors and covers for swimming pools, and products
related to the elimination and neutralization of static electricity. The Company also manufactures recycled kraft paper and loose-fill polystyrene packaging.

Foreign Operations

The Company operates in the United States and in 50 other countries, and its products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world.
In maintaining its foreign operations, the Company faces risks inherent in these operations, such as those of currency fluctuations. Information on currency exchange risk appears in Part II,
Item 7A of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Financial information about geographic areas setting forth net sales and total long-lived assets for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004 appears in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Marketing, Distribution and Customers

The Company's global sales and marketing staff numbers approximately 2,600 employees, who sell and market the Company's products to and through a large number of
distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers.

To
support its food packaging customers, the Company operates food science laboratories that assist customers in identifying the appropriate food packaging materials and systems to meet
their needs. The Company also offers customized graphic design services to its customers.

To
assist its marketing efforts for its protective packaging products and to provide specialized customer services, the Company operates packaging laboratories in many of its facilities.
These laboratories are staffed by professional packaging engineers and equipped with drop-testing and other equipment used to develop and test cost-effective package designs to
meet the particular protective packaging requirements of each customer.

The
Company has no material long-term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2004, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the
Company's consolidated net sales.

Although
net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products tend to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be
material to its consolidated business.


Competition

Competition for most of the Company's packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Since competition is also
based upon innovations in packaging technology, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership. There are other companies producing
competing products that are well established and may have greater financial resources than the Company.

There
are other manufacturers of food packaging products, some of which are companies offering similar products that operate on a global basis and others that operate in a region or
single country. Competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic, paper, metals and other materials. The Company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of
flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those products and one of the leading suppliers of absorbent pads for food products to
supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the United States.

The
Company's protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide
protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage. Among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products, expanded plastics, corrugated die cuts,
loosefill packaging materials, strapping, envelopes, reinforced bags, boxes and other containers, and various corrugated materials. The Company's Instapak® packaging and its plank and
laminated foam products also compete with various types of molded foam plastics, fabricated foam plastics, mechanical shock mounts, and wood blocking and bracing systems. The Company believes that it
is one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer, shrink films for industrial and commercial applications, protective mailers, polyethylene foam and
polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which it sells these products.

Raw Materials

The raw materials for the Company's products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers. Some
materials used in the Company's protective packaging products are reprocessed from scrap generated in the Company's manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs.
The principal raw materials used in both of the Company's reportable business segments are polyolefin and other petrochemical-based resins and films, and paper and wood pulp products. The Company also
purchases corrugated materials, cores for rolls of products such as films and Bubble Wrap® cushioning, inks for printed materials, and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam
packaging products. In addition, the Company offers a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment, some of which it manufactures or has manufactured to its specifications, some of which it
assembles and some of which it purchases from other suppliers.

Product Development

The Company maintains a continuing effort to develop new products and to improve its existing products and processes, including developing new packaging and
non-packaging applications for its products. From time to time, the Company also acquires and commercializes new packaging designs or techniques developed by others. The Company has joint
research and development projects combining the technical capabilities of its food packaging operations and its protective packaging operations. The Company spent $73.2 million for
Company-sponsored research and development in 2004, compared with $69.0 million during 2003, and $59.3 million during 2002.


Patents and Trademarks

The Company is the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, trademarks and trademark registrations that relate to
many of its products, manufacturing processes and equipment. The Company believes that its patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. Neither of the Company's reportable
segments, however, is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone. Rather, the Company believes that its success depends primarily on its marketing, engineering and manufacturing skills and on
its ongoing research and development efforts. The Company believes that the expiration or unenforceability of any of its patents, applications, licenses or trademark registrations would not be
material to the Company's business or financial position.

Environmental Matters

As a manufacturer, the Company is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities in which it operates covering the
release of materials to the environment, regarding standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. The
Company reviews environmental laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and believes that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the
Company's capital expenditures or financial position.

In
some jurisdictions in which the Company's packaging products are sold or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate, among other things, recycled
or reprocessed content and sale or disposal of packaging materials. In addition, customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that are viewed as being "environmentally sound" and that
minimize the generation of solid waste. While these issues can be a competitive factor in the marketplace for packaging materials, the Company maintains programs designed to comply with these laws and
regulations, to monitor their evolution, and to meet this customer demand. These issues can be a competitive advantage for the Company given the inherent source reduction benefits of many of its
processes and products. One advantage inherent in many of the Company's products is that thin, lightweight packaging solutions reduce customer waste in comparison to available alternatives.

The
Company also supports its customers' interest in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of the Company's products or product packaging and for
materials used in some of the Company's products. When possible, materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in the Company's protective packaging operations or
offered to other manufacturers for use in other products.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 17,600 employees worldwide. Approximately 8,200 of those employees were in the U.S., with
approximately 490 of those covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 9,400 Company employees who were outside the U.S., approximately 6,700 were covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Outside of the U.S., many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards, as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed. The
Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

The Company makes available, free of charge, on or through
its web site at

, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or


furnished
under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, known as the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files these materials
with, or furnishes them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 2.    Properties

As of December 31, 2004, the Company produced products in 121 manufacturing facilities, with 21 of those facilities serving both its Food Packaging and
Protective Packaging business segments. The Company produced food packaging products in 49 manufacturing facilities, of which 15 were in North America, 15 in the European region, 7 in Latin America,
10 in the Asia Pacific region, and 2 in Africa. The Company produced protective packaging products in 93 manufacturing facilities, of which 39 were in North America, 26 in the European region, 11 in
Latin America, 15 in the Asia Pacific region, and 2 in Africa. The Company occupies other facilities containing sales, distribution, technical, warehouse or administrative functions at a number of
locations in the United States and in various foreign countries.

In
the United States, the Company manufactures food packaging products at facilities in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina and Texas. It manufactures protective packaging products at facilities in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. Because of the light but bulky nature of the Company's air cellular, polyethylene foam and protective mailer products, the Company
realizes significant freight savings by locating manufacturing facilities for these products near its customers and distributors.

The
Company owns the large majority of its manufacturing facilities. Some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements. The Company also leases sites for
warehouse and office needs, as well as for the balance of its manufacturing facilities, which are generally smaller sites. The Company's manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose
buildings that house the Company's specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products. The Company believes that its manufacturing, warehouse and office facilities are well maintained,
suitable for their purposes and adequate for the Company's needs.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

The information set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 19 under the captions "Cryovac
Transaction" and "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" is incorporated herein by reference.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company was a party to, or otherwise involved in, several federal, state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the
cleanup of "Superfund" sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and other sites. The Company may have potential liability for investigation and
cleanup of some of these sites. It is the Company's policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if the Company can reasonably estimate an
amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies, without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the Company
reviews these liabilities periodically and adjusts its reserves as additional information becomes available. At December 31, 2004, environmental related reserves were not material to the
Company's financial condition or results of operations. While it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters, based upon the information
currently available to the Company and its experience in dealing with these matters, the Company believes that its potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to the
Company's consolidated results of operations or consolidated balance sheets.


The
Company is also involved in various other legal actions incidental to its business. The Company believes, after consulting with counsel, that the disposition of these other legal
proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or consolidated balance sheets.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders during the fourth quarter of 2004.

In
November 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against it and its
affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction. The parties signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. In
connection with this settlement, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $850.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations in 2002, which resulted in the Company's net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2002. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Beginning
January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, the Company stopped recording amortization expense related to
goodwill. Goodwill amortization expense was $57.0 million in 2001 and $51.8 million in 2000. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

In
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company incurred restructuring and other charges of $33.0 million relating to global profit improvement initiatives implemented to improve
the Company's operating efficiencies and cost structure. In 2001, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $32.8 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
July 2003, the Company issued a total of $1,281.3 million of senior notes. On July 18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and
additional cash on hand, approximately $1,298.1 million in the aggregate, to redeem its Series A convertible preferred stock at the redemption price of $51.00 per share. See
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(5)

The
Company has retroactively applied EITF Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," which requires that the
dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company's 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033, which were issued in July 2003, be included in dilutive earnings per
common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to convert the debt into shares has been satisfied. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(6)

In
December 2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into a U.S. accounts receivable securitization facility and sold $95.6 million of interests in
U.S. accounts receivable to the financial institutions participating in this facility. This amount was removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding
borrowings. As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, these financial institutions held no interests in accounts receivable under this facility. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

(7)

EBIT
is defined as earnings (loss) before interest expense and provisions for income taxes. EBITDA is defined as EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. EBIT and EBITDA do not
purport to represent net earnings or net cash provided by operating activities, as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles, and should not be considered as an
alternative to such measurements or as indicators of the Company's performance. The Company's definitions of EBIT and EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other
companies. EBIT and EBITDA are among the indicators used by the Company's management to measure the performance of the Company's operations and thus the Company's management believes such information
may be useful to investors. Such measures are also among the criteria upon which performance-based compensation may be based. The following is a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to EBIT and
EBITDA:

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The information in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" should be read together with the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding.

Introduction

The Company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products, operating in the United States and in 50 other countries, with products
distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world.

The
Company operates in two reportable business segments, Food Packaging and Protective Packaging. The Company's principal food packaging products are flexible materials, associated
packaging equipment systems, rigid containers and absorbent pads. These products, many of which bear the Cryovac trademark, package a broad range of perishable foods. The Company primarily sells the
products in this segment to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses.

The
Company's principal protective packaging products provide cushioning, surface protection and void fill. The Company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to
distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries.

The
Company's global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately 2,600 employees in the countries in which it operates, who sell and market the Company's products through a large
number of distributors, fabricators and converters, as well as directly to end users such as food processors, food service businesses, and manufacturers. The Company has no material
long-term contracts for the distribution of its products. In 2004, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated net sales. Although
net sales of both food
packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, the Company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business.

Competition
for most of the Company's packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Competition is also based upon innovations in
packaging technology and, as a result, the Company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership.

The
Company's net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers' business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Its
costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemical-related costs, which are not within the Company's control. Consequently, the Company's management focuses on reducing those costs that the
Company can control and using petrochemical-based raw materials as efficiently as possible. The Company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business
conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors.

As
is discussed below, the Company's business generates substantial cash flow. The Company believes that this cash flow will permit it to continue to spend significantly on innovative
research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment. Moreover, its ability to generate substantial cash flow should
provide the Company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises. The Company also believes that this cash flow will enable the Company to make the settlement
payment, including interest, that will be required of the Company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy, as discussed below.

Effective
January 1, 2004, the Company renamed its two reportable business segments "Food Packaging" and "Protective Packaging." This change reflects the Company's decision to
include its medical films, tubing and connectors, which are used with a variety of medical applications, in the segment also containing its food packaging products. These specialty medical products
had previously been a part of the segment containing the Company's protective packaging products. In addition, commencing as of January 1, 2004, the Company has allocated the expenses related
to the implementation of its global information systems to its reportable business segments rather than reflecting them in unallocated corporate operating expenses. Prior periods have been adjusted to
conform to the 2004 presentation.

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company included the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs in interest expense. Previously, the amortization expense was
included in administrative expenses. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Net Sales

The principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended December 31, 2004 were changes in unit volume, added net sales of
acquired businesses, changes in product mix and average selling prices, and foreign currency translation.

Net
sales in 2004 increased 8% to $3,798.1 million compared with $3,531.9 million in 2003. The components of the increase in net sales for 2004 were as follows (dollars in

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $159.4 million in 2004. Excluding the positive effect of foreign
currency translation, net sales would have increased 3% compared with 2003. The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2004 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign
currencies in Europe and the Asia Pacific region against the U.S. dollar.

Foreign
currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of $189.5 million in 2003. Excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation, net sales would have
increased 4% compared with 2002. The favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2003 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in Europe and the Asia Pacific
region against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakness of the Brazilian real.

Net
sales of the Company's food packaging segment, which consists primarily of the Company's Cryovac® food packaging products, constituted 62%, 63% and 62% of net sales in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
Company's protective packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales. This segment aggregates the Company's protective packaging products and shrink packaging products, all of
which are used principally for non-food packaging applications.

Food Packaging Segment Sales

Net sales of food packaging products increased 6% in 2004 to $2,346.9 million compared with $2,218.6 million in 2003 and increased 12% in 2003
compared with $1,988.0 million in 2002. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on this segment of $109.8 million in 2004. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation
effect, net sales for this segment would have increased 1% in 2004. Excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect of $129.6 million, net sales for this segment would have increased
5% in 2003.

In
2004, unit volumes increased in Latin America and to a lesser extent, in Asia Pacific and Europe, partially offset by a decrease in North America. The decrease in North America was
due to import restrictions imposed by several countries on U.S. beef products, which adversely affected the sales of food packaging products to the Company's customers that process U.S. beef for
export, and challenging U.S. beef market conditions.


Among the classes of products in the food packaging segment, in 2004 net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 6% to $1,976.5 million compared with
$1,868.0 million in 2003 and increased 11% in 2003 compared with 2002 sales of $1,687.1 million. The components of the increase in net sales for 2004 and 2003 were as follows (dollars in

Net
sales from operations in the United States represented 52% and 55% of net sales in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net sales from U.S. operations increased 5% in 2003 to
$1,844.8 million compared
with $1,758.8 million in 2002. Net sales from international operations increased 17% in 2003 to $1,687.1 million compared with $1,445.5 million for 2002. Excluding the
$189.5 million positive foreign currency translation effect, international net sales would have increased 4% compared with 2002.

Costs and Margins

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 30.6% in 2004, 31.5% in 2003 and 33.0% in 2002. The decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to
petrochemical-related raw material cost increases and reduced sales volumes in the Company's North American food packaging business due to import restrictions on U.S. beef products. The decrease in
2003 compared with the 2002 period was primarily due to increased petrochemical-based raw material costs.

administrative and development expenses increased 9% in 2004 and 6% in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency translation, expenses
associated with the upgrade of the Company's information technology platform, and expenses to support the higher volume of net sales. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to the impact of foreign
currency translation and the impact of increased sales volumes, partially offset by the absence of corporate projects completed during 2002. Marketing, administrative and development expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 16.5% in 2004, 16.2% in 2003 and 16.9% in 2002.

2004 Restructuring Program

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the
Company's long-term growth programs and financial goals and to improve the Company's operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure. The plans will principally reduce the
number of employees and consolidate or relocate operations in both of the Company's reportable business segments. The Company expects to eliminate 473 full-time employees, of which 50
employees had been eliminated prior to December 31, 2004. However, with the prospective addition of approximately 100 positions in connection with the Company's realignment or relocation of
certain manufacturing activities, the net reduction in headcount positions is expected to be approximately 373. These actions affected principally production workers and members of the Company's sales
force. The Company expects to complete these activities by June 2006. These charges consisted of the following:

The
long-lived asset impairment of $10.3 million consisted of write-downs and write-offs of property and equipment. The impairments related
to decisions to rationalize and realign production of some of the Company's smaller product lines and to close several smaller scale European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted cash
flows, including estimated salvage value, were less than the carrying values of these assets, they were written down to their estimated fair value. The Company plans to dispose of these facilities and
much of the equipment by mid-2005.

The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December 31, 2004 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2004 were as follows:

Operating Profit

Operating profit decreased 7% in 2004 and increased 5% in 2003. The decrease in operating profit in 2004 was due to $33.0 million of restructuring and
other charges, $53.7 million of higher marketing, administrative and development expenses, an increase in petrochemical-related raw material costs, reduced sales volumes in the Company's North
American food packaging business, offset by an increase in total net sales, all of which are discussed above. The 5% increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased net sales offset by increased cost
and expenses associated with higher sales volumes, increased raw material costs and the impact of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit was 13.2% in 2004, 15.3%
in 2003 and 16.1% in 2002.

Operating
profit by business segment for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows (dollars in millions):

The
food packaging segment contributed 59%, 65% and 61% of the Company's operating profit in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, before taking into consideration
unallocated corporate operating expenses and restructuring and other (charges) credits. The Company's protective packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit.

The
decrease in the food packaging segment's operating profit in 2004 was due to higher raw material costs and reduced sales volumes in North America due to import restrictions on U.S.
beef products. Although the protective packaging segment was also impacted by higher raw materials costs, operating profit increased for the protective packaging segment in 2004 due to higher unit
volumes, benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives and price increases implemented to help offset rising raw material costs.

Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs

On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims
made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius
Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies, that had been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December 3, 2002, the Company's Board of
Directors approved the agreement in principle. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. For a description of the
Cryovac transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties involved, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions "Cryovac Transaction" and
"Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction."

The
Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. The
charge consisted of the following items:

•

a
non-cash charge of $512.5 million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a
plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become


effective,
the Company recorded this liability as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at
a 5.5% annual rate from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The accrued interest, which is compounded annually, was $58.9 million and $29.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

•

a
non-cash charge of $321.5 million representing the fair market value at the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Company's
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Grace's plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust
for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company's common stock. The fair market value of the Company's common stock was $35.72 per share as of the close of
business on December 5, 2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002, as follows: $0.9 million representing the aggregate par
value of these shares in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining
$320.6 million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional paid-in capital. The
December 31, 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation reflects the shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.

•

$16.1 million
of legal and related fees as of December 31, 2002.

Asbestos
settlement and related costs in 2004 and 2003 reflect legal and related fees for asbestos-related matters of $2.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

Interest Expense and Other Income, net

Interest expense (which includes the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs, bond discount and terminated
treasury locks) was $153.7 million in 2004, $136.0 million in 2003 and $65.9 million in 2002. The increase in interest expense in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to the
following:

•

an
increase of $37.2 million of interest expense in 2004 due to the Company's issuance of approximately $300.0 million of senior notes in April 2003 and
$1.3 billion of senior notes and convertible senior notes in July 2003 as discussed below, partially offset by:

•

a
decrease of $16.4 million of interest expense due to the repurchase of $172.5 million face amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the
senior note redemption and repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 discussed below.

The
increase in interest expense in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to:

•

an
increase of $27.3 million of interest expense in 2003 on the portion of the asbestos settlement to be paid in cash; and

•

an
increase of $43.6 million of interest expense in 2003 due to the Company's issuance of the senior notes and convertible senior notes in April and July 2003.

Other
income, net, was $7.8 million in 2004, $8.4 million in 2003 and $7.1 million in 2002. Included in these amounts are primarily interest and dividend income of
$7.7 million, $6.8 million, and $3.1 million and net foreign exchange transaction losses of $9.0 million, $2.8 million and $4.0 million in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.


Income Taxes

The Company's effective income tax rate was an expense of 33.3% in 2004 and 36.2% in 2003. In 2002, the Company recorded a benefit of 21.1%. The decrease in the
2004 effective tax rate compared with 2003 was primarily due to improved tax efficiencies resulting from reorganizing the Company's international subsidiaries, tax effects from debt retirement, state
taxes and a change in foreign tax law, partially offset by some of the 2004 business restructuring expenses which were not able to be recognized for tax purposes.

The
change in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2002 was primarily due to the improved tax efficiency in 2003 resulting from reorganizing the Company's international subsidiaries
during 2002 and the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement and related costs in 2002.

In
2004, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to the lower net effective tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by state
income taxes. In 2003, the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset
by the lower net effective tax rate on foreign earnings. In 2002, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax
benefit for the asbestos settlement.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, known as the AJCA, became law. The AJCA provides a deduction of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that the Company
repatriates, as defined in the AJCA, in 2005. This deduction produces the equivalent of a 5.25% effective tax rate on the repatriated earnings. The Company qualifies to repatriate up to approximately
$500 million.

The
Company is evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision. During the evaluation, the Company is principally considering global cash management objectives, its overall tax
position and restrictions on the use of repatriated cash. Pending completion of this evaluation, a range of potential income tax effects of repatriating cannot be reasonably estimated. If the Company
determines to repatriate funds in reliance upon the AJCA, the repatriation must be completed by the end of 2005.

The
AJCA also provides a deduction for qualified production activities. The impact of the qualified production activities deduction on the Company's taxable income is currently being
evaluated. While the implications of this provision vary based on transition rules and the future income mix, the Company expects the provision will provide a favorable impact on its effective tax
rate in the future.

The
Company currently expects an effective tax rate of approximately 33.3% for 2005, excluding the impact of any repatriation under the AJCA.

Net Earnings (Loss)

As a result of the factors noted above, net earnings were $215.6 million in 2004 and $240.4 million in 2003. The Company recorded a net loss of
$309.1 million in 2002, reflecting the asbestos settlement and related costs of $850.1 million.

Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share were $2.56 for 2004, $2.21 for 2003 and $(4.20) for 2002. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share were $2.25 for 2004,
$1.97 for 2003 and $(4.30) for 2002.


During 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," which was effective for
reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company's 3% convertible
senior notes due June 2033, which were issued in July 2003, be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to convert the debt
into shares of common stock had been satisfied. EITF Issue No. 04-08 is applicable retroactively and requires restatement of prior periods during which the contingent convertible
debt instrument was outstanding. As a result, the 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculations include 6.2 million additional shares of common stock and exclude the associated
interest expense of $7.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, on the contingent convertible debt, net of income tax.

The
diluted earnings per common share for 2003 include a $0.26 per common share charge related to the Company's redemption of all of its outstanding shares of Series A convertible
preferred stock on July 18, 2003. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $51.00 per share. The Company
also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $2.40 million. The $51.00 per share redemption price included
a $1.00 per share redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $25.5 million, and is reflected in basic earnings per common share in 2003.

The
basic earnings per common share calculations for 2003 and 2002 include gains of $0.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively, attributable to the repurchase of
preferred stock. The Company did not recognize any such gains for 2004 since it had redeemed all shares of its outstanding preferred stock during the third quarter of 2003.

For
the purpose of calculating its diluted loss per common share for 2002, net earnings ascribed to common shareholders have been adjusted to exclude the gains attributable to the
repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock, and the weighted average common shares outstanding also have been adjusted to reflect
conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during this period in accordance with the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-53 guidance.

In
calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Company's calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2004 and 2003 provides for the conversion of the Company's
3% convertible senior notes due June 2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No. 04-08, provides for the issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the
Company's previously announced asbestos settlement (as described above under the caption "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs"), and provides for the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of
assumed treasury
stock repurchases. For 2002, the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares provides for the effect of the weighted average conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock. The
Company has not assumed the conversion of the outstanding preferred stock in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in 2002, because the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock
into which it was convertible would have been anti-dilutive, meaning the issuance would reduce the loss per common share. The Company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved
for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in 2002, since the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Material Commitments and Contingencies

Asbestos Settlement; Commitment Related to the Cryovac Transaction

The Company recorded a charge of $512.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 covering the cash payment that the Company is required to make upon the
effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace & Co. The Company did not use cash in 2004 or 2003 with respect to this liability, and the Company cannot predict when
it will be required to make this payment. The Company currently expects to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations, and funds available under
its $350.0 million unsecured multi-currency credit facility or its accounts receivable securitization program, both described below, or a combination of these alternatives.

The
Company is subject to other contingencies related to the Cryovac transaction. Note 19, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, describes these contingencies under "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Contractual Commitments

The
asbestos settlement is described more fully in "Asbestos Settlement; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" above.

In
addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above, the Company is obligated under the terms of various operating leases covering some of
the facilities that it occupies and some production equipment, most of which are accounted for as operating leases. The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent
estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2004. The long-term debt shown in the above
table excludes unamortized bond discounts and interest rate swap adjustments as of December 31, 2004 and, therefore, represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each
period.

The
Company has the following significant long-term contractual commitments:

•

$15.0 million
remaining obligation for the purchase of equipment over a five-year period, which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee
in an amount to be determined. The Company's obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Failure to
purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2004 and 2003, the Company did not meet the minimum equipment
purchase requirements and recorded a charge of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively.

•

$10.5 million
minimum remaining commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four-year period that began in
2004.

•

$7.3 million
to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase an additional 109.5 million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price,
over a ten-year period that ends in May 2012. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Company's purchase of minimum quantities required under
the contract. At December 31, 2004, the Company's purchases satisfied the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement.

•

$1.6 million
to a supplier of equipment and consumables (declining to $0.3 million over the five-year term of the commitment) if the Company fails
to purchase approximately $6.5 million of consumables per year over a five-year period that began in 2004.

•

3.1 million
euros ($4.1 million at December 31, 2004) to a supplier of electricity over a two-year period that began in 2004.

Interest Payments

During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid $141.3 million and $84.3 million, respectively, in interest payments. The Company currently expects to pay
from $110.0 million to $120.0 million in interest payments in 2005, excluding the impact of interest rate swap transactions. The actual interest paid in
2005 may be different from this amount if the Company repurchases existing indebtedness, or incurs indebtedness under its existing lines of credit, or otherwise. This 2005 expected interest payment
does not reflect payment of any accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement.

Income Tax Payments

During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid $141.9 million and $161.3 million, respectively, in income taxes. The Company currently expects to pay
between $160.0 million and $175.0 million in income taxes in 2005, assuming no asbestos settlement payment is made.


Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for many of its non-U.S. employees. During 2004 and
2003, the Company paid $15.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively, in employer contributions to these defined benefit pension plans.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory
and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money
and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined
or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations
at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As
some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as
necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not
material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

Principal Sources of Liquidity

The Company's principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and short-term investments, cash flows from operations and amounts available under
its existing lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization facility.

Accumulated Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had accumulated cash and cash equivalents of $358.0 million and $297.8 million, respectively,
and short-term investments of $54.1 million and $67.2 million, respectively.

The
Company's short-term investments consist of auction rate securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale securities. In 2004, the
Company reclassified these securities from "cash and cash equivalents" to "short-term investments—available-for-sale securities." As a result, the
Company reclassified the $67.2 million of auction rate securities held at December 31, 2003 from "cash and cash equivalents" to "short-term
investments—available-for-sale securities." The Company also made corresponding adjustments to its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These reclassifications
had no impact on the results of operations of the Company. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies—Short-Term
Investments—Available-for-Sale Securities," to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which describes these short-term investments.

Cash Flows from Operations

The Company expects that it will continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. See "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows" below.


Revolving Credit Facilities

The 2006 Facility.

On December 19, 2003, the Company entered into a $350.0 million unsecured multi-currency
revolving credit facility that matures in 2006. The Company has not borrowed under the 2006 facility since its inception.

The
2006 facility provides that the Company may borrow for working capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash payment
required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. See Note 19 for further discussion of this matter. The Company may
re-borrow amounts repaid under the 2006 facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. As of December 31, 2004, facility fees were
payable at the rate of 0.15% per annum on the total amounts available under the 2006 facility.

The
Company's obligations under the 2006 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The 2006 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company's long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.

The
2006 facility requires that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially
increase the Company's liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under
the 2006 facility, or refinance the facility, within 60 days.

ANZ Facility.

In March 2002, the Company entered into an Australian dollar 175.0 million,
dual-currency revolving credit facility that expired on March 12, 2005. This facility was reduced to 170.0 million Australian dollars on May 31, 2004, as scheduled
under the terms of the facility. The amount available was equivalent to U.S. $129.7 million at December 31, 2004. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the
Company's Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes and the refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company could have re-borrowed amounts
repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. No amounts were outstanding under the ANZ facility at December 31, 2004 or 2003.
In March 2005, the Company renewed the facility for a 5-year period expiring March 2010, with terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to those in the expiring
facility.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Program

Since December 2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries have maintained an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an
issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. In December 2004, the parties extended this receivables facility for an additional term of three years ending December 7, 2007. Under
this facility, the Company's two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US), sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed Air Funding
Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Sealed Air Funding in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial
paper, subject to specified conditions, up to a maximum of $125.0 million of receivables interests outstanding from time to time. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries
to perform their obligations under the receivables facility.

On
April 2, 2003, the parties amended the receivables facility to provide that Sealed Air Funding could sell receivables interests aggregating up to $60.0 million,
originated only by Sealed Air Corporation (US), to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper until a definitive asbestos settlement agreement, satisfactory to the bank, had been entered into. The
receivables facility again became


available
for the sale of receivables interests originated by Cryovac, Inc. as well as Sealed Air Corporation (US), up to the original maximum of $125.0 million of receivables interests
provided for by the receivables facility, on January 26, 2004.

The
receivables facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December 31, 2004.

The
operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables facility during 2004 or 2003, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from
the consolidated assets reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 or 2003.

The
receivables facility provides for a program fee of 0.375% per annum on the greater of the unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding and 50% of the
$125.0 million purchase limit under the facility. The receivables facility also provides for a commitment fee of 0.20% per annum on the lesser of the unused portion of the facility and 50% of
the purchase limit under the facility. At December 31, 2003, the receivables facility provided for a program fee of 0.45% per annum on the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding, and
a commitment fee of 0.40% per annum on the unused portion of the receivables facility.

The
costs associated with the receivables facility are reflected in other income, net, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper, which was zero for 2004 and 2003 and
$0.4 million for 2002, and program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were $0.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

See
Note 4, "Accounts Receivable Securitization," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this program.

Other Lines of Credit

Substantially all the Company's short-term borrowings of $19.8 million and $18.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Company's U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December 31, 2004 and
2003 were approximately $237.9 million and $215.3 million, respectively, of which approximately $218.1 million and $197.0 million, respectively, were unused.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of $717.6 million and
$693.7 million, respectively, of which $694.2 million and $675.4 million were unused. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the total available lines of credit included
committed lines of credit of $479.7 million and $479.2 million, respectively, and uncommitted lines of credit of $237.9 million and $214.5 million, respectively. The
Company's principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the 2006 facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection
with its lines of credit.

Debt Ratings

The Company's cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings, which are periodically reviewed by credit rating
agencies. The Company's long-term senior unsecured debt is currently rated Baa3 (stable outlook) by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and BBB (negative outlook) by Standard &
Poor's Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. These ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade long-term
senior unsecured debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should
be evaluated independently of any other rating.


Outstanding Indebtedness

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table (amounts in millions):

Senior Notes Issued in July 2003; Recapitalization

In July 2003, the Company issued a total of $1,281.3 million principal amount of its 5.625% senior notes, 6.875% senior notes and 3% convertible
senior notes in transactions exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule 144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The total net proceeds from the
July 2003 issuances were $1,261.1 million after deducting the initial


purchasers'
discount, unamortized bond discount (except for the 3% convertible senior notes) and other offering expenses. The net proceeds consisted of $395.6 million from the 5.625% senior
notes, $444.0 million from the 6.875% senior notes and $421.5 million from the 3% convertible senior notes.

On
July 18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem its Series A convertible preferred stock at the redemption
price of $51.00 per share or $1,298.1 million of cash, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003, for which the Company used
$2.4 million of cash. As discussed in "Analysis of Historical Cash Flows—Repurchases of Capital Stock" below and Note 16 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements,
the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock during 2003 prior to the July 18, 2003 redemption.

Covenants

Each issue of the Company's outstanding senior notes and the Company's outstanding euro notes imposes limitations on the Company's operations and those of
specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2006 facility contains financial covenants relating to
interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity, and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and
amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth, and restrictions on
the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are borrowers under the
facility. The Company was in compliance with these limitations at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Analysis of Historical Cash Flows

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $436.2 million in 2004, $469.7 million in 2003 and $323.9 million in 2002. The decrease in 2004
compared with 2003 was primarily due to lower net earnings after adjustments for non-cash items, and to a lesser extent, changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course
of business, as described below under "Changes in Working Capital."

The
increase in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the following:

•

changes
in the accounts receivable facility, which is described above

;

and

•

changes
in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business, as discussed below under "Changes in Working Capital."

In
2001, the Company sold receivables interests totaling $95.6 million to the financial institutions participating in the Company's accounts receivable facility. Such receivables
interests were not replaced with additional receivables interests in 2002. As a result, the Company recorded a reduction in net cash provided by operating activities in 2002. The financial
institutions participating in the accounts receivable facility held no receivables interests at the beginning or end of 2003 or 2004. Therefore, the accounts receivables facility had no effect on net
cash provided by operating activities in 2003 or 2004.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $91.0 million in 2004, $190.6 million in 2003 and $96.9 million in 2002. In each year,
investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions, and in 2004 and 2003 also consisted of purchases and sales of available-for-sale securities.
The decrease in net cash used in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds of $80.3 million related to net purchases and sales of available-for-sale
securities, and to a lesser extent, lower levels of


capital
expenditures. The increase in net cash used in these activities in 2003 was due to net purchases of $67.2 million related to net purchases and sales of
available-for-sale securities and higher capital expenditures. The Company did not hold any available-for-sale securities during 2002.

Cash
used to complete acquisitions was $6.4 million in 2004, $2.5 million in 2003 and $10.5 million in 2002. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash
acquired in those acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2004, 2003 or 2002. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $102.7 million in 2004, $124.3 million in 2003 and $91.6 million in 2002. Capital expenditures for the Company's
food packaging segment amounted to $81.3 million, $95.5 million and $65.2 million and for the protective packaging segment amounted to $21.4 million, $28.8 million
and $26.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
decrease in capital expenditures in 2004 was primarily due to the completion early in the year of two new plants in the United States and one in Eastern Europe, as well as the
improved productivity of existing assets, which allowed the Company to defer spending on incremental capacity. The increase in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to spending related to
construction of new plants in the United States and Eastern Europe. The Company expects to continue to make capital expenditures as it deems appropriate to expand its business, to replace depreciating
property, plant and equipment and to improve productivity. The Company currently anticipates that capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2005 will be in the range of
$125 million to $150 million. The Company's projection of capital expenditures for 2005 is based upon its capital expenditure budget for 2005, the status of approved but not yet
completed capital projects, anticipated future projects and historic spending trends.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $300.3 million in 2004, $108.9 million in 2003 and $101.5 million in 2002.

The
increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to the following:

•

a
decrease in proceeds from long-term debt in 2004 due to the receipt of net cash proceeds of $1,557.2 million from the issuance of the 5.375% senior
notes in April 2003 and the 5.625% senior notes, the 6.875% senior notes and the 3% convertible senior notes in July 2003, as discussed above;

•

an
increase of $49.5 million in cash used to repurchase the Company's capital stock, as discussed below. In 2004, the Company used $86.2 million to purchase
its common stock, compared with $36.7 million used in 2003 to purchase its Series A convertible preferred stock;

partially
offset by:

•

$1,298.1 million
of cash used to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock on July 18, 2003, as discussed above;

•

$41.9 million
of cash used in 2003 to pay dividends on the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, prior to its redemption in July 2003;


•

an
increase of $37.9 million in net proceeds from short-term borrowings, as the Company had net proceeds of $0.6 million in 2004 compared with net
payments in 2003 of $37.3 million; and

•

a
decrease of $38.9 million for the payment of long-term debt, as the Company used $237.8 million of cash in 2004 compared with
$276.7 million in 2003; the amounts in both periods include the cash used to redeem and repurchase long-term debt as discussed below.

The
increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the following:

•

cash
of $1,298.1 million used in 2003 to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock on July 18, 2003, as discussed
above;

•

an
increase in cash used of $36.7 million for the payment of long-term debt, as the Company used $276.7 million of cash in 2003 and
$240.0 million of cash in 2002 for that purpose; the amounts in 2003 include the cash used to repurchase capital market debt as discussed below;

•

an
increase of $7.9 million in 2003 compared with 2002 in cash used to purchase the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock, as discussed below;

partially
offset by:

•

net
cash proceeds of $1,557.2 million from issuance of the 5.375% senior notes in April 2003 and of the 5.625% senior notes, the 6.875% senior notes and the 3%
convertible senior notes in July 2003, as discussed above;

•

a
decrease in net payments of short-term borrowings of $39.8 million, as the Company used $37.3 million of cash in 2003 and $77.1 million in
2002 for that purpose; and

•

net
proceeds of $13.9 million in 2003 from the Company's termination of U.S. Treasury lock agreements that were entered into to manage interest rate risks arising
from the then-planned issuance of the 5.375% senior notes, the 5.625% senior notes and the 6.875% senior notes, as described more fully in "Derivative Financial Instruments" below.

Repurchases of Capital Stock

The Company repurchased 1,781,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $86.2 million in 2004, 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible
preferred stock at a cost of $36.7 million in 2003 and 782,500 shares of its preferred stock at a cost of approximately $28.8 million in 2002. The average price per share of these common
or preferred stock repurchases was $48.38, $48.94 and $36.85 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As discussed in "Outstanding Indebtedness—Senior Notes Issued in July 2003;
Recapitalization" above and Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, in July 2003 the Company issued $1,281.3 million of senior notes. The Company used an aggregate of
$1,298.1 million from the proceeds of these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock.

The
share repurchases described above were made under a program previously adopted by the Company's Board of Directors. The share repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up to
approximately 16,977,000 shares of common stock, which included Series A convertible preferred stock on an as-converted basis prior to its redemption. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had repurchased approximately 11,897,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock on an as-converted basis, and the remaining repurchase authorization covered
approximately 5,080,000 shares of common stock. The Company may from time to time continue to repurchase its common stock.


Debt Redemption and Repurchases

2004 Debt Redemption:

On November 26, 2004, the Company used net cash of $211.8 million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount,
$177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150.0 million. The
Company had issued the senior notes on June 26, 2001 under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with
the indenture governing the notes. The net cash used of $211.8 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $213.4 million and cash
received of $1.6 million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes,
which resulted in a loss of $29.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases." The annual interest expense on the redeemed
notes was approximately $15.5 million, without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the senior notes.

2004 and 2003 Debt Repurchases:

In November and December 2004, the Company used available cash of $25.2 million to repurchase in the open market $22.7 million face amount of
its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009, which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a
loss of $2.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases."

In
December 2003, the Company used net cash of $208.2 million to repurchase in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes and
$50.0 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes with a total notional amount of $100.0 million. The net cash used of
$208.2 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $208.9 million and cash received of $0.7 million related
to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed these repurchases at premiums to the face amounts of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $33.6 million, which the Company
reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases."

The
Company may from time to time continue to repurchase or otherwise retire its outstanding indebtedness.

Changes in Working Capital

At December 31, 2004, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $307.4 million compared with $280.4 million at
December 31, 2003.

The
increase in the Company's working capital during 2004 arose primarily from the following changes:

•

an
increase of $47.3 million in notes and accounts receivable, primarily due to $29.0 million from the effects of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser
extent, an increase in net sales (excluding foreign exchange) during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with the fourth quarter of 2003;

•

an
increase of $46.7 million in inventories, primarily due to increased petrochemical-based raw materials costs from December 31, 2003, quantity increases in
the ordinary course of business and $15.8 million from the effects of foreign currency translation; and


•

an
increase in cash and cash equivalents of $60.2 million primarily due to cash flows generated from operations;

partially
offset by;

•

an
increase of $56.8 million in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to vendors, the increased levels of inventory as discussed above, and to a lesser
extent, $8.4 million from the effects of foreign currency translation;

•

an
increase of $16.9 million in accrued restructuring costs which are described above more fully in "2004 Restructuring Program;" and

•

an
increase of $22.2 million in accrued interest primarily due to $29.9 million of accrued interest related to the asbestos settlement liability, partially
offset by a net decrease in accrued interest of $6.3 million related to the 8.75% senior notes that were redeemed in November 2004, as discussed above.

Current and Quick Ratios

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, known as the current ratio, was 1.2 at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The ratio of current assets less
inventory to current liabilities, known as the quick ratio, was 0.9 at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Interest Rate Swaps

At December 31, 2004, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300.0 million that qualify and were designated as fair
value hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to convert the 5.375% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a reduction to
long-term debt to record the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $7.6 million and an offsetting adjustment to other liabilities to record the
fair value of the related interest rate swaps.

In
connection with the Company's redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes in November 2004, as discussed above, the
Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million and received net cash proceeds of $1.6 million.

The
Company also reduced interest expense by $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the
year.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

At December 31, 2004, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, which did not have a significant impact on the Company's liquidity.

For
further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk."

Shareholders' Equity

The Company's shareholders' equity was $1,333.5 million at December 31, 2004, $1,123.6 million at December 31, 2003, and
$813.0 million at December 31, 2002.

Shareholders'
equity increased in 2004 principally due to the following:

•

net
earnings of $215.6 million;


•

a
reduction of foreign currency translation adjustment of $69.2 million;

•

the
net effect of transactions under the Company's contingent stock plan of $9.8 million;

partially
offset by:

•

repurchases
of the Company's common stock in 2004 at a cost of $86.2 million.

Shareholders'
equity increased in 2003 principally due to the following:

•

net
earnings of $240.4 million;

•

a
reduction of foreign currency translation adjustment of $75.2 million;

•

the
conversion of preferred stock into common stock of $16.9 million;

•

the
net effect of transactions under the Company's contingent stock plan of $8.3 million;

•

the
exercise of stock options granted prior to the Cryovac transaction under the Company's stock option plans of $4.7 million;

•

unrecognized
gain on derivative instruments of $8.0 million, net of income tax, related to the termination of the Company's U.S. Treasury lock agreements discussed
above; and

•

the
Company's contribution of its common stock to its profit sharing plan of $9.8 million;

partially
offset by:

•

the
Company's redemption of its Series A convertible preferred stock at its redemption price of $51.00 per share, which included a $1.00 per share redemption premium,
or $25.5 million in the aggregate; and

•

Series A
convertible preferred stock dividends of $28.6 million.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements

The Company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 20,
"New Accounting Pronouncements—Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, known as US GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and
assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates may form the basis of the
carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ from estimates,
and while any differences may be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe that the differences, taken as a whole, will be material.


The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts—The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required
payments. Additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Company's customers deteriorates.

Commitments
and Contingencies—Litigation—On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it.
While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense
related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes
estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent
uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions
or disclosures that the Company has previously made.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets—The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year. A review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may
be impaired. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets
and possible impairment expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Self-Insurance—The
Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit
claims. The Company accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported, and projected claims based upon management's estimates of the aggregate liability for
uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record
estimated claim payments, actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities.

Pensions—Although
the Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees
of the Company are eligible to participate, the Company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. employees and for many of its non-U.S. employees. The
Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions." Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the
expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS
No. 87.

Income
Taxes—The Company's deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards. The Company believes that its taxable earnings
during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related
future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company
provides a valuation allowance.


In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the
realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be
impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to
adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

information, future events or otherwise.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect its
financial condition and results of operations. The Company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative
financial instruments. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rates

From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps, collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

The
Company's interest rate swaps are described in Note 14, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is contained in Item
8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The
Company reduced interest expense by $6.2 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to the impact of interest
rate swaps that were outstanding during each year.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no collars or options outstanding.

The
fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as
interest rates rise. At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of the Company's total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was $2,111.6 million of which
$2,091.8 million was fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the Company's total debt, which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps, was
$2,280.4 million of which approximately $2,262.2 million was fixed-rate debt. The estimated fair value of the Company's total debt, including the impact of outstanding
interest rate swaps, and the cost of replacing the Company's fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates, was $2,231.6 million at December 31, 2004 compared with
$2,445.3 million at December 31, 2003. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would result in an


increase
in the fair value of the total debt balance at December 31, 2004 of $123.7 million. These changes in the fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt do not alter the Company's
obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt.

Foreign Exchange Rates

The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest
rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing, while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping
borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap
agreements outstanding.

The
Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The terms of these instruments are generally twelve
months or less. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $342.3 million and
$161.9 million, respectively. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination
of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates, was zero and a net payable of $0.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A hypothetical 10% adverse
change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2004 would have caused the Company to pay approximately $3.1 million to terminate these contracts.

The
Company's outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other
than the U.S. dollar was $292.0 million and $270.6 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash
flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities.

Commodities

The Company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its
manufacturing processes. Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Company maintains minimal
inventory levels of commodity raw materials and does not purchase substantial quantities in advance of its production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks related to
changes in commodity prices of these components.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Sealed Air Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited consolidated financial statement schedule II—valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in "Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO)," and our report dated March 21, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting

SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Amounts in tables in millions of dollars, except share and per share data)

Note 1 General

Sealed Air Corporation (the "Company"), operating through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products.

The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US). These two subsidiaries directly
and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in
connection with the Cryovac transaction. See Note 19 for a description of the Cryovac transaction and related terms used in these notes.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all significant intercompany
transactions and balances in consolidation. All amounts are approximate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. Such
reclassifications included the following:

•

Effective
January 1, 2004, the Company renamed its two reportable business segments as "Food Packaging" and "Protective Packaging." This change reflects the Company's
decision to include its medical films, tubing and connectors, which are used with a wide variety of medical applications, in the segment with its food packaging products. These specialty products had
previously been a part of the same segment as the Company's protective packaging products. In addition, commencing as of January 1, 2004, the Company has allocated the expenses related to the
implementation of its global information systems to its reportable business segments rather than reflecting them in the unallocated corporate operating expenses. See Note 3, "Business Segment
Information."

•

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company included the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs in interest expense. Previously, the
amortization expense was included in administrative expenses.

•

In
2004, the Company reclassified its auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term
investments—available-for-sale securities. As a result, the Company reclassified the $67.2 million of auction rate securities held at December 31,
2003 from "cash and cash equivalents" to "short-term investments—available-for-sale securities." The Company also made corresponding adjustments to its
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to reflect the purchases and sales of these securities as investing cash flows. These reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations of the Company.
See "Short-Term Investments—Available-for-Sale Securities" below.

•

Certain
deferred tax assets in the amount of $43.0 million have been reclassified from non-current to current as of December 31, 2003 to conform to
the current year's presentation. This reclassification had no impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the Company.


Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, known
as US GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory, the
realization of deferred tax assets, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, assumptions used in the Company's defined benefit pension plans, estimates related to
self-insurance such as the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and estimated trends in claim values, valuation allowances
related to deferred taxes, and accruals for commitments and contingencies, among others. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effects of revisions in the
consolidated financial statements in the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company
has completed the process by which it is entitled to receive consideration. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, shipment has
occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's policy is to invest cash in excess of
short-term operating
and debt service requirements in cash equivalents and short-term investments (discussed below). These instruments are stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short
maturity of the instruments.

Short-Term Investments—Available-for-Sale Securities

The Company's short-term investments consist of auction rate securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale
securities. Such classification is determined at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are
marked-to-market based on quoted market values of the securities, with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
net of tax. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses on the sales of the securities on a specific identification method and includes them in other income, net, in the consolidated statement of
operations. The Company includes interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale in other income, net. The Company has classified its
available-for-sale securities as current assets regardless of their maturity as they are available for use in current operations.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's available-for-sale securities consisted of auction rate securities for which interest or dividend rates are
generally re-set for periods of up to 90 days. The auction rate securities outstanding at December 31, 2004 were investments in preferred stock, which do


not
have maturity dates. In 2004, the Company reclassified its auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term
investments—available-for-sale securities. As a result, the Company reclassified the $67.2 million of auction rate securities held at December 31,
2003 from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments—available-for-sale securities. At December 31, 2004, the Company held auction rate
securities of $54.1 million.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of the available-for-sale securities held by the Company was equal to their cost. The proceeds from the sales
of available-for-sale securities were $416.1 million and $136.1 million in 2004 and 2003. Purchases of available-for-sale securities were
$403.0 million and $203.3 million in 2004 and 2003. There were no gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2004 and 2003.
The Company did not hold any available-for-sale securities during 2002.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional
allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Company's customers deteriorates.

Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation

On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to
determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual
outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has
previously made.

Self-Insurance

The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company
accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management's estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using
historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments,
it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities.

Pensions

Although the Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of
the Company are eligible to participate, the Company also maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. and for many of


its
non-U.S. employees. The Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions." Under these accounting standards, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount
rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these
assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No. 87.

Financial Instruments

The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options
relating to the Company's borrowing and trade activities.

The
Company may use these financial instruments from time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold
or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations.
However, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions with high credit ratings.

The
Company reports all derivative instruments on its balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging
purposes. Prior to entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce the risk and the
correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be
hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews its hedge positions and the
correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments.

The
Company accounts for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments
are effective as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions.

The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying
transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time the Company recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company recognizes
gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated statement of operations.

The
Company's practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments, which on infrequent occasions may be terminated prior to maturity, are
recognized in income in the period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized.


Accounts Receivable Securitization

The Company's two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they can sell eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn sells an undivided ownership
interest in these receivables to a bank or an issuer of commercial paper administered by that bank. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the two operating
subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells interests to the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper. If the wholly-owned subsidiary sells undivided ownership interests in receivables, the
Company removes the transferred ownership interest amounts from its consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sale and reflects the proceeds from the sale in cash provided by operating activities
in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

The
Company reflects retained receivables in notes and accounts receivable on its consolidated balance sheets, and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the
relatively short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated with the sale of receivables in other income, net, in the Company's consolidated statements of
operations.

Inventories

The Company determines the cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis. The cost of U.S. equipment
inventories and most non-U.S. inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or
market.

Property and Equipment

The Company states property and equipment at cost, except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the Company reduces the carrying amount to
the estimated fair value at the impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements; the Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to
expense as incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition
of the assets.

The
Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows: buildings—20 to 40 years;
machinery and other property and equipment—3 to 20 years.

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in business combinations. The Company reflects identifiable intangible assets in other assets at cost. These assets consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and
non-compete agreements. The Company amortizes them over the shorter of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally
ranging from 3 to 20 years. Identifiable intangibles, other than goodwill, individually and in the aggregate, comprise less than 5% of the Company's consolidated assets and therefore are
immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.


The
Financial Accounting Standards Board or the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which require
that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after
June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead test for impairment on a reporting unit
basis at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. A company may initiate a review of goodwill prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.

A
reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment—the "component" level—discrete financial information is
prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in
which case the component is the reporting unit. A company must use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. A company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and for each of the Company's reporting units using an income
approach, which uses forecasted earnings and cash flows, and a market approach, which uses comparisons to other businesses. The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth
quarter of each year. This standard also requires that the Company amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values
and review these for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."

The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 upon issuance and adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. The Company did not amortize any goodwill or any
intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June 30, 2001, but evaluated these for impairment.

Long-Lived Assets

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from long-lived assets are less than their
carrying value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The Company records assets to be disposed of by sale
or abandonment, where management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposition. The Company suspends
depreciation for these assets during the disposal period, which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and
disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements.


Asset Retirement Obligations

In 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 requires companies to record the fair value
of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, which is adjusted to its present value each subsequent period. In addition, companies must capitalize a
corresponding amount by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the useful life of the related long-lived asset.

The
Company has not recorded asset retirement obligations associated with owned or leased buildings because these retirement obligations have an indeterminate settlement date and,
accordingly, the retirement obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company applies the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation as permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. The Company's primary stock-
based employee compensation program is its contingent stock plan. See Note 16 for further information on this plan.

Terminated Stock Option Plans

As of March 31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac transaction (see Note 19), the Company terminated stock option plans in which specified
employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated prior to that date, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to
December 31, 2000. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future.

Foreign Currency Translation

In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with
translation adjustments accumulated in shareholders' equity. The Company translates the statements of operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The Company translates
assets and liabilities of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at
historical exchange rates. The Company translates items reflected in statements of operations of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the period, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates.

Income Taxes

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries file income
tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions. The


Company
provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely in their businesses.

The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carryforwards. The Company determines deferred tax
liabilities and assets at the end of each period using enacted tax rates.

The
Company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards
may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings
indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance.

In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the
realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be
impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to
adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially affect the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Research and Development

The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were $73.2 million, $69.0 million and
$59.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

The Company calculates basic earnings (loss) per common share by dividing net earnings (loss) ascribed to common shareholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding for the period. Net earnings (loss) ascribed to common shareholders represents net earnings (loss) adjusted for gains (losses) attributable to the repurchase or redemption of
preferred stock for an amount below or above its book value, less preferred stock dividends. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share is similar, except that the weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period are adjusted to reflect the potential issuance of dilutive shares, which includes the effect of the conversion of the Company's 3% convertible senior notes,
and net earnings (loss) ascribed to common shareholders are adjusted to reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of income taxes, that would occur as a result of the assumed conversion of the 3%
convertible senior notes.

Environmental Expenditures

The Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments
or remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate the cost or a range of costs associated therewith.


Note 3 Business Segment Information

The Company operates in two reportable business segments: (i) Food Packaging and (ii) Protective Packaging. The Food Packaging segment comprises
primarily the Company's Cryovac® food packaging products. The Protective Packaging segment includes the aggregation of the Company's protective packaging products and shrink packaging
products, all of which products are used principally for non-food packaging applications.

Effective
January 1, 2004, the Company renamed its two reportable business segments as "Food Packaging" and "Protective Packaging." This change reflects the Company's decision to
include its medical films, tubing and connectors, which are used with a wide variety of medical applications, in the segment also containing its food packaging products. These specialty medical
products had previously been a part of the segment containing the Company's protective packaging products. In addition, commencing as of January 1, 2004, the Company has allocated the expenses
related to the implementation of its global information systems to its reportable business segments rather than reflecting them in unallocated corporate operating expenses. Prior period amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

The
Food Packaging segment consists primarily of flexible materials and related systems such as shrink bag and film products, laminated films, and packaging systems marketed primarily
under the Cryovac® trademark for packaging a broad range of perishable foods, as well as medical packaging products. Also included in this segment are rigid packaging and absorbent pads
such as foam and solid plastic trays and containers for the packaging of a wide variety of food products and absorbent pads used for the packaging of meat, fish and poultry. Net sales of flexible
materials and related systems were: 2004—$1,976.5 million; 2003—$1,868.0 million; and 2002—$1,687.1 million. Net sales of rigid packaging and
absorbent pads were: 2004—$370.4 million; 2003—$350.6 million; and
2002—$300.9 million. The Company primarily sells products in this segment to food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers and food service businesses.

The
Protective Packaging segment consists primarily of cushioning and surface protection products such as Bubble Wrap® cushioning and other air cellular cushioning materials;
shrink and non-shrink films principally for non-food applications; polyurethane foam packaging systems sold under the Instapak® trademark; polyethylene foam sheets
and planks; Jiffy® mailers and bags and other protective and durable mailers and bags; paper-based protective packaging materials; suspension and retention packaging; inflatable packaging;
and packaging systems. Net sales of cushioning and surface protection products were: 2004—$1,396.4 million; 2003—$1,265.4 million; and
2002—$1,171.4 million. Net sales of other products for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales. The Company primarily sells products in this segment to
distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries.

Goodwill by Reportable Business Segment

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," and because the Company's management views goodwill
as a corporate asset, the Company has allocated all of its goodwill to the corporate level rather than to the individual segments. However, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," the Company has allocated goodwill to each reportable segment in order to perform its annual impairment review of goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year.
See Note 8 for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment review.


The
allocation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows:

Note 4 Accounts Receivable Securitization

In
December 2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper
administered by the bank. On December 7, 2004, which was the scheduled expiration date of this program, the parties extended this program for an additional term of three years ending
December 7, 2007.

Under
this receivables facility, the Company's two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac, Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation (US), sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility. Sealed Air Funding in
turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to specified conditions, up to a maximum of $125.0 million of
receivables interests outstanding from time to time.

Sealed
Air Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial
paper. The Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from Sealed Air Funding to the bank and
the issuer of commercial paper, as "true sales" under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The
Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
Liabilities."

To
secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank,
as agent, in accounts receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse to the Company's, the
operating subsidiaries' or


Sealed
Air Funding's other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a termination event with
respect to the receivables facility has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agents on behalf of Sealed Air
Funding, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper.

Prior
to a termination event under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial
paper to purchase new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the receivables facility.

The
parties amended the receivables facility on April 2, 2003 to provide that Sealed Air Funding could sell receivables interests aggregating up to $60.0 million,
originated only by Sealed Air Corporation (US), to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper until a definitive asbestos settlement agreement, satisfactory to the bank, had been entered into. The
receivables facility again became available for the sale of receivables interests originated by Cryovac, Inc. as well as Sealed Air Corporation (US), up to the original maximum of
$125.0 million of receivables interests provided for by the receivables facility, on January 26, 2004.

The
receivables facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December 31, 2004.

Under
limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates. A downgrade of the Company's
long-term senior unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Ba3 or
below by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the receivables facility.

The
operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables facility during 2004 or 2003, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from
the consolidated assets reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 or 2003.

The
receivables facility provides for a program fee of 0.375% per annum on the greater of the unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding and 50% of the
$125.0 million purchase limit under the facility. The receivables facility also provides for a commitment fee of 0.20% per annum on the lesser of the unused portion of the facility and 50% of
the purchase limit under the facility. At December 31, 2003, the receivables facility provided for a program fee of 0.45% per annum on the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding, and
a commitment fee of 0.40% per annum on the unused portion of the receivables facility.

The
costs associated with the receivables facility are reflected in other income, net, in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper, which were zero for 2004 and 2003 and
$0.4 million for 2002, and program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were $0.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.


Note 5 Acquisitions

During the three-year period from 2002 to 2004, the Company made several acquisitions. The Company acquired these businesses for cash in the aggregate
amount of $6.4 million, $2.5 million and $10.5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. These
acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $2.3 million in 2004, $0.5 million in 2003 and $7.3 million in 2002. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in
those acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2004, 2003 or 2002. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2004, 2003 and 2002. These acquisitions were not
material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

method. The value of U.S. inventories determined by that method amounted to $138.9 million and $137.3 million, respectively. If the Company had used first-in,
first-out or FIFO inventory method, which approximates replacement value, for these inventories, they would have been $24.9 million and $22.6 million higher at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 8 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,953.4 million and $1,939.5 million, respectively.
Beginning January 1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company stopped recording amortization expense related to goodwill. Although the Company no longer systematically
amortizes goodwill, this standard requires that the Company conduct periodic reviews to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. These reviews could result in future
write-downs of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income.

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. The Company
completed its annual testing for impairment for 2004, 2003 and 2002 during the fourth quarter of each year and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis in any of
the periods. See Note 3, "Business Segment Information," for the allocation of goodwill by business segment.

Identifiable Intangible Assets

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of
$77.2 million and $70.8 million, respectively, less accumulated amortization of $61.6 million and $54.5 million, respectively. These identifiable intangible assets
therefore are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $9.0 million for 2004. Assuming no change in the gross
carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at December 31, 2004, the estimated amortization for future years is as follows: 2005—$5.8 million,
2006—$3.7 million, 2007—$2.7 million, 2008—$2.0 million; and 2009—$1.4 million. These assets are reflected in "other assets"
in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite useful lives as defined by SFAS
No. 142.

Based
upon anticipated future results, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize the $323.7 million balance of deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2004, net of the valuation allowance of $30.1 million. The valuation allowance is related to the uncertainty of utilizing $67.2 million of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, or $19.3 million on a tax-effected basis, most of which have no expiration period and $41.9 million of foreign investment tax allowances, or
$11.7 million on a tax-effected basis, that have no expiration period.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, known as the AJCA, became law. The AJCA provides a deduction of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that the Company
repatriates, as defined in the AJCA, in 2005. This deduction produces the equivalent of a 5.25% effective tax rate on the repatriated earnings. The Company qualifies to repatriate up to approximately
$500 million.

The
Company is evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision. During the evaluation, the Company is principally considering global cash management objectives, its overall tax
position and restrictions on the use of repatriated cash. Pending completion of this evaluation, a range of potential income tax effects of repatriating cannot be reasonably estimated. If the Company
determines to repatriate funds in reliance upon the AJCA, the repatriation must be completed by the end of 2005.

The
AJCA also provides a deduction for qualified production activities. The impact of the qualified production activities deduction on the Company's taxable income is currently being
evaluated. While the implications of this provision vary based on transition rules and the future income mix, the Company expects the provision will provide a favorable impact on its effective tax
rate in the future.

Note 11 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges

2004 Restructuring Program

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the
Company's long-term growth programs and financial goals and to improve the Company's operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure. The plans will principally reduce the
number of employees and consolidate or relocate operations in both of the Company's reportable business segments. The Company expects to eliminate 473 full-time employees, of which 50
employees had been eliminated prior to December 31, 2004. However, with the prospective addition of approximately 100 positions in connection with the Company's realignment or relocation of
certain manufacturing activities, the net reduction in headcount positions is expected to be approximately 373. These actions affected principally production workers


and
members of the Company's sales force. The Company expects to complete these activities by June 2006. These charges consisted of the following:

The
long-lived asset impairment of $10.3 million consisted of write-downs and write-offs of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to
rationalize and realign production of some of the Company's smaller product lines and to close several smaller scale European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted cash flows, including
estimated salvage value, were less than the carrying values of these assets, they were written down to their estimated fair value. The Company plans to dispose of these facilities and much of the
equipment by mid-2005. The components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December 31, 2004 and the remaining accrual balance at December 31, 2004 were as

2001 Restructuring Program

During 2001, the Company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses, simplify business processes and organizational structure and refine the
Company's manufacturing operations and product offerings. As a result of this review, the Company announced and implemented a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of
$32.8 million, of which $25.5 million would result in cash outlays by the Company. These charges consisted of $23.9 million for employee termination costs, $7.3 million for
long-lived asset impairments and $1.6 million for facility exit costs. Of the $32.8 million charge, $21.1 million was incurred in the Company's food packaging segment
with the remaining $11.7 million in the protective packaging segment. Since 2001, the Company made adjustments to the original provision amounts.

Note 12    Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs

Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans

The Company has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees. Contributions to this plan, which are made at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock. The Company also maintains
contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and retirement savings plans generally provide for Company
contributions based upon the amount contributed to the plans by the participants. Company contributions to or provisions for its profit-sharing and retirement savings plans are charged to operations
and amounted to $27.0 million, $26.4 million and $36.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004 and 2002 there were no shares of common stock issued for the Company's
contribution to its profit-sharing plan. The value of the 268,180 shares of common stock issued as part of the Company's contribution to the profit-sharing plan in 2003 was $9.8 million, with
the $18.3 million balance of the 2003 contribution to this plan made in cash.

U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans

A limited number of the Company's U.S. employees, including some employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements, participate in defined benefit
pension plans. The following presents the Company's funded status for 2004 and 2003 under SFAS No. 132 for its U.S. pension plans. The

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually, taking into consideration the Company's asset allocation, historical returns, and the current
economic environment.

The
Company's long-term objectives for plan investments are to ensure that, a) there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit obligations to participants over
the life of the plans, b) there is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations, and c) there is a high level of investment return consistent with a prudent
level of investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term volatility less than that of
a pure equity strategy. To accomplish this objective, assets are invested in a balanced and diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. The target asset allocation will typically be
50-65% in equity securities, with a maximum equity allocation of 75%, and 35-50% in fixed income securities, with a minimum fixed income allocation of 25% including cash.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company generally does not offer its employees postretirement benefits other than programs that are required by the foreign countries in which the Company
operates. In the U.S., the Company offers a program that is fully funded by the participating retired employees. These programs are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Since
March 31, 1998, the Company has offered to some U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement
healthcare program. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the accrued benefit liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $2.3 million, $2.2 million and
$2.5 million, respectively. The net periodic postretirement expense and credit components, together with other remaining postretirement healthcare plan disclosures under SFAS No. 132,
are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.


Note 13 Debt

Revolving Credit Facilities:

The 2006 Facility

On December 19, 2003, the Company entered into a $350.0 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility that matures in 2006. The Company
has not borrowed under the 2006 facility since its inception, and no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The
2006 facility provides that the Company may borrow for working capital and general corporate purposes including payment of a portion of the $512.5 million cash payment
required to be paid upon


the
effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy (see Note 19 for further discussion). The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the 2006
facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the 2006 facility. As of December 31, 2004, facility fees were payable at the rate of 0.15% per annum on the total
amounts available under the 2006 facility.

The
Company's obligations under the 2006 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The 2006 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company's long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.

The
2006 facility requires that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially
increase the Company's liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction (see Note 19 for further discussion), the Company would be
required to repay any amounts outstanding under the 2006 facility, or refinance the facility, within 60 days.

ANZ Facility

In March 2002, the Company entered into an Australian dollar 175.0 million, dual-currency revolving credit facility that expired on
March 12, 2005. This facility was reduced to 170.0 million Australian dollars on May 31, 2004, as scheduled under the terms of the facility. The amount available was equivalent to
U.S. $129.7 million at December 31, 2004. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Company's Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes and the refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier
termination of the facility. No amounts were outstanding under the ANZ facility at December 31, 2004 or 2003. In March 2005, the Company renewed the facility for a 5-year
period expiring March 2010, with terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to those in the expiring facility.

Senior Notes Issued in July 2003; Recapitalization

In July 2003, the Company issued a total of $1,281.3 million principal amount of its 5.625% senior notes, 6.875% senior notes and 3% convertible
senior notes in transactions that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule 144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933. The total net proceeds from the
July 2003 issuances were $1,261.1 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount, unamortized bond discount, except for the 3% convertible senior notes, and other offering
expenses. The net proceeds consisted of $395.6 million from the 5.625% senior notes, $444.0 million from the 6.875% senior notes and $421.5 million from the 3% convertible senior
notes.

On
July 18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem its Series A convertible preferred stock at the redemption
price of $51.00 per share or $1,298.1 million of cash, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003, for which the Company used
$2.4 million of cash. As discussed in Note 16 below, the Company had previously repurchased an aggregate of 750,600 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock during 2003,
prior to the July 18, 2003 redemption.


The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes may convert those notes into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 14.2857 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the
notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $70.00 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June 30, 2033. Holders may convert their
convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company's common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price
for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; (2) during any period in which (i) the
long-term credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, or Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
is lower than BB+ or Ba2, respectively, (ii) either Standard & Poor's or Moody's no longer rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or (iii) the notes are not
assigned a rating by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's; (3) during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per
$1,000 principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate; (4) if the notes
have been called for redemption; or (5) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since
their issuance.

The
Company has the option to redeem the 3% convertible senior notes beginning July 2, 2007 at a price equal to 101.286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to
100% of their aggregate principal amount on June 30, 2010.

The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes on June 30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028,
or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Company's common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In
connection with the issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September 5, 2003 the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares of the Company's common stock issuable, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, upon conversion of the notes.
The registration statement became effective on January 23, 2004.

5.375% Senior Notes

On April 14, 2003, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due April 2008 in transactions exempt
from registration in reliance upon Rule 144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes after deducting the initial
purchasers' discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses were $296.1 million.


Debt Redemption and Repurchases

2004 Debt Redemption

On November 26, 2004, the Company used net cash of $211.8 million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount,
$177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes due July 1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150.0 million. The
Company had issued the senior notes on June 26, 2001 under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with
the indenture governing the notes. The net cash used of $211.8 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $213.4 million and cash
received of $1.6 million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes,
which resulted in a loss of $29.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases." The annual interest expense on the redeemed
notes was approximately $15.5 million without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the senior notes.

2004 and 2003 Debt Repurchases

In November and December 2004, the Company used available cash of $25.2 million to repurchase in the open market $22.7 million face amount of
its 6.95% senior notes due May 2009 which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed these repurchases at a premium to the
face amount of the notes, it incurred a loss of $2.6 million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases."

In
December 2003, the Company used net cash of $208.2 million to repurchase in the open market $122.5 million face amount of its 8.75% senior notes and
$50.0 million face amount of its 6.95% senior notes and terminated interest rate swaps on the 8.75% senior notes with a total notional amount of $100.0 million. The net cash used of
$208.2 million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $208.9 million and cash received of $0.7 million related
to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed these repurchases at premiums to the face amounts of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $33.6 million, which the Company
reflected in the statement of operations as "Loss on debt redemption and repurchases."

Covenants

Each issue of the Company's outstanding senior notes and the Company's outstanding euro notes imposes limitations on the Company's operations and those of
specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2006 facility contains financial covenants relating to
interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity, and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and
amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth, and restrictions on
the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are borrowers under the
facility. The Company was in compliance with these limitations at December 31, 2004 and 2003.


Other Lines of Credit

Substantially all the Company's short-term borrowings of $19.8 million and $18.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Company's U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was
11.37% and 12.86% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $237.9 million and
$215.3 million, respectively, of which approximately $218.1 million and $197.0 million, respectively, were unused.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of $717.6 million and
$693.7 million, respectively, of which $694.2 million and $675.4 million were unused. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the total available lines of credit included
committed lines of credit of $479.7 million and $479.2 million, respectively, and uncommitted lines of credit of $237.9 million and $214.5 million, respectively. The
Company's principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the 2006 facility and the ANZ facility. The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection
with its lines of credit.

Note 14 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company reports all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions
entered into for hedging purposes.

The
Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the
Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge
accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The
Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes.


Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure
from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value
associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts,
with aggregate notional amounts of $342.3 million maturing through August 2005 and $161.9 million, which matured through April 2004, respectively. The estimated fair values
of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange
rates, was zero and a net payable of $0.2 million included in other current liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These contracts qualified and were designated as cash
flow hedges, and had original maturities of less than twelve months.

Interest Rate Swaps

From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

2004 Interest Rate Swaps

At December 31, 2004, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300.0 million that qualified and were designated as fair
value hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to convert the 5.375% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a reduction to
long-term debt to record the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $7.6 million and an offsetting adjustment to other liabilities to record the
fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There was no ineffective portion to the hedges recognized in earnings during the period.

In
connection with the Company's redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $177.5 million, of its 8.75% senior notes in November 2004 (see Note 13), the
Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150.0 million and received net cash proceeds of $1.6 million.

The
Company also reduced interest expense by $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the
year.

2003 Interest Rate Swaps

At December 31, 2003, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $400.0 million that qualified and were designated as fair
value hedges. The Company entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the 5.375% senior notes and 8.75% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December 31, 2003, the Company
recorded the following adjustments to long-term debt:

•

an
adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5.375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $6.1 million and an offsetting adjustment to other
liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps; and


•

an
adjustment to record an increase in the fair value of the 8.75% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $3.8 million and an offsetting adjustment to other
assets to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps.

There
was no ineffective portion to the hedges recognized in earnings during the period.

In
connection with the Company's repurchase of a portion of the 8.75% senior notes in December 2003 (see Note 13), the Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total
notional amount of $100.0 million and received net cash proceeds of $0.7 million.

The
Company also reduced interest expense $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the year.

U.S. Treasury Locks

During the three months ended June 30, 2003, the Company entered into U.S. Treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of $700.0 million
that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges. U.S. Treasury lock agreements are instruments used to manage the risks associated with movements in U.S. Treasury rates. The Company entered
into these agreements to manage interest rate risks arising from the planned issuance of the 5.375% senior notes in April 2003 and the planned issuance of the 5.625% senior notes and the 6.875%
senior notes in July 2003 (see Note 13). The Company terminated these U.S. Treasury lock agreements prior to June 30, 2003 and received net cash proceeds of $13.9 million.
The Company has reflected this amount in other comprehensive income and is amortizing and reflecting it as a net reduction of interest expense over the lives of the respective senior notes. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was not party to any U.S. Treasury lock agreements.

The
Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as options and collars to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange options to
manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure
and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency.

The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss), to the extent that these hedges are effective and until it
recognizes the underlying transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. Other comprehensive income (loss) for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 reflected net unrealized after tax gains (losses) of $(0.4) million ($(0.8) million pre-tax) and $8.0 million ($13.3 million
pre-tax), respectively. The estimated net amount of the existing unrecognized net gain on derivative instruments that the Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statement of
operations within the next twelve months is $1.2 million, pre-tax. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income (loss) will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of
open contracts during each reporting period. The Company's practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company
determines the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. The Company's cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were effective hedges, meaning
that they qualified for hedge accounting treatment.


The
Company bears credit losses if the counterparties to its outstanding derivative contracts are unable to perform their obligations. However, it does not expect any counterparties to
fail to perform as they are major financial institutions with high credit ratings and financial strength. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the Company's exposure to losses arising out of derivative
contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations.

Note 15 Financial Instruments

Under US GAAP, the Company must disclose its estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments, including those recorded as assets or liabilities in
its consolidated financial statements and derivative financial instruments.

The
carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.

The
fair value of the Company's euro notes and senior notes are based on quoted market prices. The Company derived the fair value estimates of the Company's various other debt
instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, the Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the Company's estimates.

The
fair value of the debt in the table below differs from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on the market conditions as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.
Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.

The
fair values of the Company's various derivative instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
terminate the contracts at the reporting date.


The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

Credit and Market Risk

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest
or currency exchange rates. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk. The Company's counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments.
The Company monitors the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency
exchange rates and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and
does not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

The
Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business and generally does not require collateral.
Concentrations of credit risk associated with the Company's trade accounts and notes receivable are considered minimal due to the Company's diverse customer base. The terms and conditions of the
Company's credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. The Company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small
group of customers.

Contingent Stock Plan and Directors Stock Plan

The Company's contingent stock plan provides for the grant to employees of awards to purchase common stock (during the succeeding 60-day period). The
Organization and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has set the price to purchase the common stock pursuant to the grants at $1.00 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments
in the event of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, or other events affecting the Company's common stock. Shares issued under the contingent stock plan are restricted
as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three years after award. In the event of termination of employment prior to lapse of the restriction, the shares of contingent stock are
subject to a repurchase option by the Company at the price at which the shares were issued. This restriction lapses prior to the expiration of the vesting period if specified events occur that affect
the existence or control of the Company. The Company credits the aggregate fair value of contingent stock issued to the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts and deducts the
unamortized portion of the compensation from shareholders' equity. The Company charges the excess of fair value over the award price of contingent stock to operations as compensation expense over a
three-year period on a straight-line basis. These charges are included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and amounted to $10.2 million,
$8.2 million, and $7.8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The plan was amended in 2004 to permit tax withholding attributable to vested awards to be paid by withholding a
portion of the shares attributable to such awards.

Non-cash
compensation in 2004, 2003 and 2002 comprises shares issued to non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Company's 2002 Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual grants of shares to
non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to eligible


directors
elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price per share equal to the par value of the shares, as all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees for
non-employee directors. During 2002, the Company adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer until the
non-employee director retires from the Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock. If a
non-employee director makes this election, the non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. The Company charges
the excess of fair value over the price at which shares are issued under this plan to operations at the date of the grant. This charge is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses
and amounted to $0.3 million in 2004, $0.3 million in 2003 and $0.4 million in 2002.

Other Common Stock Issuances

During 2004 the Company issued 50,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share, to a non-employee under an intellectual property purchase agreement
as prepaid royalties under that agreement. These shares vest ratably over a five-year period.

Amortization
expense related to the issuance of 60,000 and 50,000 shares in 2000 and 1999, respectively, of the Company's common stock in exchange for non-employee consulting
services was $0.4 million, $0.8 million and $1.6 million, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These shares vest ratably over a three-to five-year period.
The Company amortizes the cost associated with these shares on a straight-line basis.

Redeemable Preferred Stock—Series A Convertible Preferred Stock

On July 18, 2003, the Company used cash of $1,298.1 million, including net proceeds of the Company's July 2003 senior notes offering of
$1,261.1 million, to redeem all the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at their redemption price of $51.00 per share. The $51.00 per share redemption price
included a $1.00 per share redemption premium, or $25.5 million in the aggregate. The $25.5 million paid for the redemption premium reduced shareholders' equity and net earnings ascribed
to common shareholders in 2003.


During 2003, prior to its redemption, the Company repurchased 750,600 shares of the Company's convertible preferred stock at a cost of $36.7 million,
representing a cost of $0.79 million below book value. During 2002, the Company repurchased 782,500 shares of the convertible preferred stock at a cost of approximately $28.8 million,
representing a cost of approximately $10.3 million below book value. The Company recorded this excess of book value over the purchase price of the preferred stock as an increase to additional
paid-in-capital.

The
following is a summary of changes during 2003 and 2002 in shares of the Company's Series A convertible preferred stock:

Stock Options

Stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March 31, 1998 in connection with
the Cryovac transaction, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the
date of grant. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future. At December 31, 2004, these options had per share exercise prices ranging
from $22.34 to $42.19, a weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately 1.7 years, and terms expiring up to March 2007.

During
2004, 2003 and 2002, the holders exercised options to purchase 33,136, 125,277 and 27,911 shares, respectively, with an aggregate exercise price of $1.1 million,
$4.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the cumulative number of options to purchase 46,820, 45,648 and 23,763 shares of common stock,
respectively, had expired. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, options to purchase 154,522, 188,830 and 335,992 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding at average per share
exercise prices of $40.71, $39.36 and $38.66, respectively.

Note 18 Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share were $2.56 for 2004, $2.21 for 2003 and $(4.20) for 2002. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share were $2.25 for 2004,
$1.97 for 2003 and $(4.30) for 2002.

During
2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-08, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share," which was effective for
reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company's 3% convertible
senior notes due June 2033, which were issued in July 2003, be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to convert the debt
into shares of common stock had been satisfied. EITF Issue No. 04-08 is applicable retroactively and requires restatement of prior periods during which the contingent convertible
debt instrument was outstanding. As a result, the 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculations include 6.2 million additional shares of common stock and exclude the associated
interest expense of $7.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, on the contingent convertible debt, net of income tax.

The
diluted earnings per common share for 2003 includes a $0.26 per common share charge related to the Company's redemption of all of its outstanding shares of Series A
convertible preferred stock on July 18, 2003. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $51.00 per share.
The Company also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from July 1, 2003 through July 17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $2.40 million. The $51.00 per share redemption
price included a $1.00 per share redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $25.5 million and is reflected in basic earnings per common share in 2003.


The
basic earnings per common share calculations for 2003 and 2002 include gains of $0.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively, attributable to the repurchase of
preferred stock. The Company did not recognize any such gains for 2004 since it had redeemed all shares of its outstanding preferred stock during the third quarter of 2003.

For
the purpose of calculating its diluted loss per common share for 2002, net earnings ascribed to common shareholders have been adjusted to exclude the gains attributable to the
repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock and the weighted average common shares outstanding also have been adjusted to reflect
conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during this period in accordance with the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-53 guidance.

In
calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Company's calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2004 and 2003 provides for the conversion of the Company's
3% convertible senior notes due June 2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No. 04-08, provides for the issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the
Company's previously announced asbestos settlement (as described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption "Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs"), and provides for
the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases. For 2002, the calculation of weighted average number of common shares provides for the effect of the weighted average
conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock. The Company has not assumed the conversion of the outstanding preferred stock in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in 2002, because
the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it was convertible would have been anti-dilutive, meaning the issuance would reduce the loss per common share. The
Company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in 2002, since the effect would have been
anti-dilutive.

Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies

Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs

On November 27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the bankruptcy case of
W. R. Grace & Co., known as Grace, to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction described
below. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies, that had been made
against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December 3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the


Company's
Board of Directors. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac
Transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties involved, see "Cryovac Transaction" and "Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction" below.

The
Company recorded a charge of $850.1 million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations as of December 31, 2002. The charge
consisted of the following items:

•

a
non-cash charge of $512.5 million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a
plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this liability as a current liability on the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 5.5% annual rate from December 21, 2002 to the date of payment. The
Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The accrued interest, which is
compounded annually, was $58.9 million and $29.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

•

a
non-cash charge of $321.5 million representing the fair market value at the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Company's
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Grace's plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust
for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company's common stock. The fair market value of the Company's common stock was $35.72 per share as of the close of
business on December 5, 2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002 as follows: $0.9 million representing the aggregate par value
of these shares in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining
$320.6 million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional paid-in capital. The
December 31, 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation reflects the shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.

•

$16.1 million
of legal and related fees as of December 31, 2002.

Asbestos
settlement and related costs in 2004 and 2003 reflected legal and related fees for asbestos-related matters of $2.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

Cryovac Transaction

On March 31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air
Corporation's business under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that transaction, the
parties separated the Cryovac packaging business, which previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, from the remaining businesses previously held by the
Company. The parties then arranged for the contribution


of
these remaining businesses to a company now known as W. R. Grace & Co., and the Company distributed the Grace shares to the Company's stockholders. As a result, W. R. Grace & Co.
became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company
then merged into the former Sealed Air, which became a subsidiary of the Company and changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation (US).

Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction

In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac transaction,
whether accruing or occurring before or after the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac's operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by Grace's subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary
U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction
agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related
liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company.

Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos
liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions and a number of
personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation
product. Neither the former Sealed Air nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has reached resolution
through judgment, settlement or otherwise. As discussed below, Grace's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding has stayed all these cases.

While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction was a
fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for
liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a fraudulent
transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a business
for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it
was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required
to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos claimants. The
Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently signed a settlement agreement, described below, that will resolve all these claims.


In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief that
Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction
would be a fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached
conclusions adverse to the Company, these determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.

On
April 2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999.

In
connection with its Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May 3, 2001, which was modified on
January 22, 2002, under which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the Company and, upon filing and service on the Company, all future asbestos actions. No further
proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court.

Committees
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in Grace's bankruptcy case received the court's permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its
subsidiary Cryovac, Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace &
Co.—Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March 2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction and whether Grace
received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all of Grace's creditors. This proceeding is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
(Adv. No. 02-02210).

In
June 2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that
remediation expenses were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted that the Cryovac
transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July 2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial, holding, among
other things, that, subject to specified limitations, post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace. The Company believes that only claims and liabilities that
were known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable standard.

With
the fraudulent transfer trial set to commence on December 9, 2002, on November 27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting
the claims against the Company and Cryovac, Inc., to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order
confirming that the parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties and that counsel for the Company


and
the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle calls for payment of nine million shares of Sealed Air
common stock and $512.5 million in cash, plus interest on the cash payment at a 5.5% annual rate starting on December 21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the Grace plan of
reorganization, when the Company is required to make the payment. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and other events affecting the Company's common stock. On December 3, 2002, the Company's Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The Company received notice that both
of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December 5, 2002. The parties subsequently signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November 10, 2003 consistent
with the terms of the agreement in principle. On November 26, 2003, the parties jointly presented the definitive settlement agreement to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for
approval. On Grace's motion to the U.S. District Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the settlement agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition. After approval of the agreement,
the agreement will eventually be incorporated into Grace's plan of reorganization and, assuming approval by Grace's creditors as part of the approval of the plan of reorganization, will then be
implemented. The court has not yet addressed the joint motion to approve the definitive settlement agreement. Grace has stated in recent court filings that it does not plan to object to the definitive
settlement agreement, but others, including other creditors of Grace, may do so.

On
June 8, 2004, the Company filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where the fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the court
vacate the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. The Company was not challenging the definitive
settlement agreement. The motion was filed as a protective measure in the event that the settlement agreement is ultimately not approved or implemented; however, the Company still expects that the
settlement agreement will become effective upon the court's approval and Grace's emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement.

As
a condition to the Company's obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, Grace's plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement, including
provisions for the trusts and releases referred to below and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates. In that case, the
settlement will provide that, upon the effective date of Grace's plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against the Company and its
affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its affiliates (including former affiliates that became affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac transaction) will be
channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace's plan of reorganization. The settlement will
also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement will provide
that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from Grace for the Company's payments required by the
settlement. The Company expects that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the
effective date of Grace's plan of reorganization, after which the


Company
will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the Company will be enjoined.

In
January 2005, Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization and related documents with the Bankruptcy Court. There were a number of objections filed, and the Company does not
know whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement or if the other conditions to the Company's obligation to pay the settlement amount will be met. If these
conditions are not satisfied or not waived by the Company, the Company will not be obligated to pay the settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount, the Company and
its affiliates will not be released from the various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, and indemnification claims made against them, and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to
be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials. The Company also cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become effective in
Grace's bankruptcy.

In
January 2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified
affiliates in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities
that they might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties' contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and W. R.
Grace & Co.—Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February 2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they had accrued a charge of $172.0 million
for these potential liabilities, which included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from Grace's Chapter 11 filing. The Company believed
that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the Fresenius parties' claims. In April 2002, the
Fresenius parties filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor. The Company opposed the motion, and in July 2003, the court denied the motion without
prejudice in view of the November 27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement, there will be mutual releases exchanged between the
Fresenius parties and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction.

In
November 2004, the Company's Canadian subsidiary Sealed Air (Canada) Co./Cie learned that it had been named a defendant in the case of

Thundersky v. The
Attorney General of Canada, et al.

(File No. CI04-01-39818), which is pending in the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench. Grace and W. R. Grace &
Co.—Conn. are also named as defendants. The claim is brought as a putative class proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian resident, other than in the
course of employment, as a result of Grace's marketing, selling, processing, manufacturing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada. In January 2005, Grace
and W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn. agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates in respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees and costs, in
this action. Grace's proposed plan of reorganization provides that these claims will be paid by the trusts to be established under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace's plan
of reorganization, and it is anticipated that the defendants will ask the Canadian courts to enforce the terms of the plan of reorganization. Grace Canada, Inc. has previously obtained an order
in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice


recognizing
the Grace Chapter 11 proceeding under the Canadian

Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act

.

In
view of Grace's Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac
transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company.

Final
determinations and accountings under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace's Chapter
11 filing in 2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its affiliates agreed to retain or
that are subject to indemnification by Grace and its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the
Company is responsible for specified amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the liabilities of Grace and its
affiliates to the Company. The Company intends to seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims,
and approximately $8.1 million paid by the Company on account of its guaranty of debt issued by W. R. Grace & Co.—Conn. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or
similar claim, the Company expects that its claims will be as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Company's claims against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated,
the Company cannot determine the amount of the Company's claims, the extent to which these claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the amount of the Company's
recovery on these claims, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding.

On
September 15, 2003, the case of

Senn v. Hickey, et al.

(Case No. 03-CV-4372) was filed in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (Newark). This lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the Company during the
period from March 27, 2000 through July 30, 2002. The lawsuit names the Company and specified current and former officers and directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is
required to provide indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Company's counsel is also defending them. On June 29, 2004, the court granted plaintiff Miles Senn's motion for
appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of his choice of lead counsel. The plaintiff's amended complaint makes a number of allegations against the defendants. The principal allegations are that
during the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public, artificially inflated the price of the Company's common stock by publicly issuing false and misleading statements and
violated US GAAP by failing to properly account and accrue for the Company's contingent liability for asbestos claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages
and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, since the Company believes that it properly disclosed its contingent liability for Grace's asbestos claims. Although the Company
currently believes that it should have no liability in this lawsuit, until the lawsuit has progressed beyond its current preliminary stage, the Company cannot estimate the potential cost of an
unfavorable outcome, if any.


Leases

The Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller
manufacturing sites that it occupies. The Company accounts for substantially all of its leases as operating leases. Net rental expense was $28.2 million, $27.0 million and
$24.3 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable real and personal property leases are as follows:
2005—$27.6 million; 2006—$22.9 million; 2007—$16.0 million; 2008—$9.6 million; 2009—$5.7 million; and
subsequent years—$12.3 million.

Long-Term Commitments

The Company has the following significant long-term commitments:

•

$15.0 million
remaining obligation for the purchase of equipment over a five-year period which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in
an amount to be determined. The Company's obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Estimated
future minimum annual commitments are as follows: 2005—$4.5 million; 2006—$5.0 million; and 2007—$5.5 million. Failure to purchase any of the
minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2004 and 2003, the Company did not meet the minimum equipment purchase requirements and
recorded a charge of $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively.

•

$10.5 million
minimum remaining commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four-year period that began in
2004.

•

$7.3 million
to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase an additional 109.5 million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price,
over a ten-year period that ends in May 2012. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Company's purchase of minimum quantities required under
the contract. At December 31, 2004, the Company's purchases satisfied the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement.

•

$1.6 million
to a supplier of equipment and consumables (declining to $0.3 million over the five-year term of the commitment) if the Company fails
to purchase approximately $6.5 million of consumables per year over a five-year period that began in 2004.

•

3.1 million
euros ($4.1 million at December 31, 2004) to a supplier of electricity over a two-year period that began in 2004.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory
and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money
and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its


consolidated
statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be
better estimated.

The
Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions
with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among
potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company
adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has
adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

Note 20    New Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004," indicating that this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109. Beginning in 2005 as qualifying activity occurs, the Company will recognize the allowable deductions through its effective tax rate at that
time.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004," which provides a practical exception to the SFAS No. 109 requirement to reflect the effect of a new tax law in the period of enactment by allowing
additional time beyond the financial reporting period to evaluate the effects on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. See Note 10, "Income Taxes," for the
required disclosures.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised), "Share-Based Payment." Statement 123 (revised) replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Statement 123 (revised) covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements and requires
that the compensation cost related to these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. Statement 123 (revised) becomes effective for periods starting after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised) will not have an impact on the 2005 consolidated
financial statements as the amounts currently recognized by the Company under its contingent stock plan would essentially be the same.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs," which amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing." This amendment clarifies
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria specified in ARB 43 of "so abnormal." In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of


fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 151 on its consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses how a business
enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and, accordingly, should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaced FIN 46,
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which was issued in January 2003. The Company was required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in VIEs created after December 31, 2003.
For variable interests in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, the Interpretation will be applied beginning on January 1, 2005. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that
were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net
amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair
value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have any impact on the 2004 consolidated
financial statements.

for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. EITF Issue No. 04-08 requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt, such as the Company's 3%
convertible senior notes due June 2033, which were issued in July 2003, be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to
convert the debt into shares of common stock had been satisfied. The 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation includes additional shares of common stock and excludes the associated
interest expense, net of income tax. EITF Issue No. 04-08 was applied on a retroactive basis and requires restatement of prior periods presented during which the contingent
convertible debt instrument was outstanding.


Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that the Company's employees accumulate this information and communicate it to the Company's management,
including its Chief Executive Officer (its principal executive officer) and its Chief Financial Officer (its principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures under Rule 13a-15. The Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, supervised and
participated in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The management of the Company evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness,
as of the end of its 2004 fiscal year, of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The suitable recognized control framework on which management's evaluation of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting is based is the Internal Control—Integrated Framework established and distributed for public comment by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon that evaluation under the COSO framework, the Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its 2004 fiscal
year was effective. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, KPMG LLP, has issued an
attestation report on management's assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. KPMG's attestation report is included below in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sealed Air Corporation:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in "Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)." Sealed Air Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal


control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in "Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)." Also,
in our opinion, Sealed Air Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
"Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)."

We
