PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries
    (“Devon”), is an independent energy company engaged
    primarily in exploration, development and production of natural
    gas and oil. Our operations are concentrated in various North
    American onshore areas in the United States and Canada. We also
    have offshore operations located in Brazil and Angola that are
    currently in the process of being divested.

To complement our upstream oil and gas operations in North
    America, we have a large marketing and midstream operation. With
    these operations, we market gas, crude oil and NGLs. We also
    construct and operate pipelines, storage and treating facilities
    and natural gas processing plants. These midstream facilities
    are used to transport oil, gas, and NGLs and process natural gas.

We began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. We have
    been publicly held since 1988, and our common stock is listed on
    the New York Stock Exchange. Our principal and administrative
    offices are located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK

73102-8260

(telephone 405/235-3611).

Strategy

As an enterprise, we aspire to be the premier independent
    natural gas and oil company in North America. To achieve this,
    we continuously strive to optimize value for our shareholders by
    growing cash flows, earnings, production and reserves, all on a
    per debt-adjusted share basis. We do this by:

•

exercising capital discipline;

•

investing in oil and gas properties with high operating margins;

•

balancing our reserves and production mix between natural gas
    and liquids;

•

maintaining a low overall cost structure;

•

improving performance through our marketing and midstream
    operations; and

•

preserving financial flexibility.

Over the decade leading up to 2010, we captured an abundance of
    resources by carrying out this strategy. We pioneered horizontal
    drilling in the Barnett Shale and extended this technique to
    other natural gas shale plays in the United States and Canada.
    We became proficient with steam-assisted gravity drainage with
    our Jackfish oil sands development in Alberta, Canada. We
    achieved key oil discoveries with our drilling in the deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico and offshore Brazil. We have tripled our proved
    oil and gas reserves since 2000, and have also assembled an
    extensive inventory of exploration assets representing
    additional unproved resources.

Building off our past successes, in November 2009, we announced
    plans to strategically reposition Devon as a North American
    onshore exploration and production company. As part of this
    strategic repositioning, we are bringing forward the value of
    our offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and countries
    outside North America by divesting them. As of the end of 2010,
    we had sold our properties in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan,
    China and other International regions, generating
    $5.6 billion in after-tax proceeds. Additionally, we have
    entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore assets in
    Brazil and Angola and are waiting for the respective governments
    to approve the divestitures. Once the pending transactions are
    complete, we expect to have generated more than $8 billion
    in after-tax proceeds.

This repositioning has allowed us to focus our operations on our
    premier portfolio of North American onshore assets.
    Historically, our North American onshore assets have
    consistently provided us our highest risk-adjusted investment
    returns. By selling our offshore assets, we are able to conduct
    an aggressive, yet disciplined, pursuit of the untapped value of
    these North American onshore opportunities. More specifically,



given the current challenged market for natural gas prices, our
    near-term focus is on the oil and liquids-rich opportunities
    that exist within our balanced portfolio of properties.

Besides investing in our onshore exploration and development
    opportunities, we are also using the divestiture proceeds to
    reduce our debt significantly and conduct up to a
    $3.5 billion common share repurchase program.

Presentation
    of Discontinued Operations

As a result of our November 2009 repositioning announcement, all
    amounts in this document related to our International operations
    are presented as discontinued. Therefore, financial data and
    operational data, such as reserves, production, wells and
    acreage, provided in this document exclude amounts related to
    our International operations unless otherwise provided.

Our U.S. Offshore operations do not qualify as discontinued
    operations under accounting rules. As such, financial and
    operational data provided in this document that pertain to our
    continuing operations include amounts related to our
    U.S. Offshore operations that were divested in 2010. Where
    appropriate, we have presented amounts related to our
    U.S. Offshore assets separate from those of our North
    American Onshore assets.

Development
    of Business

Since our first issuance of common stock to the public in 1988,
    we have executed strategies that have been focused on growth and
    value creation for our shareholders. We increased our total
    proved reserves from 8 MMBoe at year-end 1987 to
    2,873 MMBoe at year-end 2010. During this same time period,
    we increased annual production from 1 MMBoe in 1987 to
    228 MMBoe in 2010. Our expansion over this time period is
    attributable to a focused mergers and acquisitions program
    spanning a number of years, as well as active and successful
    exploration and development programs in more recent years.
    Additionally, our growth has provided meaningful value creation
    for our shareholders. The growth statistics from 1987 to 2010
    translate into annual per share growth rates of 8% for
    production and 11% for reserves.

As a result of this growth, we have become one of the largest
    independent oil and gas companies in North America. During 2010,
    we continued to build off our past successes with a number of
    key accomplishments, including those discussed below.

•

Drilling Success

— We drilled 1,584 gross
    wells in 2010 on our North American onshore properties with a
    99% success rate. We increased oil and NGL production from our
    North American onshore properties by 6% in 2010, to an average
    of 193 MBoe per day.

•

Cana-Woodford Shale

— We drilled 87 wells
    in the Cana-Woodford Shale play in western Oklahoma and more
    than doubled our industry-leading leasehold position in the play
    to more than 240,000 net acres. Our 2010 production exit
    rate from the Cana-Woodford increased more than 210% over the
    prior year to an average of 147 MMcf of gas equivalent per
    day, including 4 MBbls per day of liquids production. We
    also completed construction and commenced operation of our Cana
    gas processing plant in 2010.

•

Permian Basin

— We exited 2010 with Permian
    production of 45 MBoe per day, which represented a 16%
    increase compared to 2009. We have nearly one million net acres
    of leasehold in the region targeting various oil and
    liquids-rich play types.

•

Jackfish

— In 2010, our net production from our
    Jackfish oil sands project averaged 25 MBbls per day.
    Following scheduled facilities maintenance in the third quarter
    and a third-party pipeline system outage in the fourth quarter,
    our net Jackfish production ramped back up to 30 MBbls per
    day at year-end.

Construction of our second Jackfish project is now complete. We
    expect to begin injecting steam at Jackfish 2 in the second
    quarter, with first oil production expected by the end of 2011.
    We applied for regulatory approval of a third phase of Jackfish
    in the third quarter of 2010.



•

Pike

— We added to our Canadian oil position by
    acquiring a 50% interest in the Pike oil sands leases. The Pike
    acreage lies immediately adjacent to our highly successful
    Jackfish project and has estimated gross recoverable resources
    that may exceed Jackfish. We are the operator of the project and
    are currently drilling appraisal wells and acquiring seismic
    data. The drilling results and seismic will help us determine
    the optimal configuration for the initial phase of development.

•

Barnett Shale

— Our 2010 production exit rate
    was 1.2 Bcfe per day, including 43 MBbls per day of
    liquids production. This represents a 16% increase in total
    production compared to the 2009 exit rate.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographical Areas

Notes 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
    our segments and geographical areas.

Oil,
    Natural Gas and NGL Marketing and Delivery Commitments

The spot markets for oil, gas and NGLs are subject to volatility
    as supply and demand factors fluctuate. As detailed below, we
    sell our production under both long-term (one year or more) or
    short-term (less than one year) agreements. Regardless of the
    term of the contract, the vast majority of our production is
    sold at variable or market sensitive prices.

Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging
    arrangements or fixed-price contracts associated with a portion
    of our oil and gas production. These activities are intended to
    support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to
    price fluctuations. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Oil
    Marketing

Our oil production is sold under both long-term and short-term
    agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although
    exact percentages vary daily, as of January 2011, approximately
    81% of our oil production was sold under short-term contracts at
    variable or market-sensitive prices. The remaining 19% of oil
    production was sold under long-term, market-indexed contracts
    that are subject to market pricing variations.

Natural
    Gas Marketing

Our gas production is also sold under both long-term and
    short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties.
    Although exact percentages vary daily, as of January 2011,
    approximately 81% of our gas production was sold under
    short-term contracts at variable or market-sensitive prices.
    These market-sensitive sales are referred to as “spot
    market” sales. Another 18% of our production was committed
    under various long-term contracts, which dedicate the gas to a
    purchaser for an extended period of time, but still at
    market-sensitive prices. The remaining 1% of our gas production
    was sold under long-term, fixed-price contracts.

NGL
    Marketing

Our NGL production is sold under both long-term and short-term
    agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although
    exact percentages vary, as of January 2011, approximately 83% of
    our NGL production was sold under short-term contracts at
    variable or market-sensitive prices. Approximately 9% of our NGL
    production was sold under short-term, fixed-price contracts. The
    remaining 8% of NGL production was sold under long-term,
    market-sensitive price contracts.



Delivery
    Commitments

A portion of our production is sold under certain contractual
    arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and
    determinable quantity. Although exact amounts vary, as of
    January 2011, we were committed to deliver the following fixed
    quantities of our oil and natural gas production:

Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas
    per Bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy
    content of gas and oil. NGLs are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.

We expect to fulfill our delivery commitments over the next
    three years with production from our proved developed reserves.
    We expect to fulfill our longer-term delivery commitments beyond
    three years primarily with our proved developed reserves. In
    certain regions, we expect to fulfill these longer-term delivery
    commitments with our proved undeveloped reserves. See
    Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included
    in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data” of this report for information related to our proved
    reserves, including the development of our proved undeveloped
    reserves.

Our proved reserves have been sufficient to satisfy our delivery
    commitments during the three most recent years, and we expect
    such reserves will continue to satisfy our future delivery
    commitments. However, should our proved reserves not be
    sufficient to satisfy our future delivery commitments, we can
    and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments.

Marketing
    and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations
    is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide
    such services by gathering, processing and marketing oil, gas
    and NGL production in a timely and efficient manner. Our most
    significant midstream asset is the Bridgeport processing plant
    and gathering system located in north Texas. These facilities
    serve not only our gas production from the Barnett Shale but
    also gas production of other producers in the area. We have
    other natural gas processing plants that support our operations,
    including a plant completed in 2010 that serves the
    Cana-Woodford Shale production. Our midstream assets also
    include our 50% interest in the Access Pipeline transportation
    system in Canada. This pipeline system allows us to blend our
    Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate or other
    blend-stock and transport the combined product to the Edmonton
    area for sale.

Our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by:

•

selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams
    processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for
    marketing, and

•

selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport
    pipelines and unrelated third-party pipelines.

Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily
    incurred from:

•

purchasing the gas streams entering our transport pipelines and
    plants;

•

purchasing fuel needed to operate our plants, compressors and
    related pipeline facilities;

•

purchasing third-party NGLs;

•

operating our plants, gathering systems and related
    facilities; and

•

transporting products on unrelated third-party pipelines.



Customers

We sell our gas production to a variety of customers including
    pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and
    local distribution companies. Gathering systems and interstate
    and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and
    deliveries.

The principal customers for our crude oil production are
    refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have
    pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event
    pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is
    trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities.

Our NGL production is primarily sold to customers engaged in
    petrochemical, refining and heavy oil blending activities.
    Pipelines, railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products
    to market.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, no purchaser accounted for over 10%
    of our revenues.

Seasonal
    Nature of Business

Generally, the demand for natural gas decreases during the
    summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal
    anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen
    this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local
    distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas
    storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter
    requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal
    demand fluctuations.

Public
    Policy and Government Regulation

The oil and natural gas industry is subject to various types of
    regulation throughout the world. Laws, rules, regulations and
    other policy implementations affecting the oil and natural gas
    industry have been pervasive and are under constant review for
    amendment or expansion. Pursuant to public policy changes,
    numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and
    regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its
    individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
    for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a
    significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production and
    marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations
    increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
    profitability. Because public policy changes affecting the oil
    and natural gas industry are commonplace and because existing
    laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we
    are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying
    with such laws and regulations. However, we do not expect that
    any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations in
    a manner materially different than they would affect other oil
    and natural gas companies of similar size and financial strength.

During 2010, as part of a strategic restructuring of the
    company, we sold our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the
    majority of our assets outside North America, Additionally, we
    have entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore
    assets in Brazil and Angola and are waiting for the respective
    governments to approve the divestitures. These divestitures
    reduce our vulnerability to laws, rules and regulations imposed
    by foreign governments, as well as those imposed in the United
    States for offshore exploration and production. The following
    are significant areas of government control and regulation
    affecting our operations in the United States and Canada.

Exploration
    and Production Regulation

Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal,
    state, provincial, tribal and local laws and regulations. These
    laws and regulations relate to matters that include, but are not
    limited to:

•

acquisition of seismic data;

•

location of wells;

•

drilling and casing of wells;

•

hydraulic fracturing;



•

well production;

•

spill prevention plans;

•

emissions and discharge permitting;

•

use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and
    materials incidental to oil and gas operations;

•

surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells
    have been drilled;

•

calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production
    taxes;

•

plugging and abandoning of wells; and

•

transportation of production.

Our operations also are subject to conservation regulations,
    including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing
    units or proration units; the number of wells that may be
    drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable from oil and
    gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas
    properties. In the United States, some states allow the forced
    pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration,
    while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and
    leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas
    properties. In addition, state conservation laws generally limit
    the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain
    requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The
    effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and
    gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of
    wells or the locations at which we can drill.

Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted
    by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land
    Management of the Department of the Interior. Such leases
    require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders
    that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on
    lands covered by these leases, and calculation and disbursement
    of royalty payments to the federal government. The federal
    government has been particularly active in recent years in
    evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and
    regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty
    payment obligations for production from federal lands.

Royalties
    and Incentives in Canada

The royalty system in Canada is a significant factor in the
    profitability of oil and gas production. Royalties payable on
    production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by
    negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined
    by government regulation and are generally calculated as a
    percentage of the value of the gross production, with the
    royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices,
    well productivity, geographical location and the type and
    quality of the petroleum product produced. From time to time,
    the federal and provincial governments of Canada also have
    established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions,
    royalty holidays, tax credits and fixed rate and profit-sharing
    royalties for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration
    or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have
    the effect of increasing our revenues, earnings and cash flow.

Pricing
    and Marketing in Canada

Any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract
    that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires
    an exporter to obtain export authorizations from Canada’s
    National Energy Board (“NEB”). The governments of
    Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the
    volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces
    for consumption elsewhere.



Environmental
    and Occupational Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal and
    local international laws and regulations concerning occupational
    safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into,
    and the protection of, the environment. Environmental laws and
    regulations relate to, among other things:

•

assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition,
    drilling or construction activities;

•

the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste
    materials;

•

the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere;

•

the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well
    and other sites, including sites of former operations; and

•

the development of emergency response and spill contingency
    plans.

The application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000
    governing environmental management systems, is required to be
    implemented for some international oil and gas operations.

We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and
    health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our
    business. We have been able to plan for and comply with
    environmental, safety and health initiatives without materially
    altering our operating strategy or incurring significant
    unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends
    and increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and
    operating expenses related to the protection of the environment
    and safety and health compliance have increased over the years
    and will likely continue to increase. We cannot predict with any
    reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning
    such matters.

We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to
    limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial
    environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and
    accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances.
    However, we do not maintain 100% coverage concerning any
    environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect
    to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a
    violation of law.

In 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    (“EPA”) issued rules requiring oil and natural gas
    companies to track and report their greenhouse gas emissions.
    For Devon, this involves collecting emissions data at more than
    17,000 well sites and numerous natural gas plants and
    compressor stations. While these rules increase our cost of
    doing business, we do not anticipate that we would be impacted
    to any greater degree than other similar oil and natural gas
    companies.

The Kyoto Protocol was adopted by numerous countries in 1997 and
    implemented in 2005. The Protocol requires reductions of certain
    emissions of greenhouse gases. Although the United States has
    not ratified the Protocol, the other countries in which we
    operate have. In 2007, Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol and
    committed to reducing Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions.
    This commitment was renewed by signing the Copenhagen Accord in
    2009 and the Cancun Agreement in 2010. Although there is no
    framework in place, Canada remains focused on the original
    reduction target of the Kyoto Protocol and is working to align
    greenhouse gas policy with the United States. The mandatory
    reductions on greenhouse gas emissions will create additional
    costs for the Canadian oil and gas industry, including Devon.
    Provincially, British Columbia and Alberta have greenhouse gas
    legislation and regulation that carry some compliance burden for
    the oil and gas sector. Presently, it is not possible to
    accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any
    future laws or regulations developed to achieve emissions
    reductions in Canada or elsewhere, but such expenditures could
    be substantial.

In 2006, we established our Corporate Climate Change Position
    and Strategy. Key components of the strategy include initiation
    of energy efficiency measures, tracking emerging climate change
    legislation and publication of a corporate greenhouse gas
    emission inventory. We last published our emission inventory on
    January 2008. We will publish another emission inventory on or
    before March 31, 2011 to comply with a reporting mandate
    issued by the EPA. Additionally, we continue to explore energy
    efficiency measures and



greenhouse emission reduction opportunities. We also continue to
    monitor legislative and regulatory climate change developments,
    such as the proposals described above.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    5,000 employees. We consider labor relations with our
    employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages
    or strikes pertaining to our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in
    general, are subject to a variety of risks. If any of the
    following risk factors should occur, our profitability,
    financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted.
    As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of
    their investment in Devon.

Oil, Gas
    and NGL Prices are Volatile

Our financial results are highly dependent on the general supply
    and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, which impact the prices we
    ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. A
    significant downward movement of the prices for these
    commodities could have a material adverse effect on our
    revenues, operating cash flows and profitability. Such a
    downward price movement could also have a material adverse
    effect on our estimated proved reserves, the carrying value of
    our oil and gas properties, the level of planned drilling
    activities and future growth. Historically, market prices and
    our realized prices have been volatile and are likely to
    continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors
    beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited
    to:

•

consumer demand for oil, gas and NGLs;

•

conservation efforts;

•

OPEC production levels;

•

weather;

•

regional pricing differentials;

•

differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus
    heavy or sour crude);

•

differing quality and NGL content of gas produced;

•

the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels;

•

the overall economic environment; and

•

governmental regulations and taxes.



Estimates
    of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
    geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir,
    particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of
    judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop
    different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue
    based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a
    given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result
    of several factors including additional development activity,
    the viability of production under varying economic conditions
    and variations in production levels and associated costs.
    Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates
    may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such
    revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse
    effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our
    financial condition and profitability. Additional discussion of
    our policies and internal controls related to estimating and
    recording reserves is described in “Item 2.
    Properties — Preparation of Reserves Estimates and
    Reserves Audits.”

Discoveries
    or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a
    Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rates from oil and gas properties generally
    decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
    production costs generally increase, due to decreasing reservoir
    pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved
    reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline
    materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful
    exploration and development activities or, through engineering
    studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells,
    secondary or tertiary recovery techniques, or acquire additional
    properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future
    oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production
    costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding
    or acquiring additional reserves.

Future
    Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve
    Substantial Costs

Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire
    properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are
    subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not
    encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The
    costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In
    addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling
    operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

adverse weather conditions;

•

lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods;

•

environmental hazards or liabilities; and

•

shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery
    of equipment.

A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in
    a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular
    property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful
    in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an
    adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
    condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling
    activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves
    greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons.



Industry
    Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be
    Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent
    oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases
    and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel
    required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
    is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs.
    Typically, during times of high or rising commodity prices,
    drilling and operating costs will also increase. Higher prices
    will also generally increase the costs of properties available
    for acquisition. Certain of our competitors have financial and
    other resources substantially larger than ours. They also may
    have established strategic long-term positions and relationships
    in areas in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we
    may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling
    rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a
    competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect
    demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide
    price and production levels, the cost and availability of
    alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations.

Midstream
    Capacity Constraints and Interruptions Impact Commodity
    Sales

We rely on midstream facilities and systems to process our
    natural gas production and to transport our production to
    downstream markets. Such midstream systems include the systems
    we operate, as well as systems operated by a number of different
    third parties. When possible, we gain access to midstream
    systems that provide the most advantageous downstream market
    prices available to us.

Regardless of who operates the midstream systems we rely upon, a
    portion of our production in any region may be interrupted or
    shut in from time to time due to loss of access to plants,
    pipelines or gathering systems. Such access could be lost due to
    a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather
    conditions, accidents, field labor issues or strikes.
    Additionally, we and third-parties may be subject to constraints
    that limit our ability to construct, maintain or repair
    midstream facilities needed to process and transport our
    production. Such interruptions or constraints could negatively
    impact our production and associated profitability.

Hedging
    Activities Limit Participation in Commodity Price Increases and
    Increase Exposure to Counterparty Credit Risk

We periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a
    portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and
    NGL price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk
    management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price
    declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits
    of commodity price increases above the prices established by our
    hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may
    expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain
    circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties
    to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts.

Public
    Policy, Which Includes Laws, Rules and Regulations, Can
    Change

Our operations are generally subject to federal laws, rules and
    regulations in the United States and Canada. In addition, we are
    also subject to the laws and regulations of various states,
    provinces, tribal and local governments. Pursuant to public
    policy changes, numerous government departments and agencies
    have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil
    and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry
    substantial penalties for failure to comply. Changes in such
    public policy have affected, and at times in the future could
    affect, our operations. Political developments can restrict
    production levels, enact price controls, change environmental
    protection requirements, and increase taxes, royalties and other
    amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies.
    Existing laws and regulations can also require us to incur
    substantial costs to maintain regulatory compliance. Our
    operating and other compliance costs could increase further if
    existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if
    new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.
    Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and
    regulations, such changes could significantly impact our
    profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly
    changes related to hydraulic fracturing, income taxes and
    climate change as discussed below.



Hydraulic Fracturing

— The U.S. Congress
    is currently considering legislation to amend the federal Safe
    Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used
    by the oil and natural-gas industry in the hydraulic-fracturing
    process. Currently, regulation of hydraulic fracturing is
    primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and
    other compliance requirements. This legislation, if adopted,
    could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting
    at the federal level.

Income Taxes

— The U.S. President’s
    recent budget proposals include provisions that would, if
    enacted, make significant changes to United States tax laws. The
    most significant change would eliminate the immediate deduction
    for intangible drilling and development costs.

Climate Change

— Policy makers in the United
    States are increasingly focusing on whether the emissions of
    greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are
    contributing to harmful climatic changes. Policy makers at both
    the United States federal and state level have introduced
    legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to
    quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through
    inventories and limitations on greenhouse gas emissions.
    Legislative initiatives to date have focused on the development
    of

cap-and-trade

programs. These programs generally would cap overall greenhouse
    gas emissions on an economy-wide basis and require major sources
    of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire
    and surrender emission allowances.

Cap-and-trade

programs would be relevant to our operations because the
    equipment we use to explore for, develop, produce and process
    oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases. Additionally, the
    combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as the oil, gas and NGLs
    we sell, emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Environmental
    Matters and Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal and
    local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials
    into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and
    regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for
    the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from our operations in affected areas. Any future
    environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the
    environment are uncertain and will be governed by several
    factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.
    There is no assurance that changes in or additions to public
    policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have
    a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Insurance
    Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration, development, production and processing of oil, gas
    and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrence
    including, but not limited to blowouts, cratering, fires and
    loss of well control. These occurrences can result in damage to
    or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to
    persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment.
    We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in
    accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that
    management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against
    all operational risks is not available to us.

International
    Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic and Other
    Risks

Our operations outside North America are based in Brazil and
    Angola. As noted earlier in this report, we are in the process
    of divesting our operations outside North America. However,
    until we cease operating in these locations, we face political
    and economic risks and other uncertainties in these areas that
    are more prevalent than what exist for our operations in North
    America. Such factors include, but are not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;



•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency
    because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. These assets may affect our overall business and
    results of operations by distracting management’s attention
    from our more significant assets. Various regions of the world
    have a history of political and economic instability. This
    instability could result in new governments or the adoption of
    new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile
    attitude toward foreign investment. In an extreme case, such a
    change could result in termination of contract rights and
    expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This could adversely
    affect our interests and our future profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

Certain
    of Our Investments Are Subject To Risks That May Affect Their
    Liquidity and Value

To maximize earnings on available cash balances, we periodically
    invest in securities that we consider to be short-term in nature
    and generally available for short-term liquidity needs. During
    2007, we purchased asset-backed securities that have an auction
    rate reset feature (“auction rate securities”). Our
    auction rate securities generally have contractual maturities of
    more than 20 years. However, the underlying interest rates
    on our securities are scheduled to reset every seven to
    28 days. Therefore, when we bought these securities, they
    were generally priced and subsequently traded as short-term
    investments because of the interest rate reset feature. At
    December 31, 2010, our auction rate securities totaled
    $94 million.

Since February 8, 2008, we have experienced difficulty
    selling our securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism, which provided liquidity to these securities. An
    auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
    securities could not do so. The securities for which auctions
    have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned
    every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. Due to
    continued auction failures throughout 2009 and 2010, we consider
    these investments to be long-term in nature and generally not
    available for short-term liquidity needs. Therefore, we have
    classified these investments as other long-term assets.

Our auction rate securities are rated AAA — the
    highest rating — by one or more rating agencies and
    are collateralized by student loans that are substantially
    guaranteed by the United States government. These investments
    are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest
    rate risks, which may be exacerbated by problems in the global
    credit markets, including but not limited to, U.S. subprime
    mortgage defaults and writedowns by major financial institutions
    due to deteriorating values of their asset portfolios. These and
    other



related factors have affected various sectors of the financial
    markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. If issuers are
    unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit
    ratings deteriorate, our ability to liquidate these securities
    and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the
    near term may be limited. Under such circumstances, we may
    record an impairment charge on these investments in the future.

Properties

Property
    Overview

Our oil and gas operations are concentrated within various North
    American onshore basins across the United States and Canada. Our
    properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped oil
    and gas leases and mineral acreage in these regions. These
    ownership interests entitle us to drill for and produce oil,
    natural gas and NGLs from specific areas. Our interests are
    mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent,
    overriding royalty, mineral, and other forms of direct and
    indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

As previously mentioned, we have completed substantially all of
    our offshore divestitures, with the exception of assets in
    Brazil and Angola. We have entered into agreements to sell these
    assets and are waiting for the respective governments to approve
    the divestitures.

We also have a substantial midstream business that includes
    natural gas and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems
    across North America. In aggregate, we have ownership in
    approximately 13,000 miles of pipeline and 65 natural gas
    processing and treating plants. Our most significant
    concentration of midstream assets is located in north Texas at
    our Barnett Shale field. These assets include over
    3,000 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants
    with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a
    15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. In 2010, we completed
    construction of a natural gas processing plant to support the
    growing development of our Cana-Woodford Shale properties. The
    Cana plant has an initial capacity of 200 MMcf per day with
    the design capacity to expand up to 600 MMcf per day.

Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline
    transportation system in Canada. This

220-mile

dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in
    Alberta with connectivity to a 350 MBbls storage terminal
    near Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to deliver
    diluents to Jackfish for the blending of our heavy oil
    production and transport the combined product to the Edmonton
    crude oil market for sale. We have a 50% ownership interest in
    the Access Pipeline.



The following sections provide additional details of our oil and
    gas properties, including information about proved reserves,

Percentage of proved reserves and production the property bears
    to total proved reserves and production based on actual figures
    and not the rounded figures included in this table.

The following profile information includes the location,
    acreage, formation type, average working interest and 2010
    drilling activities of our key properties presented in the table
    above. Due to the continued depressed natural gas price
    environment, we are shifting the vast majority of our 2011
    drilling activity to focus on the oil and liquids-rich gas
    properties within our portfolio. For the key properties that are
    primarily liquids-based, we also provide our 2011 drilling plans
    in the profile information below.

U.S.

Barnett Shale

— The Barnett Shale, located in
    north Texas, is our largest property both in terms of production
    and proved reserves. Our leases include approximately
    630,000 net acres located primarily in Denton, Johnson,
    Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties. The Barnett Shale is a
    non-conventional reservoir and it



produces natural gas and NGLs. We have an average working
    interest of 89%. We drilled 460 gross wells in 2010 and
    plan to drill approximately 320 gross wells in 2011.

Carthage

— The Carthage area in east Texas
    includes primarily Harrison, Marion, Panola and Shelby counties.
    Our average working interest is 86% and we hold approximately
    225,000 net acres. Our Carthage area wells produce
    primarily natural gas and NGLs from conventional reservoirs. We
    drilled 26 gross wells in 2010 in this area.

Cana-Woodford Shale

— The Cana-Woodford Shale
    is located primarily in Canadian, Blaine, Caddo, and Dewey
    counties in western Oklahoma. Our average working interest is
    52% and we hold more than 240,000 net acres. Our
    Cana-Woodford Shale properties produce natural gas, NGLs and
    condensate from a non-conventional reservoir. We drilled
    87 gross wells in 2010 and plan to drill around
    220 gross wells in 2011.

Permian Basin

— Our oil and gas properties in
    the Permian Basin in west Texas and southeast New Mexico
    comprise approximately 950,000 net acres. Our drilling
    activity is targeting the liquids-rich targets within the Avalon
    Shale, Bone Spring, Wolfberry and undisclosed play types within
    other conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest in
    these properties is 53%. In 2010, we drilled 262 gross
    wells and plan to drill approximately 300 gross wells in
    2011.

Washakie

— Our Washakie area leases are
    concentrated in Carbon and Sweetwater counties in southern
    Wyoming. Our average working interest is about 76% and we hold
    about 160,000 net acres in the area. The Washakie wells
    produce primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs. In
    2010, we drilled 93 gross wells.

Arkoma-Woodford Shale

— Our Arkoma-Woodford
    Shale properties in southeastern Oklahoma produce natural gas
    and NGLs from a non-conventional reservoir. Our more than
    55,000 net acres are concentrated in Coal and Hughes
    counties, and we have an average working interest of about 31%.
    In 2010, we drilled 61 gross wells in this area.

Groesbeck

— The Groesbeck area of east Texas
    includes portions of Freestone, Leon, Limestone and Robertson
    counties. Our average working interest is 72% and we hold about
    130,000 net acres of land. The Groesbeck wells produce
    primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs. In 2010, we
    drilled 20 gross wells in this area.

Granite Wash

— The Granite Wash is concentrated
    in Hemphill and Wheeler counties in the Texas Panhandle and in
    western Oklahoma. Our average working interest is approximately
    48% and we hold approximately 60,000 net acres of land. The
    Granite Wash wells produce liquids and natural gas from
    conventional reservoirs. In 2010, we drilled 29 gross wells
    in this area and plan to drill approximately 55 gross wells
    in 2011.

Haynesville-Bossier Shale

— Our Haynesville
    Shale acreage position spans across east Texas and north
    Louisiana with an average working interest of 92%. To date, our
    drilling activity has been focused on approximately
    150,000 acres located in Panola, Shelby and
    San Augustine counties in east Texas. We drilled
    23 gross wells in 2010.

Canada

Jackfish

— Jackfish is our 100%-owned thermal
    heavy oil project in the non-conventional oil sands of east
    central Alberta. We are employing steam-assisted gravity
    drainage at Jackfish. The first phase of Jackfish is fully
    operational with a gross facility capacity of 35 MBbls per
    day. We expect this project to maintain a flat production
    profile for greater than 20 years at an average net
    production rate of approximately

25-30 MBbls

per day. We have completed construction of the second phase of
    Jackfish and we have filed a regulatory application for a third
    phase. The second and third phases of Jackfish are each expected
    to eventually produce approximately 30 MBbls per day of
    heavy oil production net of royalties over the life of the
    projects.

Northwest

— The Northwest region includes
    acreage within west central Alberta and northeast British
    Columbia. We hold approximately 1.9 million net acres in
    the region, which produces primarily natural gas



from conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest in
    the area is approximately 73%. In 2010, we drilled 67 gross
    wells and plan to drill about 50 gross wells in 2011.

Lloydminster

— Our Lloydminster properties are
    located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and
    western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by
    conventional means without steam injection. We hold
    2.4 million net acres and have an 89% average working
    interest in our Lloydminster properties. In 2010, we drilled
    181 gross wells and plan to drill a similar amount of gross
    wells in 2011.

Deep Basin

— Our properties in Canada’s
    Deep Basin include portions of west central Alberta and east
    central British Columbia. We hold approximately 520,000 net
    acres in the Deep Basin. The area produces natural gas and
    liquids from conventional reservoirs. Our average working
    interest in the Deep Basin is 43%. In 2010, we drilled
    39 gross wells and plan to drill approximately
    30 gross wells in 2011.

Horn River Basin

— The Horn River Basin,
    located in northeast British Columbia, is a non-conventional gas
    reservoir targeting the Devonian Shale. Our leases include
    approximately 170,000 net acres with a 100% working
    interest. We drilled 7 gross wells in 2010.

Pike

— Our 50%-owned Pike oil sands acreage is
    situated directly to the south of our Jackfish acreage in east
    central Alberta. This position was attained in 2010 through a
    joint venture agreement with BP. The Pike leasehold is currently
    undeveloped and has no proved reserves or production as of
    December 31, 2010. We began appraisal drilling near the end
    of 2010 and are acquiring seismic data. The drilling results and
    seismic will help us determine the optimal configuration for the
    initial phase of development. We expect to begin the regulatory
    application process for the first Pike phase around the end of
    2011.

Preparation
    of Reserves Estimates and Reserves Audits

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas,
    which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
    estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
    producible from known reservoirs under existing economic
    conditions, operating methods and government regulations. To be
    considered proved, oil and gas reserves must be economically
    producible before contracts providing the right to operate
    expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably
    certain. Also, the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have
    commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it
    will commence the project within a reasonable time.

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment as discussed in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As a result, we have
    developed internal policies for estimating and recording
    reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved
    reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
    guidance. Our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in
    reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the
    “Group”). These same policies also require that
    reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves
    estimators (“Qualified Estimators”), as defined by the
    Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards.

The Group, which is led by Devon’s Director of Reserves and
    Economics, is responsible for the internal review and
    certification of reserves estimates. We ensure the Group’s
    Director and key members of the Group have appropriate technical
    qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates.
    Such qualifications include any or all of the following:

•

an undergraduate degree in petroleum engineering from an
    accredited university, or equivalent;

•

a petroleum engineering license, or similar certification;

•

memberships in oil and gas industry or trade groups; and

•

relevant experience estimating reserves.

The current Director of the Group has all of the qualifications
    listed above. The current Director has been involved with
    reserves estimation in accordance with SEC definitions and
    guidance since 1987. He has experience in reserves estimation
    for projects in the United States (both onshore and offshore),
    as well as in Canada, Asia, the Middle East and South America.
    He has been employed by Devon for the past ten years,



including the past three in his current position as Director of
    Reserves and Economics. During his career with Devon and others,
    he was the primary reservoir engineer for projects including,
    but not limited to:

•

Hugoton Gas Field (Kansas)

•

Sho-Vel-Tum
    CO


Flood (Oklahoma)

•

West Loco Hills Unit Waterflood and
    CO


Flood (New Mexico)

•

Dagger Draw Oil Field (New Mexico)

•

Clarke Lake Gas Field (Alberta, Canada)

•

Panyu 4-2 and 5-1 Joint Development (Offshore South China Sea)

•

ACG Unit (Caspian Sea)

As the primary reservoir engineer, he was responsible for
    reserves estimation on each of these projects. These reserves
    estimates were utilized internally and for SEC filings.

From 2003 to 2010, he served as the reservoir engineering
    representative on our internal Peer Review Team, reviewing
    reserves and resource estimates for projects including, but not
    limited to:

•

Mobile Bay Norphlet Discoveries (Gulf of Mexico Shelf)

•

Cascade Lower Tertiary Development (Gulf of Mexico Deepwater)

•

Polvo Development (Campos Basin, Brazil)

Additionally, the Group reports independently of any of our
    operating divisions. The Group’s Director reports to our
    Vice President of Budget and Reserves, who reports to our Chief
    Financial Officer. No portion of the Group’s compensation
    is directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
    operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
    reserves that are audited include major fields and major
    additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group
    reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum
    consultants discussed below. The Group also ensures our
    Qualified Estimators obtain continuing education related to the
    fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.

The Group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed
    by third-party consulting firms. During 2010, we engaged two
    such firms to audit a significant portion of our proved
    reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the 2010
    reserve estimates for 94% of our U.S. onshore properties.
    AJM Petroleum Consultants audited 89% of our Canadian reserves.

Set forth below is a summary of the North American reserves that
    were evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2010, 2009 and
    2008.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by our employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. The Society of Petroleum
    Engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a
    company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by
    an independent petroleum



consultant that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an
    opinion as to whether such estimates, in aggregate, are
    reasonable and have been estimated and presented in conformity
    with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation
    methods and procedures.

In addition to conducting these internal and external reviews,
    we also have a Reserves Committee that consists of three
    independent members of our Board of Directors. This committee
    provides additional oversight of our reserves estimation and
    certification process. The Reserves Committee assists the Board
    of Directors with its duties and responsibilities in evaluating
    and reporting our proved reserves, much like our Audit Committee
    assists the Board of Directors in supervising our audit and
    financial reporting requirements. Besides being independent, the
    members of our Reserves Committee also have educational
    backgrounds in geology or petroleum engineering, as well as
    experience relevant to the reserves estimation process.

The Reserves Committee meets a minimum of twice a year to
    discuss reserves issues and policies, and meets separately with
    our senior reserves engineering personnel and our independent
    petroleum consultants at those meetings. The responsibilities of
    the Reserves Committee include the following:

•

approve the scope of and oversee an annual review and evaluation
    of our consolidated oil, gas and NGL reserves;

•

oversee the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting
    system;

•

oversee and evaluate, prepare and disclose our compliance with
    legal and regulatory requirements related to our oil, gas and
    NGL reserves;

•

review the qualifications and independence of our independent
    engineering consultants; and

•

monitor the performance of our independent engineering
    consultants.

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the
    relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids
    reserves are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.



No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or
    included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental
    authority or agency since the beginning of 2010 except in
    filings with the SEC and the Department of Energy
    (“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC
    correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein.
    Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same
    underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates
    of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires
    reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we
    operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not
    operate.

Proved
    Developed Reserves

As presented in the previous table, we had 2,042 MMBoe of
    proved developed reserves at December 31, 2010. Proved
    developed reserves consist of proved developed producing
    reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The

Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2010


At December 31, 2010, we had 831 MMBoe of proved
    undeveloped reserves. This represents a 2% increase as compared
    to 2009 and represents 29% of our total proved reserves. A large
    contributor to the increase was our 2010 drilling activities,
    which increased our proved undeveloped reserves 145 MMBoe.
    The divestiture of our Gulf of Mexico properties reduced our
    proved undeveloped reserves by 39 MMBoe.

As a result of 2010 development activities, we converted
    91 MMBoe, or 11%, of the 2009 proved undeveloped reserves
    to proved developed reserves. This conversion rate implies a
    nine-year development cycle, which exceeds the five-year general
    guideline for recording proved undeveloped reserves. However,
    our



overall proved undeveloped conversion rate is largely impacted
    by the pace of development at Jackfish. Excluding our Jackfish
    reserves, our 2010 proved undeveloped conversion rate implies a
    development cycle that approximates five years.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our Jackfish proved
    undeveloped reserves were 396 MMBoe and 351 MMBoe,
    respectively. Development schedules for the Jackfish reserves
    are primarily controlled by the need to keep the processing
    plants at their full capacity of 35,000 barrels of oil per
    day per facility. Processing plant capacity is controlled by
    factors such as total steam processing capacity, steam-oil
    ratios and air quality discharge permits. As a result, these
    reserves will remain classified as proved undeveloped for more
    than five years. Currently, the development schedule for these
    reserves extends though the year 2025. We have made significant
    funding commitments toward the development of the Jackfish
    reserves.

See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report for further discussion
    of the contributions by project area of all changes to total
    proved reserves.

Proved
    Reserves Cash Flows

The following table presents estimated cash flow information
    related to our December 31, 2010 estimated proved reserves.
    Similar to reserves, the cash flow estimates correspond with the

Estimated pre-tax future net revenue represents estimated future
    revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves,
    net of estimated production and development costs and site
    restoration and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not
    give effect to depreciation, depletion and amortization, or to
    non-property related expenses such as debt service and income
    tax expense.

Future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent
    the average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the

12-month

period prior to December 31, 2010. These prices were not
    changed except where different prices were fixed and
    determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions
    yielded average prices over the life of our properties of $59.94
    per Bbl of oil, $3.73 per Mcf of gas and $31.11 per Bbl of NGLs.
    The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
    attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect
    market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to
    December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance that all of
    the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods

    gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the
    relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids
    reserves are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.

Operation
    of Properties

The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the
    responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or
    operating agreements. The operator supervises production,
    maintains production records, employs field personnel and
    performs other functions.

We are the operator of 23,056 of our wells. As operator, we
    receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
    performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing
    and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
    in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the
    monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
    administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.



Title to
    Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
    customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
    not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We
    believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the
    value of such properties or from the respective interests
    therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
    of the business.

As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
    of local records, little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
    Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of
    outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an
    acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of
    drilling operations on undeveloped properties.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental
    to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the date of
    this report, there were no material pending legal proceedings to
    which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject.

Overview
    of Business

Devon is one of North America’s leading independent oil and
    gas exploration and production companies. Our operations are
    focused in the United States and Canada. We also own natural gas
    pipelines and treatment facilities in many of our producing
    areas, making us one of North America’s larger processors
    of natural gas liquids.

As an enterprise, we strive to optimize value for our
    shareholders by growing cash flows, earnings, production and
    reserves, all on a per debt-adjusted share basis. We accomplish
    this by replenishing our reserves and production and managing
    other key operational elements that drive our success. These
    items are discussed more fully below.

•

Reserves and production growth

— Our financial
    condition and profitability are significantly affected by the
    amount of proved reserves we own. Oil and gas properties are our
    most significant assets, and the reserves that relate to such
    properties are key to our future success. To increase our proved
    reserves, we must replace quantities produced with additional
    reserves from successful exploration and development activities
    or property acquisitions. Additionally, our profitability and
    operating cash flows are largely dependent on the amount of oil,
    gas and NGLs we produce. Growing production from existing
    properties is difficult because the rate of production from oil
    and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.
    As a result, we constantly drill for and develop reserves on
    properties that provide a balance of near-term and long-term
    production. In addition, we may acquire properties with proved
    reserves that we can develop and subsequently produce to help
    create value.

•

Capital investment discipline

— Effectively
    deploying our resources into capital projects is key to
    maintaining and growing future production and oil and gas
    reserves. As a result, we have historically deployed virtually
    all our available cash flow into capital projects. Therefore,
    maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in capital
    projects is important to our profitability and financial
    condition. Our ability to control capital expenditures can be
    affected by changes in commodity prices. During times of high
    commodity prices, drilling and related costs often escalate due
    to the effects of supply versus demand economics. The inverse is
    also true.

•

High return projects

— We seek to invest our
    capital resources into projects where we can generate the
    highest risk-adjusted investment returns. One factor that can
    have a significant impact on such returns is our drilling
    success. Combined with appropriate revenue and cost-management
    strategies,



high drilling success rates are important to generating
    competitive returns on our capital investment. During 2010, we
    drilled 1,588 gross wells and 99% of those were successful.
    This success rate is similar to our drilling achievements in
    recent years, demonstrating a proven track record of success. By
    accomplishing high drilling success rates, we provide an
    inventory of reserves growth and a platform of opportunities on
    our undrilled acreage that can be profitably developed.

•

Reserves and production balance

— As evidenced
    by history, commodity prices are inherently volatile. In
    addition, oil and gas prices often diverge due to a variety of
    circumstances. Consequently, we value a balance of reserves and
    production between gas and liquids that can add stability to our
    revenue stream when either commodity price is under pressure.
    Our production mix in 2010 was approximately 68% gas and 32% oil
    and NGLs such as propane, butane and ethane. Our year-end
    reserves were approximately 60% gas and 40% liquids. With
    planned future growth in oil from Jackfish, Pike and other
    projects, combined with an inventory of shale natural gas plays,
    we expect to maintain this balance in the future.

•

Operating cost controls

— To maintain our
    competitive position, we must control our lease operating costs
    and other production costs. As reservoirs are depleted and
    production rates decline, per unit production costs will
    generally increase and affect our profitability and operating
    cash flows. Similar to capital expenditures, our ability to
    control operating costs can be affected by significant changes
    in commodity prices. Our base production is focused in core
    areas of our operations where we can achieve economies of scale
    to help manage our operating costs.

•

Marketing and midstream performance improvement

— We enhance the value of our oil and gas
    operations with our marketing and midstream business. By
    efficiently gathering and processing oil, gas and NGL
    production, our midstream operations enhance our project returns
    and contribute to our strategies to grow reserves and production
    and manage expenditures. Additionally, by effectively marketing
    our production, we maximize the prices received for our oil, gas
    and NGL production in relation to market prices. This is
    important because our profitability is highly dependent on
    market prices. These prices are determined primarily by market
    conditions. Market conditions for these products have been, and
    will continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide
    economic and political conditions, weather, supply disruptions
    and other local market conditions that are beyond our control.
    To manage this volatility, we utilize financial hedging
    arrangements. As of February 10, 2011, approximately 29% of
    our 2011 gas production is associated with financial price swaps
    and fixed-price physicals. We also have basis swaps associated
    with 0.2 Bcf per day of our 2011 gas production.
    Additionally, approximately 36% of our 2011 oil production is
    associated with financial price collars. We also have call
    options that, if exercised, would relate to an additional 16% of
    our 2011 oil production.

•

Financial flexibility preservation

— As
    mentioned, commodity prices have been and will continue to be
    volatile and will continue to impact our profitability and cash
    flow. We understand this fact and manage our debt levels
    accordingly to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility.
    We generally operate within the cash flow generated by our
    operations. However, during periods of low commodity prices, we
    may use our balance sheet strength to access debt or equity
    markets, allowing us to preserve our business and maintain
    momentum until markets recover. When prices improve, we can
    utilize excess operating cash flow to repay debt and invest in
    our activities that not only maintain but also increase value
    per share.

Overview
    of 2010 Results

2010 was an outstanding year for Devon. We reported record
    net earnings and reserves and made significant progress on our
    offshore divestiture program announced in November 2009. We sold
    our properties in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan, China and
    other International regions, generating $5.6 billion in
    after-tax proceeds and after-tax gains of $1.7 billion.
    Additionally, we have entered into agreements to sell our
    remaining offshore assets in Brazil and Angola and are waiting
    for the respective governments to approve the



divestitures. Once the pending transactions are complete, we
    expect to have generated more than $8 billion in after-tax
    proceeds from all our divestitures.

These divestitures have allowed us to begin focusing entirely on
    our North American Onshore oil and natural gas portfolio. We
    grew North American Onshore production 1% in 2010 and replaced
    approximately 175% of our production with the drill bit at very
    attractive costs. The operational success we had with the drill
    bit increased our reserves to 2,873 MMBoe, the highest
    level in our history.

While our total North American Onshore production grew 1% in
    2010, our oil and NGL production increased 6% over 2009. Liquids
    prices began to stabilize in 2009 and continued to strengthen
    throughout 2010. Although our realized price for gas increased
    17% in 2010, gas prices continue to be weak. Considering the
    current and expected trends in commodity pricing, we have
    leveraged the value of our balanced portfolio and shifted
    capital spending toward the more profitable liquids-rich
    development opportunities currently available to us. The
    performance of these assets and higher price realizations are
    reflected in the 2010 earnings increase.

Key measures of our performance for 2010, as well as certain
    operational developments, are summarized below:

•

North America Onshore oil and NGL production grew 6% over 2009,
    to 71 million Boe.

•

North American Onshore gas production decreased 1% compared with
    2009, to 152 million Boe.

•

The combined realized price for oil, gas and NGLs per Boe
    increased 22% to $31.91.

•

Oil, gas and NGL derivatives generated net gains of
    $811 million in 2010, including cash receipts of
    $888 million.

•

Per unit lease operating costs increased 4% to $7.42 per Boe.

•

Operating cash flow increased to $5.5 billion, representing
    a 16% increase over 2009.

•

Capitalized costs incurred in our oil and gas activities were
    $6.5 billion in 2010. This includes $1.2 billion for
    unproved acreage acquisitions.

•

Reserves increased to 2,873 MMBoe, an all-time high.

From an operational perspective, we completed another successful
    year with the drill-bit. We drilled 1,584 gross wells on
    our North America Onshore properties with a 99% success rate and
    grew our related proved reserves 9%.

During 2010, we more than doubled our industry-leading leasehold
    position in the liquids-rich Cana-Woodford shale play in western
    Oklahoma to more than 240,000 net acres. This allowed us to
    grow production more than 210% from the end of 2009 to the end
    of 2010. As a result of the success of our drilling and
    development efforts in the Cana-Woodford shale, we also
    constructed a gas processing plant in 2010.

In the Barnett Shale, we exited 2010 with production of
    1.2 Bcfe per day, which includes 43 MBbls per day of
    liquids production. This represents a 16% increase in total
    production compared to the 2009 exit rate.

In the Permian Basin, we continued to assemble additional
    liquids-rich acreage. By the end of 2010, we had approximately
    one million net acres on liquids-rich development opportunities
    which led to an increase in production of 16% from the end of
    2009 to the end of 2010.

Our net production from our Jackfish oil sands project in Canada
    averaged 25 MBbls per day. Jackfish continues to be one of
    Canada’s most successful steam-assisted gravity drainage
    projects. Construction of our second Jackfish project is now
    complete. We expect to have first oil production by the end of
    2011. Additionally, we applied for regulatory approval of a
    third phase of Jackfish in 2010.

During 2010, we used a portion of our offshore divestiture
    proceeds to invest $1.2 billion in unproved leasehold
    acquisition focused on oil and liquids-rich gas plays. Our most
    significant single investment was our $500 million
    acquisition of a 50% interest in the Pike oil sands. The Pike
    acreage lies immediately adjacent to



the Jackfish project. We began appraisal drilling at Pike near
    the end of 2010 and are acquiring seismic data. The drilling
    results and seismic will help us determine the optimal
    configuration for the initial phase of development. We expect to
    begin the regulatory application process for the first Pike
    phase around the end of 2011.

Our performance and offshore divestiture success throughout 2010
    enabled us to end the year with a robust level of liquidity. At
    the end of 2010, we had $3.4 billion of cash and short-term
    investments and $2.6 billion of available credit.

Business
    and Industry Outlook

Even though we possess a great deal of financial strength and
    flexibility, we are fully committed to exercising capital
    discipline, maximizing profits, maintaining balance sheet
    strength and optimizing growth per debt-adjusted share. Our
    portfolio of assets provides a great deal of investment
    flexibility. At the end of 2010, our proved reserves were
    comprised of approximately 60% gas and 40% liquids. While gas
    prices remain challenged in the market, our near-term focus is
    on the oil and liquids-rich opportunities that exist within our
    balanced portfolio of properties. As a result, the vast majority
    of our 2011 drilling activity will be centered on our oil and
    liquids-rich gas properties. Should the outlook for commodity
    prices change, we have the flexibility to redirect our capital
    to ensure we continually focus on the highest-return assets in
    our portfolio.

Our ability to leverage the depth and breadth of our existing
    portfolio of properties will be key to the successful execution
    of our growth and value-creation objectives. With
    2.9 billion Boe of proved reserves at the end of 2010, our
    North American onshore assets will provide many years of
    visible, economic growth and a good balance between liquids and
    natural gas. In 2011, we are targeting a 6-8% production
    increase. However, we expect this growth will be driven by oil
    and NGLs growth of at least 16%. Additionally, we will continue
    to use a portion of our offshore divestiture proceeds to
    repurchase common stock under our $3.5 billion share
    repurchase program. Therefore, our 2011 production growth will
    be even higher on a per debt-adjusted share basis.

Results
    of Operations

As previously stated, we are in the process of divesting our
    offshore assets. As a result, all amounts in this document
    related to our International operations are presented as
    discontinued. Therefore, the production, revenue and expense
    amounts presented in this “Results of Operations”
    section exclude amounts related to our International assets
    unless otherwise noted.

Even though we have divested our U.S. Offshore operations,
    these properties do not qualify as discontinued operations under
    accounting rules. As such, financial and operating data provided
    in this document that pertain to our continuing operations
    include amounts related to our U.S. Offshore operations. To
    facilitate comparisons of our ongoing operations subsequent to
    the planned divestitures, we have presented amounts related to
    our U.S. Offshore assets separate from those of our North
    American Onshore assets where appropriate.

Oil
    Sales

2010 vs. 2009

Oil sales increased $557 million as a
    result of a 27% increase in our realized price. The largest
    contributor to the increase in our realized price was the
    increase in the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate index
    price over the same time period.

Oil sales decreased $67 million due to a three percent
    decrease in production. The decrease was comprised of the net
    effects of a 62% decrease in our U.S. Offshore production
    and a five percent increase in our North America Onshore
    production. The decrease in our U.S. Offshore production
    was primarily due to the divestiture of such properties in the
    second quarter of 2010. The increased North America Onshore
    production resulted primarily from continued development of our
    Permian Basin properties in Texas and our Jackfish thermal heavy
    oil project in Canada.

2009 vs. 2008

Oil sales decreased $1.3 billion as a
    result of a 38% decrease in our realized price without hedges.
    The largest contributor to the decrease in our realized price
    was the decrease in the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate
    index price over the same time period.

Oil sales increased $258 million due to a three million
    barrel, or 8%, increase in production. The increased production
    resulted primarily from the continued development of Jackfish in
    Canada.

Gas
    Sales

2010 vs. 2009

Gas sales increased $497 million as a
    result of a 16% increase in our realized price without hedges.
    This increase was largely due to increases in the North American
    regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.

A four percent decrease in production during 2010 caused gas
    sales to decrease by $122 million. The decrease was
    primarily due to the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore
    properties in the second quarter of 2010, as well as higher
    Canadian government royalties. Also, our other North America
    Onshore properties decreased one percent due to reduced drilling
    during most of 2009 in response to lower gas prices. As a result
    of the reduced drilling activities during 2009, natural declines
    of existing wells outpaced production gains from new drilling in
    2010.

2009 vs. 2008

Gas sales decreased $4.3 billion as a
    result of a 57% decrease in our realized price without hedges.
    This decrease was largely due to decreases in the North American
    regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.

A three percent increase in production during 2009 caused gas
    sales to increase by $222 million. Our North America
    Onshore properties contributed 40 Bcf of higher volumes.
    This increase included 25 Bcf of higher production in
    Canada due to a decline in Canadian government royalties,
    resulting largely from lower gas prices. The remainder of the
    North America Onshore growth resulted from new drilling and
    development that exceeded natural production declines, primarily
    in the Barnett Shale field in north Texas. These increases were
    partially offset by 12 Bcf of lower production from our
    U.S. Offshore properties, largely resulting from natural
    production declines.

NGL
    Sales

2010 vs. 2009

NGL sales increased $254 million
    during 2010 as a result of a 32% increase in our realized price.
    The increase was largely due to an increase in the Mont Belvieu,
    Texas index price over the same time period. NGL sales increased
    $46 million in 2010 due to a six percent increase in
    production. The increase in production was primarily due to
    increased drilling in North America Onshore areas that have
    liquids-rich gas.

2009 vs. 2008

NGL sales decreased $585 million as a
    result of a 44% decrease in our realized price. This decrease
    was largely due to a decrease in the Mont Belvieu, Texas index
    price over the same time period. NGL sales increased
    $89 million in 2009 due to a seven percent increase in
    production. The increase in production is primarily due to
    drilling and development in the Barnett Shale.

Our oil, gas, and NGL derivatives include price swaps, costless
    collars and basis swaps. For the price swaps, we receive a fixed
    price for our production and pay a variable market price to the
    contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling
    price. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of
    the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various
    collars, we cash-settle the difference with the counterparty.
    For the basis swaps, we receive a fixed differential between two
    index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two
    index prices to the contract counterparty. Cash settlements
    presented in the tables above represent net realized gains or
    losses related to these various instruments.



Additionally, to facilitate a portion of our price swaps, we
    have sold gas call options for 2012 and oil call options for
    2011 and 2012. The call options give the counterparty the right
    to place us into a price swap at a predetermined fixed price.
    The terms of these call options are presented in
    “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    about Market Risk” of this report.

During 2010 and 2009, we received $888 million, or $0.96
    per Mcf, and $505 million, or $0.52 per Mcf, respectively,
    from counterparties to settle our gas derivatives. During 2008,
    we paid $424 million, or $0.46 per Mcf to counterparties to
    settle our gas derivatives and received $27 million, or
    $0.70 per Bbl from counterparties to settle our oil derivatives.
    We had no settlements on NGL derivatives in any of these periods.

In addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects, we
    also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil,
    gas and NGL derivative instruments in each reporting period. We
    estimate the fair values of these derivatives primarily by using
    internal discounted cash flow calculations. We periodically
    validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally
    generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract
    counterparties or brokers.

The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is
    our estimate of future commodity prices. We base our estimate of
    future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such
    as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments
    and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil
    instruments. Based on the amount of volumes subject to our gas
    derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2010, a
    10% increase in these forward curves would have decreased our
    2010 unrealized gains by approximately $154 million. A 10%
    increase in the forward curves associated with our oil
    derivative financial instruments would have increased our 2010
    unrealized losses by approximately $142 million. Another
    key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of
    volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily
    upon implied volatility. Finally, the amount of production
    subject to oil, gas and NGL derivatives is not a variable in our
    cash flow calculations, but it does impact the total derivative
    values.

Counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity
    derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any
    single counterparty by contracting with thirteen separate
    counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally
    require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the
    counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade.
    The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral
    must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below
    investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to
    $50 million for the majority of our contracts. As of
    December 31, 2010, the credit ratings of all our
    counterparties were investment grade.

Including the cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and
    NGL derivatives generated net gains of $811 million and
    $384 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a net
    loss of $154 million during 2008. In addition to the impact
    of cash settlements, these net gains and losses were impacted by
    new positions and settlements that occurred during each period,
    as well as the relationships between contract prices and the
    associated forward curves. A summary of our outstanding oil, gas
    and NGL derivative positions as of December 31, 2010 is
    included in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk” of this report.

All percentage changes included in this table are based on
    actual figures and not the rounded figures included in this
    table.

2010 vs. 2009

LOE increased $19 million in 2010,
    which included a $118 million increase related to our North
    America Onshore operations and a $99 million decrease
    related to our U.S. Offshore operations. North America
    Onshore LOE increased $78 million due to changes in the
    exchange rate between the U.S. and



Canadian dollars. The remainder of the increase in North America
    Onshore LOE is primarily due to increased costs related to our
    Jackfish operation in Canada. U.S. Offshore LOE decreased
    primarily due to property divestitures in the second quarter of
    2010. The increase due to exchange rates was also the main
    contributor to the changes in North America Onshore and total
    LOE per Boe.

2009 vs. 2008

LOE decreased $181 million in 2009.
    LOE dropped $182 million due to declining costs for fuel,
    materials, equipment and personnel, as well as declines in
    maintenance and well workover projects. Such declines largely
    resulted from decreasing demand for field services due to lower
    oil and gas prices. Changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. and Canadian dollar reduced LOE $49 million.
    Additionally, LOE decreased $31 million as a result of
    hurricane damages in 2008 to certain of our U.S. Offshore
    facilities and transportation systems. These factors, excluding
    the hurricane damage, were also the main contributors to the
    decrease in LOE per Boe on our North America Onshore properties.
    Production growth at our large-scale Jackfish project also
    contributed to a decrease in LOE per Boe. As Jackfish production
    approached the facility’s capacity during 2009, its

per-unit

costs declined, contributing to lower overall LOE per Boe. The
    remainder of our four percent company-wide production growth
    added $81 million to LOE during 2009.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of production
    taxes and ad valorem taxes assessed by various government
    agencies on our U.S. Onshore properties. Production taxes
    are based on a percentage of production revenues that varies by
    property and government jurisdiction. Ad valorem taxes generally
    are based on property values as determined by the government
    agency assessing the tax. The following table details the
    changes in our taxes other than income taxes.

All percentage changes included in this table are based on

    table.

2010 vs. 2009

Production taxes increased $78 million
    in 2010. This increase was largely due to higher
    U.S. Onshore revenues, as well as a decrease in production
    tax credits associated with certain properties in the state of
    Texas. Ad valorem taxes decreased $10 million primarily due
    to lower assessed values of our U.S. Onshore oil and gas
    property and equipment.

2009 vs. 2008

Production taxes decreased
    $174 million in 2009. This decrease was largely due to
    lower U.S. Onshore revenues, as well as an increase in
    production tax credits associated with certain properties in the
    state of Texas. Ad valorem taxes increased $13 million
    primarily due to higher assessed oil and gas property and
    equipment values.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties
    (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying
    the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during
    the year, by the “depletable base.” The depletable
    base represents our capitalized investment, net of accumulated
    DD&A and reductions of carrying value, plus future
    development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves.
    Generally, when reserve volumes are revised up or down, then the
    DD&A rate per unit of production will change inversely.
    However, when the depletable base changes, then the DD&A
    rate moves in the same direction. The per unit DD&A rate is
    not affected by production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A,
    as opposed to the rate per unit of production, generally moves
    in the same direction as production volumes. Oil and gas
    property DD&A is calculated separately on a

country-by-country

basis.



The changes in our production volumes, DD&A rate per unit
    and DD&A of oil and gas properties are shown in the table
    below.

2010 vs. 2009

Oil and gas property-related DD&A
    decreased $114 million during 2010 due to a six percent
    decrease in the DD&A rate. The largest contributors to the
    rate decrease were our 2010 U.S. Offshore property
    divestitures and a reduction of the carrying value of our United
    States oil and gas properties recognized in the first quarter of
    2009. This reduction totaled $6.4 billion and resulted from
    a full cost ceiling limitation. These decreases were partially
    offset by the effects of costs incurred and the transfer of
    previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of
    2010 drilling and development activities, as well as changes in
    the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.

2009 vs. 2008

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    decreased $1.2 billion due to a 40% decrease in the
    DD&A rate. The largest contributors to the rate decrease
    were reductions of the carrying values of certain of our oil and
    gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and the
    fourth quarter of 2008. These reductions totaled
    $16.3 billion and resulted from full cost ceiling
    limitations in the United States and Canada. In addition, the
    effects of changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. and Canadian dollars also contributed to the rate
    decrease. These factors were partially offset by the effects of
    costs incurred and the transfer of previously unproved costs to
    the depletable base as a result of 2009 drilling activities.
    Partially offsetting the impact from the lower 2009 DD&A
    rate was our four percent production increase, which caused oil
    and gas property related DD&A expense to increase
    $130 million.

The impact of adopting the SEC’s new

Modernization of
    Oil and Gas Reporting

rules at the end of 2009 had virtually
    no impact on our DD&A rate.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our net G&A consists of three primary components. The
    largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses
    incurred for personnel costs, office expenses, professional fees
    and other G&A items. The gross amount of these expenses is
    partially offset by two components. One is the amount of
    G&A capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of
    accounting related to exploration and development activities.
    The other is the amount of G&A reimbursed by working
    interest owners of properties for which we serve as the
    operator. These reimbursements are received during both the
    drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. The
    gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts capitalized
    and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the



consolidated statements of operations. Net G&A includes
    expenses related to oil, gas and NGL exploration and production
    activities, marketing and midstream activities, as well as
    corporate overhead activities. See the following table for a
    summary of G&A expenses by component.

    table.

2010 vs. 2009

Gross G&A decreased $120 million
    largely due to a decline in employee severance costs. Such costs
    decreased primarily due to Gulf of Mexico employees that were
    impacted by the integration of our Gulf of Mexico and
    International operations into one offshore unit in the second
    quarter of 2009 and other employee departures during 2009. Gross
    G&A, as well as capitalized G&A, also decreased
    subsequent to our mid-year 2010 Gulf of Mexico divestitures as a
    result of the decline in our workforce. The Gulf of Mexico
    divestitures were also the main contributor to the decrease in
    G&A reimbursements. Gross and capitalized G&A also
    declined due to reduced spending initiatives for certain
    discretionary cost categories. These decreases were partially
    offset by an increase due to the effects of changes in the
    exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars.

2009 vs. 2008

Gross G&A increased $4 million.
    This increase was due to approximately $60 million of
    higher costs for employee compensation and benefits, mostly
    offset by the effects of our 2009 reduced spending initiatives
    for certain discretionary cost categories.

Employee cost increases in 2009 included an additional
    $57 million of severance costs. This increase was primarily
    due to Gulf of Mexico and other employee departures during 2009.
    Additionally, postretirement benefit costs increased
    approximately $50 million. The increases in employee costs
    were partially offset by a $27 million decrease due to
    accelerated share-based compensation expense recognized in 2008
    resulting from a modification of certain executives compensation
    arrangements. The modified compensation arrangements provide
    that executives who meet certain years-of-service and age
    criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding
    share-based grants. Although this modification does not
    accelerate the vesting of the executives’ grants, it does
    accelerate the expense recognition as executives approach the
    years-of-service and age criteria.

Employee
    Severance

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized $153 million
    of estimated employee severance costs associated with the
    planned divestiture of our offshore assets that was announced in
    November 2009. This amount was based on estimates of the number
    of employees that would ultimately be impacted by the
    divestitures and included amounts related to cash severance
    costs and accelerated vesting of share-based grants. Of the
    $153 million total, $105 million related to our
    U.S. Offshore operations and the remainder related to our
    International discontinued operations.

During 2010, we divested all of our U.S. Offshore assets
    and a significant part of our International assets. As a result
    of these divestitures and associated employee terminations, we
    decreased our estimate of employee severance costs in 2010 by
    $31 million. More offshore employees than previously
    estimated received comparable positions with either the
    purchaser of the properties or in our U.S. Onshore
    operations, and this caused the $31 million decrease to our
    severance estimate. This decrease includes $27 million
    related to our U.S. Offshore operations and $4 million
    related to our International discontinued operations.

Lease
    Obligations

As a result of the divestitures discussed above, we ceased using
    certain office space that was subject to non-cancellable
    operating lease arrangements. Consequently, in 2010, we
    recognized $70 million of restructuring costs that
    represent the present value of our future obligations under the
    leases, net of anticipated sublease income. The estimate of
    lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that
    could change over the term of the leases. These estimates
    include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over
    the term of the leases, as well as the amount of variable
    operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases.

Asset
    Impairments

In 2010, we recognized $11 million of asset impairment
    charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with
    the office space we ceased using.

2010 vs. 2009

Interest based on debt outstanding
    decreased in 2010 primarily due to the retirement of
    $177 million of 10.125% notes upon their maturity in
    the fourth quarter of 2009 and the early redemption of our
    7.25% senior notes as discussed below.

Capitalized interest decreased during 2010 primarily due to the
    divestitures of our U.S. Offshore properties during the
    first half of 2010, which was partially offset by higher
    capitalized interest associated with our Canadian oil sands
    development projects.

In the second quarter of 2010, we redeemed $350 million of
    7.25% senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity of
    October 1, 2011. The notes were redeemed for
    $384 million, which represented 100 percent of the
    principal amount, a make-whole premium of $28 million and
    $6 million of accrued and unpaid interest. On the date of
    redemption, these notes also had an unamortized premium of
    $9 million. The $19 million presented



in the table above represents the net of the $28 million
    make-whole premium and $9 million amortization of the
    remaining premium.

2009 vs. 2008

Interest based on debt outstanding
    increased $11 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was
    primarily due to interest paid on the $500 million of
    5.625% senior unsecured notes and $700 million of
    6.30% senior unsecured notes that we issued in January
    2009. This was partially offset by lower interest resulting from
    the retirement of our exchangeable debentures during the third
    quarter of 2008 and lower interest rates on our floating-rate
    commercial paper borrowings.

Capitalized interest decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due
    to the sales of our West African exploration and development
    properties in 2008 and the completion of the Access pipeline
    transportation system in Canada in the second quarter of 2008.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we received cash settlements
    totaling $44 million, $40 million and $1 million,
    respectively, from counterparties to settle our interest rate
    swaps.

In addition to recognizing cash settlements, we recognize
    unrealized changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps
    each reporting period. We estimate the fair values of our
    interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using
    internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward
    interest-rate yields. We periodically validate our valuation
    techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value
    estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or
    brokers. In 2010, we recorded an unrealized loss of
    $30 million as a result of changes in interest rates. In
    2009 and 2008, we recorded unrealized gains of $66 million
    and $104 million, respectively, as a result of changes in
    interest rates.

The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is
    our estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our
    estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that
    utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds
    Rate provided by a third party. Based on the notional amount
    subject to the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2010, a
    10% increase in these forward curves would have decreased our
    2010 unrealized loss for our interest rate swaps by
    approximately $68 million.

Similar to our commodity derivative contracts, counterparty
    credit risk is also a component of interest rate derivative
    valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any single
    counterparty by contracting with seven separate counterparties.
    Additionally, our derivative contracts generally require cash
    collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s
    credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market
    exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted,
    decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment
    grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to
    $50 million for the majority of our contracts. The credit
    ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of
    December 31, 2010.



Chevron
    Common Stock and Related Embedded Option

Until October 31, 2008, we owned 14.2 million shares
    of Chevron common stock and recognized unrealized changes in the
    fair value of this investment. On October 31, 2008, we
    exchanged these shares of Chevron common stock for
    Chevron’s interest in the Drunkard’s Wash properties
    located in east-central Utah and $280 million in cash. In
    accordance with the terms of the exchange, the fair value of our
    investment in the Chevron shares was estimated to be $67.71 per
    share on the exchange date. Prior to the exchange of these
    shares, we calculated the fair value of our investment in
    Chevron common stock using Chevron’s published market price.

We also recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of the
    conversion option embedded in the debentures exchangeable into
    shares of Chevron common stock. The embedded option was not
    actively traded in an established market. Therefore, we
    estimated its fair value using quotes obtained from a broker for
    trades occurring near the valuation date.

The loss during 2008 on our investment in Chevron common stock
    was directly attributable to a $25.62 per share decrease in the
    estimated fair value while we owned Chevron’s common stock
    during the year. The gain on the embedded option during 2008 was
    directly attributable to the change in fair value of the Chevron
    common stock from January 1, 2008 to the maturity date of
    August 15, 2008.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2009 and 2008, we reduced the carrying values of certain
    of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations. A summary of these reductions and additional
    discussion is provided below.

The 2009 reduction was recognized in the first quarter and the
    2008 reductions were recognized in the fourth quarter. The
    reductions resulted from significant decreases in each
    country’s full cost ceiling compared to the immediately
    preceding quarter. The lower United States ceiling value in the
    first quarter of 2009 largely resulted from the effects of
    declining natural gas prices subsequent to December 31,
    2008. The lower ceiling values in the fourth quarter of 2008
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil, gas
    and NGL prices compared to September 30, 2008.

To demonstrate these declines, the March 31, 2009,
    December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2008 weighted

Interest and dividend income decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to
    a decrease in dividends received on our previously owned
    investment in Chevron common stock and a decrease in interest
    received on cash equivalents due to lower rates and balances.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act. The intent of this legislation was to
    encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico by
    providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain
    federal leases. Deep water leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) have contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or gas
    exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty relief would
    not be granted for that year.

In October 2007, a federal district court ruled in favor of a
    plaintiff who had challenged the legality of including price
    thresholds in deep water leases. Additionally, in January 2009 a
    federal appellate court upheld this district court ruling. This
    judgment was later appealed to the United States Supreme Court,
    which, in October 2009, declined to review the appellate
    court’s ruling. The Supreme Court’s decision ended the
    MMS’s judicial course to enforce the price thresholds.

Prior to September 30, 2009, we had $84 million
    accrued for potential royalties on various deep water leases.
    Based upon the Supreme Court’s decision, we reduced to zero
    the $84 million loss contingency accrual in the third
    quarter of 2009.

In 2008, we recognized $162 million of excess insurance
    recoveries for damages suffered in 2005 related to hurricanes
    that struck the Gulf of Mexico. The excess recoveries resulted
    from business interruption claims on policies that were in
    effect when the 2005 hurricanes occurred.

During 2010 and 2009, pursuant to the completed and planned
    divestitures of our International assets located outside North
    America, a portion of our foreign earnings were no longer deemed
    to be permanently reinvested. Accordingly, we recognized
    deferred income tax expense of $144 million and
    $55 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to
    assumed repatriations of earnings from certain of our foreign
    subsidiaries.

During 2008, we recognized $312 million of additional
    income tax expense that resulted from two related factors
    associated with our foreign operations. First, during 2008, we
    repatriated $2.6 billion from certain foreign subsidiaries
    to the United States. Second, we made certain tax policy
    election changes in the second quarter of 2008 to minimize the
    taxes we otherwise would pay for the cash repatriations, as well
    as the taxable gains associated with the sales of assets in West
    Africa. As a result of the repatriation and tax policy election
    changes, we recognized $295 million of additional current
    tax expense and $17 million of additional deferred tax
    expense. Excluding the $312 million of additional tax
    expense, our effective income tax benefit rate would have been
    34% for 2008.

2010 vs. 2009

Earnings increased $1.9 billion in
    2010 primarily as a result of the $1.5 billion gain
    ($1.5 billion after taxes) from the divestiture of our
    Azerbaijan operations and the $308 million gain
    ($235 million after taxes) from the divestiture of our
    Panyu operations in China. Also, earnings increased
    $109 million due to the 2009 reductions of carrying value
    of our oil and gas properties, which primarily related to
    Brazil. The Brazilian reduction resulted largely from an
    exploratory well drilled at the BM-BAR-3 block in the offshore
    Barreirinhas Basin. After drilling this well in the first
    quarter of 2009, we concluded that the well did not have
    adequate reserves for commercial viability. As a result, the
    seismic, leasehold and drilling costs associated with this well
    contributed to the reduction recognized in the first quarter of
    2009.

2009 vs. 2008

Earnings from discontinued operations
    decreased $617 million in 2009. Our discontinued earnings
    were impacted by several factors. First, operating revenues
    declined largely due to a 36% decrease in the price realized on
    our production, which was driven by a decline in crude oil index
    prices. Second, both operating revenues and expenses declined
    due to divestitures that closed in 2008. Earnings also decreased
    $752 million in 2009 due to larger gains recognized on West
    African asset divestitures in 2008.

Partially offsetting these decreased earnings in 2009 was the
    larger reduction of carrying value recognized in 2008 compared
    to 2009. The reductions largely consisted of full cost ceiling
    limitations related to our assets in Brazil that were caused by
    a decline in oil prices.

Operating
    Cash Flow — Continuing Operations

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flow”) continued to be a significant source of capital and
    liquidity in 2010. Changes in operating cash flow from our
    continuing operations are largely due to the same factors that
    affect our net earnings, with the exception of those earnings
    changes due to such noncash expenses as DD&A, financial
    instrument fair value changes, property impairments and deferred
    income taxes. As a result, our operating cash flow increased 19%
    during 2010 primarily due to the increase in revenues as
    discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of
    this report.



During 2010, our operating cash flow funded approximately 78% of
    our cash payments for capital expenditures. However, our capital
    expenditures for 2010 included $500 million paid to form a
    heavy oil joint venture and acquire a 50 percent interest
    in the Pike oil sands in Alberta, Canada. This acquisition was
    completed in connection with the offshore divestitures discussed
    below. Excluding this $500 million acquisition, our
    operating cash flow funded approximately 84% of our capital
    expenditures during 2010. Offshore divestiture proceeds were
    used to fund the remainder of our cash-based capital
    expenditures.

During 2009, our operating cash flow funded approximately 87% of
    our cash payments for capital expenditures. Commercial paper
    borrowings were used to fund the remainder of our cash-based
    capital expenditures. During 2008, our capital expenditures were
    primarily funded by our operating cash flow and pre-existing
    cash balances.

Other
    Sources of Cash — Continuing and Discontinued
    Operations

As needed, we supplement our operating cash flow and available
    cash by accessing available credit under our senior credit
    facility and commercial paper program. We may also issue
    long-term debt to supplement our operating cash flow while
    maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities.
    Additionally, we may acquire short-term investments to maximize
    our income on available cash balances. As needed, we reduce such
    short-term investment balances to further supplement our
    operating cash flow and available cash.

During 2010, we divested our U.S. Offshore, Azerbaijan,
    China and other minor international properties, generating
    $6.6 billion in pre-tax proceeds net of closing
    adjustments, or $5.6 billion after taxes. We have used
    proceeds from these divestitures to repay all our commercial
    paper borrowings, retire $350 million of other debt that
    was to mature in October 2011 and begin repurchasing our common
    shares. In addition, we began redeploying proceeds into our
    North America Onshore properties, including the
    $500 million Pike oil sands acquisition mentioned above.

During 2009, we issued $500 million of 5.625% senior
    unsecured notes due January 15, 2014 and $700 million
    of 6.30% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2019.
    The net proceeds received of $1.187 billion, after
    discounts and issuance costs, were used primarily to repay
    Devon’s $1.005 billion of outstanding commercial paper
    as of December 31, 2008. Subsequent to the
    $1.005 billion commercial paper repayment in January 2009,
    we utilized additional commercial paper borrowings of
    $1.431 billion to fund capital expenditures in excess of
    our operating cash flow.

During 2008, we received $2.6 billion in pre-tax proceeds,
    or $1.9 billion after taxes and purchase price adjustments
    from sales of assets located in Equatorial Guinea and other West
    African countries. Also, in conjunction with these asset sales,
    we repatriated an additional $2.6 billion of earnings from
    certain foreign subsidiaries to the United States. We used these
    combined sources of cash in 2008 to fund debt repayments, common
    stock repurchases, redemptions of preferred stock and dividends
    on common and preferred stock. Additionally, we reduced our
    short-term investment balances by $250 million and received
    $280 million from the exchange of our investment in Chevron
    common stock.



Capital
    Expenditures

Our capital expenditures are presented by geographic area and
    type in the following table. The amounts in the table below
    reflect cash payments for capital expenditures, including cash
    paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior periods. Capital
    expenditures actually incurred during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    approximately $6.9 billion, $4.7 billion and
    $10.0 billion, respectively.

Our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil
    and gas exploration and development operations, our midstream
    operations and other corporate activities. The vast majority of
    our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and
    development of oil and gas properties, which totaled
    $5.9 billion, $4.3 billion and $8.2 billion in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in exploration
    and development capital spending in 2010 was partially due to
    the $500 million Pike oil sands acquisition mentioned
    above. Additionally, with rising oil and NGL prices and proceeds
    from our offshore divestiture program, we are increasing
    drilling primarily to grow liquids production across our North
    America Onshore portfolio of properties.

The decline in capital expenditures from 2008 to 2009 was due to
    decreased drilling activities in most of our operating areas in
    response to lower commodity prices in 2009 compared to previous
    years. Also, the 2008 capital expenditures include
    $2.6 billion related to acquisitions of properties in
    Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Canada.

Capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily
    for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing
    plants, natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and oil
    pipelines. Our midstream capital expenditures in 2010 were
    largely impacted by reduced U.S. Onshore dry gas drilling
    activities.

Capital expenditures related to corporate activities increased
    in 2010. This increase is largely driven by the construction of
    our new headquarters in Oklahoma City.

Net
    Repayments of Debt

During 2010, we repaid $1.4 billion of commercial paper
    borrowings and redeemed $350 million of 7.25% senior
    notes prior to their scheduled maturity of October 1, 2011,
    primarily with proceeds received from our U.S. Offshore
    divestitures.

During 2009, we repaid our $177 million 10.125% notes
    upon maturity in the fourth quarter.

During 2008, we repaid $1.5 billion in outstanding credit
    facility borrowings primarily with proceeds received from the
    sales of assets under our African divestiture program. Also
    during 2008, virtually all holders of exchangeable debentures
    exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares
    of Chevron common stock owned by us. The debentures matured on
    August 15, 2008. In lieu of delivering our shares of
    Chevron common stock, we exercised our option to pay the
    exchanging debenture holders cash totaling $1.0 billion.
    This amount included the retirement of debentures with a book
    value of $652 million and a $379 million payment of
    the related embedded derivative option.

Redemption
    of Preferred Stock

On June 20, 2008, we redeemed all 1.5 million
    outstanding shares of our 6.49% Series A cumulative
    preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock was redeemed for
    cash at a redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends up to the redemption date.

Dividends

Devon paid common stock dividends of $281 million (or $0.64
    per share) in 2010 and $284 million (or $0.64 per share) in
    both 2009 and 2008, respectively. Devon paid dividends of
    $5 million in 2008 to preferred stockholders. Devon
    redeemed its outstanding preferred stock in the second quarter
    of 2008.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has
    been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain revolving
    lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be
    accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other
    available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance
    of equity and debt securities that can be issued pursuant to our
    automatically effective registration statement filed with the
    SEC. This registration statement can be used to offer short-term
    and long-term debt securities. Another major source of future
    liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our remaining
    offshore assets in Brazil and Angola. We estimate the
    combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund
    future capital expenditures, share repurchases, debt repayments
    and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this
    section.

Operating
    Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most
    volatile of which is pricing of the oil, gas and NGLs produced.
    Due to improving oil and NGL prices, our operating cash flow
    increased approximately 16% to $5.5 billion in 2010 as
    compared to 2009. We expect operating cash flow to continue to
    be our primary source of liquidity.

Commodity Prices

— Prices for oil, gas and NGLs
    are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions.
    Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other
    substantially variable factors influence market conditions for
    these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict,
    create volatility in oil, gas and NGL prices and are beyond our
    control. We expect this volatility to continue throughout 2011.

To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we have
    utilized various price swap, fixed-price physical delivery and
    price collar contracts to set minimum and maximum prices on our
    2011 production. As of February 10, 2011, approximately 29%
    of our 2011 gas production is associated with financial price
    swaps and fixed-price physicals. We also have basis swaps
    associated with 0.2 Bcf per day of our 2011 gas production.
    Additionally, approximately 36% of our 2011 oil production is
    associated with financial price



collars. We also have call options that, if exercised, would
    hedge an additional 16% of our 2011 oil production.

Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through
    an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity
    price increases can lead to an increase in drilling and
    development activities. As a result, the demand and cost for
    people, services, equipment and materials may also increase,
    causing a negative impact on our cash flow. However, the inverse
    is also true during periods of depressed commodity prices.

Interest Rates

— Our operating cash flow can
    also be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. As of
    February 10, 2011, we had total debt of $6.2 billion
    with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 6.4%. To
    manage our exposure to interest rate volatility, we have
    interest rate swap instruments with a total notional amount of
    $2.1 billion. These consist of instruments with a notional
    amount of $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate
    and pay a variable rate. The remaining instruments consist of
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, we will net settle these contracts in September 2011, or
    sooner should we elect, based upon us paying a fixed rate and
    receiving a floating rate. Including the effects of these swaps,
    the weighted-average interest rate related to our debt was 5.7%
    as of February 10, 2011.

Credit Losses

— Our operating cash flow is also
    exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. We are exposed to
    the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil, gas and
    NGL production. We are also exposed to credit risk related to
    the collection of receivables from our joint-interest partners
    for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects
    we operate. We are also exposed to the credit risk of
    counterparties to our derivative financial contracts as
    discussed previously in this report. We utilize a variety of
    mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our
    customers, partners and counterparties. Such mechanisms include,
    under certain conditions, posting of letters of credit,
    prepayment requirements and collateral posting requirements.

Offshore
    Divestitures

During 2010, we sold our properties in the Gulf of Mexico,
    Azerbaijan, China and other International regions, generating
    $5.6 billion in after-tax proceeds. Additionally, we have
    entered into agreements to sell our remaining offshore assets in
    Brazil and Angola and are waiting for the respective governments
    to approve the divestitures. Once the pending transactions are
    complete, we expect to have generated more than $8 billion
    in after-tax proceeds. Similar to 2010, we expect to continue
    using the divestiture proceeds to invest in North America
    Onshore exploration and development opportunities, reduce our
    debt and repurchase our common shares.

Credit
    Availability

We have a $2.65 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving
    line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”) that can
    be accessed to provide liquidity as needed. The maturity date
    for $2.19 billion of the Senior Credit Facility is
    April 7, 2013. The maturity date for the remaining
    $0.46 billion is April 7, 2012. All amounts
    outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity
    dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, we have the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at our
    election, bear interest at various fixed rate options for
    periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally less
    than the prime rate. However, we may elect to borrow at the
    prime rate.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $2.2 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a



standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the
    money market rate as found on the commercial paper market.

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial
    covenant. This covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total
    funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit
    agreement, of no more than 65%. The credit agreement defines
    total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt
    securities such as debentures, bonds, notes payable, credit
    facility borrowings and short-term commercial paper borrowings.
    In addition, total funded debt includes all obligations with
    respect to payments received in consideration for oil, gas and
    NGL production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of
    payment. Funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit
    and trade payables. The credit agreement defines total
    capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’
    equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns, such as full
    cost ceiling impairments. As of December 31, 2010, we were
    in compliance with this covenant. Our

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2010, as calculated pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, was 15.1%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility is not
    restricted under any “material adverse effect”
    clauses. It is not uncommon for credit agreements to include
    such clauses. These clauses can remove the obligation of the
    banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would
    reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on
    the borrower’s financial condition, operations, properties
    or business considered as a whole, the borrower’s ability
    to make timely debt payments, or the enforceability of material
    terms of the credit agreement. While our credit facility
    includes covenants that require us to report a condition or
    event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the
    banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the
    absence of a material adverse effect.

The following schedule summarizes the capacity of our Senior
    Credit Facility by maturity date, as well as our available
    capacity as of February 10, 2011 (in millions).

As presented in the table above, we had $625 million of
    commercial paper borrowings as of February 10, 2011.
    Although we ended 2010 with $3.4 billion of cash and
    short-term investments, the vast majority of this amount
    consists of proceeds from our International offshore
    divestitures. For the time being, we have decided not to
    repatriate these proceeds to the United States or permanently
    invest them in Canada. This decision is based on our ongoing
    evaluation of our future cash needs across our operations in the
    United States and Canada, as well as the relatively low
    borrowing rates on our short-term borrowings. If we do not
    repatriate these proceeds to the United States in the near-term,
    we may continue to increase our commercial paper borrowings to
    supplement our operating cash flow in funding our common stock
    repurchases and capital expenditures.

Debt
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the
    United States. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies
    consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
    levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
    commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
    agencies. Our current debt ratings are BBB+ with a stable
    outlook by both Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, and
    Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.



There are no “rating triggers” in any of our
    contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled
    maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level.
    Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility is
    predicated on our corporate debt rating. Therefore, even though
    a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities,
    it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings
    under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Senior
    Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the
    fully-drawn borrowing costs from LIBOR plus 35 basis points
    to a new rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. A ratings
    downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to
    economically access debt markets in the future. As of
    December 31, 2010, we were not aware of any potential
    ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our 2011 capital expenditures are expected to range from
    $5.4 billion to $6.0 billion. To a certain degree, the
    ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our
    control. Therefore, if commodity prices fluctuate from current
    estimates, we could choose to defer a portion of these planned
    2011 capital expenditures until later periods, or accelerate
    capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2011 to achieve
    the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. Based
    upon current price expectations for 2011, our existing commodity
    hedging contracts, available cash balances and credit
    availability, we anticipate having adequate capital resources to
    fund our 2011 capital expenditures.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

As a result of the success we have experienced with our offshore
    divestiture program, we announced a share repurchase program in
    May 2010. The program authorizes the repurchase of up to
    $3.5 billion of our common shares and expires December 31,
    2011. As of February 10, 2011, we had repurchased
    $1.6 billion, or 23.5 million of our shares at an
    average price of $69.60. We will continue to use proceeds from
    our offshore divestiture program in 2011 to fund our repurchase
    program.

Pension
    Funding and Estimates

Funded Status

— As compared to the projected
    benefit obligation, our qualified and nonqualified defined
    benefit plans were underfunded by $492 million and
    $448 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. A detailed reconciliation of the 2010 changes to
    our underfunded status is in Note 8 to the consolidated
    financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. Of the
    $492 million underfunded status at the end of 2010,
    $198 million is attributable to various nonqualified
    defined benefit plans that have no plan assets. However, we have
    established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of
    such nonqualified plans. As of December 31, 2010, these
    trusts had investments with a fair value of $36 million.
    The value of these trusts is in noncurrent other assets in our
    consolidated balance sheets included in “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

As compared to the accumulated benefit obligation, our qualified
    defined benefit plans were underfunded by $218 million at
    December 31, 2010. The accumulated benefit obligation
    differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former
    includes no assumption about future compensation levels.

Our funding policy regarding the qualified defined benefit plans
    is to contribute the amounts necessary for the plans’
    assets to approximately equal the present value of benefits
    earned by the participants, as calculated in accordance with the
    provisions of the Pension Protection Act. While we did have
    investment gains in 2010 and 2009, the investment losses
    experienced during 2008 significantly reduced the value of our



plans’ assets. We estimate we will contribute approximately
    $84 million to our qualified pension plans during 2011.
    However, actual contributions may be different than this amount.

Our funding policy regarding the nonqualified defined benefit
    plans is to supplement as needed the amounts accumulated in the
    related trusts with available cash and cash equivalents.

Pension Estimate Assumptions

— Our pension
    expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’
    approximate service periods and is impacted by funding decisions
    or requirements. We recognized expense for our defined benefit
    pension plans of $85 million, $119 million and
    $61 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We
    estimate that our pension expense will approximate
    $91 million in 2011. Should our actual 2011 contributions
    to qualified and nonqualified plans vary significantly from our
    current estimate of $93 million, our actual 2011 pension
    expense could vary from this estimate.

The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
    requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
    assumptions can result in different expense and liability
    amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
    We believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting
    pension expense and liabilities are the expected long-term rate
    of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
    weighted average rate of return of 6.94% and 7.18% at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We developed
    these expected long-term rate of return assumptions by
    evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. The expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of
    investment types in such assets. At December 31, 2010, the
    target allocations for plan assets were 47.5% for equity
    securities, 40% for fixed-income securities and 12.5% for other
    investment types. Equity securities consist of investments in
    large capitalization and small capitalization companies, both
    domestic and international. Fixed-income securities include
    corporate bonds of investment-grade companies from diverse
    industries, United States Treasury obligations and asset-backed
    securities. Other investment types include short-term investment
    funds and a hedge fund of funds. We expect our long-term asset
    allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation. We
    regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically
    rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when
    considered appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
    assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
    assumption of 100 basis points would increase the expected
    2011 pension expense by $6 million.

We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted
    average rate of 5.50% and 6.00% at December 31, 2010 and
    2009. The discount rate is determined at the end of each year
    based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively
    settled, considering the expected timing of future cash flows
    related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond
    yields, after allowing for call and default risk. High quality
    corporate bond yield indices are considered when selecting the
    discount rate.

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
    as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
    25 basis points would increase our pension liability at
    December 31, 2010, by $37 million, and increase
    estimated 2011 pension expense by $5 million.

At December 31, 2010, we had net actuarial losses of
    $357 million, which will be recognized as a component of
    pension expense in future years. These losses are primarily due
    to investment losses on plan assets in 2008, reductions in the
    discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages. We
    estimate that approximately $32 million and
    $26 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be
    included in pension expense in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The
    $32 million estimated to be recognized in 2011 is a
    component of the total estimated 2011 pension expense of
    $91 million referred to earlier in this section.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
    various other factors related to the participants in our defined
    benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and
    liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors
    will be in the future.



Contingencies
    and Legal Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters,
    see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known.

The critical accounting policies used by management in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those
    that are important both to the presentation of our financial
    condition and results of operations and require significant
    judgments by management with regard to estimates used. Our
    critical accounting policies and significant judgments and
    estimates related to those policies are described below. We have
    reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit
    Committee of our Board of Directors.

Full
    Cost Method of Accounting and Proved Reserves

Policy
    Description

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties. Under this method all costs associated with property
    acquisition, exploration and development activities are
    capitalized, including our internal costs that can be directly
    identified with such activities. Capitalized costs are depleted
    on an equivalent

unit-of-production

method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic
    feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is calculated using
    the capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement
    costs, plus the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in
    developing proved reserves, net of estimated salvage values.
    Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the
    depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not
    proved reserves can be assigned to such properties.

The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
    calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
    amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
    sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
    after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
    properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
    value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
    subject to amortization. If our net book value of oil and gas
    properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of
    the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an
    expense. The ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each
    country in which we have oil and gas properties. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

Our estimates of proved reserves are a major component of the
    depletion and full cost ceiling calculations. Additionally, our
    proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that
    require the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are
    forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of
    production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of
    estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves requires substantial
    judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly
    for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make
    different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same
    data. Certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited
    by outside petroleum consultants, while other reserve estimates
    are prepared by our engineers. See Note 22 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of
    the amount of our reserves that are prepared or audited by
    outside petroleum consultants.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
    regarding estimates of reserves, when revisions are made to
    prior estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
    years, annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates,
    which have been both increases and decreases in individual
    years, have averaged less



than 2% of the previous year’s estimate. However, there can
    be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be
    necessary in the future. The data for a given reservoir may also
    change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors
    including, but not limited to, additional development activity,
    evolving production history and continual reassessment of the
    viability of production under varying economic conditions.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
    judgment, the associated prices of oil, gas and NGL reserves,
    and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the
    discounted present value of the reserves do not require
    judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10% discount
    factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using
    prices that represent the average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the

12-month

period prior to the end of each quarterly period. Therefore, the
    future net revenues associated with the estimated proved
    reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or
    costs. In calculating the ceiling, we adjust the

end-of-period

price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment. This adjustment requires
    little judgment as the calculated average price is adjusted
    using the contract prices for such hedges. None of our
    outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2010
    qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that
    are not representative of future prices and requires a 10%
    discount factor, the resulting value is not indicative of the
    true fair value of the reserves. Oil and gas prices have
    historically been cyclical and, for any particular

12-month

period, can be either higher or lower than our long-term price
    forecast, which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair
    value. Therefore, oil and gas property writedowns that result
    from applying the full cost ceiling limitation, and that are
    caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the
    underlying quantities of reserves, should not be viewed as
    absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the
    related reserves.

Because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not
    possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost
    writedowns. In addition, due to the inter-relationship of the
    various judgments made to estimate proved reserves, it is
    impractical to provide quantitative analyses of the effects of
    potential changes in these estimates. However, decreases in
    estimates of proved reserves would generally increase our
    depletion rate and, thus, our depletion expense. Decreases in
    our proved reserves may also increase the likelihood of
    recognizing a full cost ceiling writedown.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Policy
    Description

We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with
    respect to a portion of our oil, gas and NGL production that
    hedge the future prices received. These instruments are used to
    manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to
    commodity price volatility. Our commodity derivative financial
    instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless
    price collars and call options. Additionally, we periodically
    enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to
    interest rate volatility. Under the terms of certain of our
    interest-rate swaps, we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable
    rate on a total notional amount. The remainder of our swaps
    represent forward starting swaps, under which we will pay a
    fixed rate and receive a floating rate on a total notional
    amount.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    For derivative financial instruments held during 2010, 2009 and
    2008, we chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify our
    derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment.
    Cash settlements with counterparties to our derivative financial
    instruments also increase or decrease earnings at the time of
    the settlement.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments
    require substantial judgment. We estimate the fair values of our
    commodity derivative financial instruments primarily by using
    internal discounted cash flow calculations. The most significant
    variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future



commodity prices. We base our estimate of future prices upon
    published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC
    Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West
    Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Another
    key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of
    volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily
    upon implied volatility. The resulting estimated future cash
    inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are
    discounted primarily using United States Treasury bill rates.
    These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the
    period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes
    in forward prices and regional price differentials.

We estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial
    instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow
    calculations based upon forward interest-rate yields. The most
    significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our
    estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our estimate of
    future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward
    curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by
    third parties. The resulting estimated future cash inflows or
    outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using
    the LIBOR and money market futures rates. These yield and
    discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the
    contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward
    interest rate yields.

We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing
    our internally generated fair value estimates with those
    obtained from contract counterparties

and/or

brokers.

In spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets,
    counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our
    cash flow calculations and derivative valuations. This is
    primarily the result of two factors. First, we have mitigated
    our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with
    numerous counterparties. Our commodity derivative contracts are
    held with thirteen separate counterparties, and our interest
    rate derivative contracts are held with seven separate
    counterparties. Second, our derivative contracts generally
    require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the
    counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment
    grade”. The

mark-to-market

exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt
    rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds
    generally range from zero to $50 million for the majority
    of our contracts. As of December 31, 2010, the credit
    ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade.

Because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge
    accounting treatment, changes in the fair values of derivatives
    can have a significant impact on our results of operations.
    Generally, changes in derivative fair values will not impact our
    liquidity or capital resources.

Settlements of derivative instruments, regardless of whether
    they qualify for hedge accounting, do have an impact on our
    liquidity and results of operations. Generally, if actual market
    prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments,
    our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower
    relative to the results that would have occurred absent these
    instruments. The opposite is also true. Additional information
    regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on
    our derivative financial instruments, net earnings and cash flow
    from operations is included in “Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

Goodwill

Policy
    Description

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the
    allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible
    net assets acquired with any excess recorded as goodwill.
    Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. The
    impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other
    assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair
    value of each reporting unit is estimated and compared to the
    net book value of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair
    value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value,
    including goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the
    implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The annual impairment test, which we conduct as of October 31
    each year, requires us to estimate the fair values of our own
    assets and liabilities. Because quoted market prices are not
    available for our reporting



units, we must estimate the fair values to conduct the goodwill
    impairment test. The most significant judgments involved in
    estimating the fair values of our reporting units relate to the
    valuation of our property and equipment. We develop estimated
    fair values of our property and equipment by performing various
    quantitative analyses based upon information related to
    comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.

In our comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
    market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
    independent exploration and production companies with financial
    and operating characteristics that are comparable to our
    respective reporting units. Such characteristics are market
    capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
    characterization of the reserves. In our comparable transactions
    analysis, we review certain acquisition multiples for selected
    independent exploration and production company transactions and
    oil and gas asset packages announced recently. In our premiums
    paid analysis, we use a sample of selected independent
    exploration and production company transactions in addition to
    selected transactions of all publicly traded companies announced
    recently, to review the premiums paid to the price of the target
    one day and one month prior to the announcement of the
    transaction. We use this information to determine the mean and
    median premiums paid.

We then use the comparable company multiples, comparable
    transaction multiples, transaction premiums and other data to
    develop valuation estimates of our property and equipment. We
    also use market and other data to develop valuation estimates of
    the other assets and liabilities included in our reporting
    units. At October 31, 2010, the date of our last impairment
    test, the fair values of our United States and Canadian
    reporting units substantially exceeded their related carrying
    values.

A lower goodwill value decreases the likelihood of an impairment
    charge. However, unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price
    forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment
    charge. A goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on
    liquidity or capital resources. However, it would adversely
    affect our results of operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
    in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
    provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
    changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
    average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.

Income
    Taxes

Policy
    Description

We are required to estimate federal, state, provincial and
    foreign income taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate.
    This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure
    together with assessing future tax consequences resulting in
    deferred income taxes. We account for deferred income taxes
    using the asset and liability method. Under this method,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also
    recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the
    expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss
    carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
    expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
    temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be
    recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
    the period that includes the enactment date.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of
    complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and
    foreign tax jurisdictions. We recognize current tax expense
    based on estimated taxable income for the current period applied
    at the applicable statutory tax rates. We routinely assess
    potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and
    establish accruals for such amounts. We have recognized deferred
    tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating
    losses and other tax carryforwards. We routinely assess our
    deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation
    allowance if we deem it is more



likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. The accruals for deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of
    judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely
    based on changes in facts and circumstances. Material changes in
    these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of
    ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of
    pending tax matters.

Forward-Looking
    Estimates

We are providing our 2011 forward-looking estimates in this
    section. These estimates were based on our examination of
    historical operating trends, the information used to prepare our
    December 31, 2010, reserve reports and other data in our
    possession or available from third parties. The forward-looking
    estimates in this report were prepared assuming demand,
    curtailment, producibility and general market conditions for our
    oil, gas and NGLs during 2011 will be similar to 2010, unless
    otherwise noted. We make reference to the “Disclosure
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of
    this report. Amounts related to our Canadian operations have
    been converted to U.S. dollars using an estimated average
    2011 exchange rate of $0.95 dollar to $1.00 Canadian dollar.

During 2011, our operations are substantially comprised of our
    ongoing North America Onshore operations. We also have
    International operations in Brazil and Angola that we are
    divesting. We have entered into agreements to sell our assets in
    Brazil for $3.2 billion and our assets in Angola for
    $70 million, plus contingent consideration. As a result of
    these divestitures, all revenues, expenses and capital related
    to our International operations are reported as discontinued
    operations in our financial statements. Additionally, all
    forward-looking estimates in this document exclude amounts
    related to our International operations, unless otherwise noted.

Commodity
    Price Risk Management

From time to time, we enter into NYMEX related financial
    commodity collar and price swap contracts. Such contracts are
    used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due
    to oil, gas and NGL price volatility. Although these financial
    contracts do not relate to specific production from our
    operating areas, they will affect our overall revenues, earnings
    and cash flow in 2011.

As of February 10, 2011, our financial commodity contracts
    pertaining to 2011 consisted of oil price collars, oil call
    options, gas price swaps, gas basis swaps and NGL basis swaps.
    The key terms of these contracts are presented in the following
    tables.

To the extent that monthly NYMEX prices in 2011 are outside of
    the ranges established by the collars or differ from those
    established by the swaps, we and the counterparties to the
    contracts will cash-settle the difference. Such settlements will
    either increase or decrease our revenues for the period. Also,
    we will

mark-to-market

the contracts based on their fair values throughout 2011.
    Changes in the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded
    as increases or decreases to our revenues. The expected ranges
    of our realized prices as a percentage of NYMEX prices, which
    are presented earlier in this report, do not include any
    estimates of the impact on our prices from monthly settlements
    or changes in the fair values of our price collars and swaps.



Marketing
    and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived
    primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline
    systems. These revenues and expenses vary in response to several
    factors. The factors include, but are not limited to, changes in
    production and NGL content from wells connected to the pipelines
    and related processing plants, changes in the absolute and
    relative prices of gas and NGLs, provisions of contractual
    agreements and the amount of repair and maintenance activity
    required to maintain anticipated processing levels and pipeline
    throughput volumes.

These factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
    future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
    these uncertainties, we estimate that our 2011 marketing and
    midstream operating profit will be between $485 million and
    $535 million. We estimate that marketing and midstream
    revenues will be between $1.485 billion and
    $1.760 billion, and marketing and midstream expenses will
    be between $1.000 billion and $1.225 billion.

Production
    and Operating Expenses

These expenses, which include transportation costs, vary in
    response to several factors. Among the most significant of these
    factors are additions to or deletions from the property base,
    changes in the general price level of services and materials
    that are used in the operation of the properties, as well as the
    amount of repair and workover activity required. Additionally,
    lease operating expenses associated with oil production,
    particularly heavy oil production, are generally higher than
    operating expenses associated with gas and NGL production. Oil,
    gas and NGL prices also have an effect on lease operating
    expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover
    projects.

Given these uncertainties, we expect that our 2011 lease
    operating expenses will be between $1.78 billion and
    $1.88 billion.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Our taxes other than income taxes primarily consist of
    production taxes and ad valorem taxes that relate to our
    U.S. Onshore properties and are assessed by various
    government agencies. Production taxes are based on a percentage
    of production revenues that varies by property and government
    jurisdiction. Ad valorem taxes generally are based on property
    values as determined by the government agency assessing the tax.
    Over time, a certain property’s assessed value will
    increase or decrease due to changes in commodity sales prices,
    production volumes and proved reserves. Therefore, ad valorem
    taxes will generally move in the same direction as our oil, gas
    and NGL sales but in a less predictable manner compared to
    production taxes. Additionally, both production and ad valorem
    taxes will increase or decrease due to changes in the rates
    assessed by the government agencies.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that our taxes other than
    income taxes for 2011 will be between 5.20% and 6.20% of total
    oil, gas and NGL sales.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”)

Our 2011 oil and gas property DD&A rate will depend on
    various factors. Most notable among such factors are the amount
    of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or
    acquisition efforts in 2011 compared to the costs incurred for
    such efforts, revisions to our year-end 2010 reserve estimates
    that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made during
    2011, as well as potential carrying value reductions that result
    from full cost ceiling tests.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that our oil and gas
    property related DD&A rate will be between $7.40 per Boe
    and $8.00 per Boe. Based on these DD&A rates and the
    production estimates set forth earlier, oil and gas property
    related DD&A expense for 2010 is expected to be between
    $1.76 billion and $1.90 billion.



Additionally, we expect that our depreciation and amortization
    expense related to non-oil and gas fixed assets will total
    between $265 million and $295 million in 2011.

Accretion
    of Asset Retirement Obligation

Accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2011 is expected to
    be between $85 million and $95 million.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our G&A includes employee compensation and benefits costs
    and the costs of many different goods and services used in
    support of our business. G&A varies with the level of our
    operating activities and the related staffing and professional
    services requirements. In addition, employee compensation and
    benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect
    the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to
    employees. Also, goods and services are subject to general price
    level increases or decreases. Therefore, significant variances
    in any of these factors from current expectations could cause
    actual G&A to vary materially from the estimate.

Given these limitations, we estimate our G&A for 2011 will
    be between $590 million and $630 million. This
    estimate includes approximately $110 million of non-cash,
    share-based compensation, net of related capitalization in
    accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and
    gas properties.

Interest
    Expense

Future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant
    effect on our interest expense. We can only marginally influence
    the prices we will receive in 2011 from sales of oil, gas and
    NGLs and the resulting cash flow. This increases the margin of
    error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances
    and related interest expense. Other factors that affect
    outstanding debt balances and related interest expense, such as
    the amount and timing of capital expenditures, are generally
    within our control.

As of December 31, 2010, we had total debt of
    $5.6 billion, which is exclusively fixed-rate debt at an
    overall weighted average rate of 7.1%. Our debt includes
    $1.75 billion that is scheduled to mature on
    September 30, 2011. We also have access to the commercial
    paper market and our credit lines. Any commercial paper or
    credit line borrowings would bear interest at variable rates.

Based on the factors above, we expect our 2011 interest expense
    to be between $300 million and $340 million. The
    estimated interest expense is exclusive of the anticipated
    effects of the interest rate swap contracts presented in the
    “Interest Rate Risk Management” section below.

The 2011 interest expense estimate above is comprised of three
    primary components — interest related to outstanding
    debt, fees and issuance costs and capitalized interest. We
    expect interest expense in 2011 related to our outstanding debt,
    including net accretion of related discounts, to be between
    $380 million and $420 million. We expect interest
    expense in 2011 related to facility and agency fees,
    amortization of debt issuance costs and other miscellaneous
    items not related to outstanding debt balances to be between
    $5 million and $15 million. During 2011, we also
    expect to capitalize between $85 million and
    $95 million of interest, of which $45 to $55 million
    relates to our continuing oil and gas activities and the
    remainder relates to certain corporate construction projects and
    our discontinued operations.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

From time to time, we enter into interest rate swaps. Such
    contracts are used to manage our exposure to interest rate
    volatility.

As of December 31, 2010, our interest rate swaps pertaining
    to 2011 consisted of instruments with a total notional amount of
    $2.10 billion. These consist of instruments with a notional
    amount of $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate
    and pay a variable rate. The remaining instruments consist of
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, we will net settle these contracts in September 2011, or
    sooner should we elect. The net settlement amount will be based
    upon us paying a weighted-average fixed rate



of 3.92% and receiving a floating rate that is based upon the
    three-month LIBOR. The difference between the fixed and floating
    rate will be applied to the notional amount for the

30-year

period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041.
    The key terms of these contracts are presented in the following
    tables.

Income
    Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2011 will vary materially
    depending on the actual amount of financial pre-tax earnings.
    The tax rate for 2011 will be significantly affected by the
    proportional share of consolidated pre-tax earnings generated by
    our United States and Canadian operations due to the different
    tax rates of each country. Also, certain tax deductions and
    credits will have a fixed impact on 2011 income tax expense
    regardless of the level of pre-tax earnings that are produced.
    Additionally, significant changes in estimated capital
    expenditures, production levels of oil, gas and NGLs, the prices
    of such products, marketing and midstream revenues, or any of
    the various expense items could materially alter the effect of
    these tax deductions and credits on 2011 financial income tax
    rates.

Given the uncertainty of pre-tax earnings, we expect that our
    total financial income tax rate in 2011 will be between 20% and
    40%. The current income tax rate is expected to be between 0%
    and 10%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to be between
    20% and 30%.

Capital
    Resources, Uses and Liquidity

North
    America Onshore Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of
    future oil, gas and NGL prices as well as the expected costs of
    the capital additions. Should actual prices received differ
    materially from our price expectations for our future
    production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred and,
    consequently, may increase or decrease total 2011 capital
    expenditures. In addition, if the actual material or labor costs
    of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated
    amounts, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from
    our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed above, we estimate that our 2011
    oil and gas development and exploration capital expenditures
    will be between $4.500 billion and $4.900 billion. We
    estimate that our development capital will be between
    $3.875 billion and $4.175 billion. Development capital
    includes activity related to reserves classified as proved and
    drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for
    which there is not a certainty of continued production from a
    known productive formation. Development capital also includes
    estimates for plugging and abandonment charges. We estimate that
    our exploration capital will be between $625 million and
    $725 million. Exploration capital includes exploratory
    drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested
    fault blocks or new reservoirs. Exploration capital also
    includes purchases of proved and unproved leasehold acreage. In
    addition to the development and exploration expenditures, we
    expect to



capitalize between $330 million and $350 million of
    G&A expenses and between $45 million and
    $55 million of interest related to our oil and gas
    activities.

In addition, we expect to spend between $225 million and
    $300 million on our midstream assets, which primarily
    include our oil pipelines, gas processing plants, and gas
    gathering and pipeline systems. We also expect total capital for
    corporate activities will be between $300 million and
    $395 million, including approximately $30 million of
    capitalized interest related to certain construction projects.

Other
    Cash Uses

In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion
    share repurchase program. This program expires on
    December 31, 2011. Through February 10, 2011, we had
    repurchased 23.5 million common shares for
    $1.6 billion, or $69.60 per share.

Our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common
    stock dividend to continue. With the current $0.16 per share
    quarterly dividend rate and expected share repurchases, 2011
    dividends are expected to approximate $264 million.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Our estimated 2011 cash uses, including our capital activities,
    are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of our
    existing cash balances and operating cash flow, supplemented
    with commercial paper borrowings. At the beginning of 2011, we
    held $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. The
    amount of operating cash flow to be generated during 2011 is
    uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as
    previously cited. However, if our operating cash flow were
    significantly less than our estimates, we would access the
    commercial paper market. Also, we have credit lines that we
    could access if deemed necessary. As of February 10, 2011,
    we had $2.0 billion of available credit under our credit
    lines.

Another major source of liquidity in 2011 will be the proceeds
    from the divestiture of our assets in Brazil and, to a lesser
    extent, the divestiture of our assets in Angola.

These sources of liquidity will allow us to continue
    repurchasing common shares and investing in the opportunities
    that exist across our North America Onshore portfolio of
    properties. We expect our combined capital resources to be
    adequate to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other
    cash uses for 2011.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market
    risk” refers to our risk of loss arising from adverse
    changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. The following disclosures are not meant
    to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
    instruments were entered into for purposes other than
    speculative trading.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
    our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
    driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
    market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian gas and
    NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has been
    volatile and unpredictable for several years. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Consequently, we
    periodically enter into financial hedging activities with
    respect to a portion of our oil, gas and NGL production through
    various financial transactions that hedge the future prices
    received. These transactions include financial price swaps,
    basis swaps and costless price collars. Additionally, to
    facilitate a portion of our price swaps, we have sold gas



call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012.
    The key terms of our derivatives in place as of
    December 31, 2010 are presented in the following tables.

The fair values of our commodity derivatives presented in the
    tables above are largely determined by estimates of the forward
    curves of the relevant price indices. At December 31, 2010,
    a 10% increase in the forward curves associated with our gas
    derivative instruments would have decreased the fair value of
    such instruments by approximately $154 million. A 10%
    increase in the forward curves associated with our oil
    derivative instruments would have decreased the fair value of
    these instruments by approximately $142 million.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2010, we had debt outstanding of
    $5.6 billion with fixed rates averaging 7.1%.

As of December 31, 2010, our interest rate swaps consisted
    of instruments with a total notional amount of
    $2.1 billion. These consist of instruments with a notional
    amount of $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate
    and pay a variable rate. The remaining instruments consist of
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, we will net settle these contracts in September 2011, or
    sooner should we



elect. The net settlement amount will be based upon us paying a
    weighted-average fixed rate of 3.92% and receiving a floating
    rate that is based upon the three-month LIBOR. The difference
    between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the
    notional amount for the

30-year

period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041.

The fair values of our interest rate instruments are largely
    determined by estimates of the forward curves of the Federal
    Funds rate and LIBOR. At December 31, 2010, a 10% increase
    in these forward curves would have increased the fair value of
    our interest rate swaps by approximately $68 million.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
    subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of
    such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional
    currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable
    exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues,
    expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange
    rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in
    the

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate would not materially impact our December 31,
    2010 balance sheet.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss),
    stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. We also
    have audited Devon Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Devon Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for these
    consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    contained in “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures”
    of Devon Energy Corporation’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements
    included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
    subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
    conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The more significant of such policies
    are discussed below.

Nature
    of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in the acquisition, exploration,
    development and production of oil and gas properties. Such
    activities are concentrated in the following North American
    onshore geographic areas:

•

the Mid-Continent area of the central and southern United
    States, principally in north and east Texas, as well as Oklahoma;

•

the Permian Basin within Texas and New Mexico;

•

the Rocky Mountains area of the United States stretching from
    the Canadian border into northern New Mexico;

•

the onshore areas of the Gulf Coast, principally in south Texas
    and south Louisiana; and

•

the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan in
    Canada.

In November 2009, Devon announced plans to strategically
    reposition itself as a North American onshore exploration and
    development company. During 2010, Devon divested its properties
    in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan, China and other International
    regions. Additionally, Devon has entered into agreements to sell
    its remaining offshore assets in Brazil and Angola. These
    activities are more fully described in Note 5.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations that perform
    various activities to support the oil and gas operations of
    Devon and unrelated third parties. Such activities include
    marketing gas, crude oil and NGLs, as well as constructing and
    operating pipelines, storage and treating facilities and natural
    gas processing plants.

The accounts of Devon’s controlled subsidiaries are
    included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include the following:

•

estimates of proved reserves and related estimates of the
    present value of future net revenues;

•

the carrying value of oil and gas properties;

•

estimates of the fair value of reporting units and related
    assessment of goodwill for impairment;

•

derivative financial instruments;

•

income taxes;

•

asset retirement obligations;



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

obligations related to employee pension and postretirement
    benefits; and

•

legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Devon is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing
    business operations, including risks related to commodity
    prices, interest rates and Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange
    rates. As discussed more fully below, Devon uses derivative
    instruments primarily to manage commodity price risk and
    interest rate risk. Devon does not hold or issue derivative
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Besides
    these derivative instruments, Devon also had an embedded option
    derivative related to the fair value of its debentures
    exchangeable into shares of Chevron common stock. Devon ceased
    to have this option when the exchangeable debentures matured on
    August 15, 2008.

Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments
    with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production
    that hedge the future prices received. These instruments are
    used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due
    to commodity price volatility. Devon’s derivative financial
    instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless
    price collars and call options. Under the terms of the price
    swaps, Devon receives a fixed price for its production and pays
    a variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the
    basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two
    regional gas index prices and pays a variable differential on
    the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The
    price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged
    production. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside
    of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various
    collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the
    counterparty to the collars. Under the terms of a call option,
    Devon received a cash premium for selling call options. The call
    options then give the counterparty the right to place us into a
    price swap at a predetermined fixed price.

Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its
    exposure to interest rate volatility. Devon’s interest rate
    swaps include contracts in which Devon receives a fixed rate and
    pays a variable rate on a total notional amount. Devon also has
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, Devon will net settle these contracts in September 2011
    or sooner should Devon elect. The net settlement amount will be
    based upon Devon paying a fixed rate and receiving a floating
    rate that is based upon the three-month LIBOR. The difference
    between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the
    notional amount for the

30-year

period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    For derivative financial instruments held during the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2010, Devon chose not to meet the
    necessary criteria to qualify its derivative financial
    instruments for hedge accounting treatment. Cash settlements
    with counterparties to Devon’s derivative financial
    instruments are also recorded in the statement of operations.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
    changes in commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes
    itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the
    failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
    derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging
    instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom
    Devon believes are minimal credit risks. It is Devon’s
    policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment
    grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent
    and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devon’s
    derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be
    posted if either its or the counterparty’s credit rating
    falls below investment grade. The

mark-to-market

exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted,
    decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment
    grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to
    $50 million for the majority of



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our contracts. As of December 31, 2010, the credit ratings
    of all Devon’s counterparties were investment grade.

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative financial
    instrument that results from a change in commodity prices,
    interest rates or other relevant underlyings. The market risks
    associated with commodity price and interest rate contracts are
    managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the
    types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. The oil
    and gas reference prices upon which the commodity instruments
    are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree
    of historical correlation with actual prices received by Devon.

See Note 3 for the amounts included in Devon’s
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
    statements of operations associated with its derivative
    financial instruments.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Certain of Devon’s assets and liabilities are measured at
    fair value at each reporting date. Fair value represents the
    price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to
    transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants. This price is commonly referred to as the
    “exit price”.

Fair value measurements are classified according to a hierarchy
    that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques.
    This hierarchy consists of three broad levels. Level 1
    inputs on the hierarchy consist of unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the
    highest priority. Level 2 measurements are based on inputs
    other than quoted prices that are generally observable for the
    asset or liability. Common examples of Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and
    liabilities in markets not considered to be active. Level 3
    measurements have the lowest priority and are based upon inputs
    that are not observable from objective sources. The most common
    Level 3 fair value measurement is an internally developed
    cash flow model. Devon uses appropriate valuation techniques
    based on the available inputs to measure the fair values of its
    assets and liabilities. When available, Devon measures fair
    value using Level 1 inputs because they generally provide
    the most reliable evidence of fair value.

See Note 11 for fair value measurements included in
    Devon’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Discontinued
    Operations

As a result of the November 2009 plan to divest Devon’s
    offshore assets, all amounts related to Devon’s
    International operations are classified as discontinued
    operations. The Gulf of Mexico properties that were divested in
    2010 do not qualify as discontinued operations under accounting
    rules. As such, amounts in these notes and the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements that pertain to continuing
    operations include amounts related to Devon’s offshore Gulf
    of Mexico operations. See Note 5 for additional details of
    the offshore divestiture program.

The captions assets held for sale and liabilities associated
    with assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets present the assets and liabilities associated
    with Devon’s discontinued operations. Devon measures its
    assets held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or
    estimated fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, Devon
    does not recognize depreciation, depletion and amortization on
    its long-lived assets held for sale.

Property
    and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
    gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
    acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
    properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
    and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
    incurred that are



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

directly identified with acquisition, exploration and
    development activities undertaken by Devon for its own account,
    and that are not related to production, general corporate
    overhead or similar activities, are also capitalized. Interest
    costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas
    properties under current evaluation and major development
    projects of oil and gas properties are also capitalized. All
    costs related to production activities, including workover costs
    incurred solely to maintain or increase levels of production
    from an existing completion interval, are charged to expense as
    incurred.

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
    oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
    limitation is the estimated after-tax future net revenues,
    discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil, gas and NGL
    reserves plus the cost of properties not subject to
    amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude future cash
    outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations
    included in the net book value of oil and gas properties. Such
    limitations are imposed separately on a

country-by-country

basis and are tested quarterly.

Future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent
    the average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the

12-month

period prior to the end of the period. Prior to
    December 31, 2009, prices and costs used to calculate
    future net revenues were those as of the end of the appropriate
    quarterly period. Prices are held constant indefinitely and are
    not changed except where different prices are fixed and
    determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of
    those contracts, including derivative contracts in place that
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment. None of Devon’s
    derivative contracts held during the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2010 qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes,
    over the ceiling is written off as an expense. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher commodity prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Capitalized costs are depleted by an equivalent

unit-of-production

method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic
    feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is calculated using
    the capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement
    costs, plus the estimated future expenditures (based on current
    costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves, net of
    estimated salvage values.

Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the
    depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not
    proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Devon
    assesses its unproved properties for impairment quarterly.
    Significant unproved properties are assessed individually. Costs
    of insignificant unproved properties are transferred into the
    depletion calculation over holding periods ranging from three to
    five years.

No gain or loss is recognized upon disposal of oil and gas
    properties unless such disposal significantly alters the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in a
    particular country.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a

unit-of-production

basis. Depreciation and amortization of other property and
    equipment, including corporate and other midstream assets and
    leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to
    39 years. Interest costs incurred and attributable to major
    midstream and corporate construction projects are also
    capitalized.

Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations
    associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing
    well sites, offshore production platforms, and midstream
    pipelines and processing plants when there is a legal obligation
    associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset
    retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair
    value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an
    increase to the associated property and equipment on the
    consolidated balance sheet. If the fair value of a recorded
    asset retirement obligation changes, a revision is recorded to
    both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement
    cost. The asset retirement cost is

    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to
    that used for the associated property and equipment.

Investments

Devon reports its investments and other marketable securities at
    fair value, except for debt securities in which management has
    the ability and intent to hold until maturity.

Devon’s primary investments consist of auction rate
    securities that totaled $94 million and $115 million
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These
    securities are rated AAA — the highest
    rating — by one or more rating agencies and are
    collateralized by student loans that are substantially
    guaranteed by the United States government. Although
    Devon’s auction rate securities generally have contractual
    maturities of more than 20 years, the underlying interest
    rates on such securities are scheduled to reset every seven to
    28 days. Therefore, these auction rate securities were
    generally priced and subsequently traded as short-term
    investments because of the interest rate reset feature.

Since February 8, 2008, Devon has experienced difficulty
    selling its securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism, which provided liquidity to these securities. An
    auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
    securities could not do so. The securities for which auctions
    have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned
    every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.

From February 2008, when auctions began failing, to
    December 31, 2010, issuers have redeemed $58 million
    of Devon’s auction rate securities holdings at par.
    However, based on continued auction failures and the current
    market for Devon’s auction rate securities, Devon has
    classified its auction rate securities as long-term investments
    as of December 31, 2010. These securities are included in
    other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet. Devon has the ability to hold the securities until
    maturity. At this time, Devon does not believe the values of its
    long-term securities are impaired.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
    quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
    reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
    estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
    comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.

Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
    fourth quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008. Based on these
    assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
    assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    The increase in Devon’s continuing operations goodwill from
    2009 to 2010 is due to changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Devon removed all its
    International goodwill in conjunction with the Azerbaijan
    divestiture that closed in 2010. Such goodwill was presented in
    long-term assets held for sale in the accompanying
    December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet.

Foreign
    Currency Translation Adjustments

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devon’s
    consolidated operations except its Canadian subsidiaries, which
    use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore,
    the assets and liabilities of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated into U.S. dollars based on the current
    exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Canadian
    income and expenses are translated at average rates for the
    periods presented. Translation adjustments have no effect on net
    income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings in stockholders’ equity. The following table

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
    assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for environmental
    remediation or restoration claims are recorded when it is
    probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Expenditures related to such
    environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance
    with Devon’s accounting policy for property and equipment.
    Reference is made to Note 10 for a discussion of amounts
    recorded for these liabilities.

Revenue
    Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL sales are recognized when production is sold to
    a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the
    revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is transferred
    when production has been delivered to a pipeline, railcar or
    truck or a tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating
    to future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by governmental
    authorities on oil, gas and NGL sales are presented separately
    from such revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements
    of operations.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining
    reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced
    owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The
    liability is priced based on current market prices. No
    receivables are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken
    less than its share of production unless all revenue recognition
    criteria are met. If an imbalance exists at the time the
    wells’ reserves are depleted, settlements are made among
    the joint interest owners under a variety of arrangements.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
    products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
    fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the
    revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to oil,
    gas and NGL purchases, transportation and processing contracts
    are reported on a gross basis when Devon takes title to the
    products and has risks and rewards of ownership.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, no purchaser accounted for more than
    10% of Devon’s revenues from continuing operations.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
    reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
    properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
    pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Share
    Based Compensation

Devon grants stock options, restricted stock awards and other
    types of share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors
    and selected employees. All such awards are measured at fair
    value on the date of grant and are recognized as a component of
    general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
    statements of operations over the applicable requisite service
    periods. As a result of Devon’s strategic repositioning
    announced in 2009, certain share based awards were accelerated
    and recognized as a component of restructuring expense in the
    accompanying 2010 and 2009 statements of operations.

Generally, Devon uses new shares to grant share-based awards and
    to issue shares upon stock option exercises. Shares repurchased
    under approved programs are available to be issued as part of
    Devon’s share based awards. However, Devon has historically
    cancelled these shares upon repurchase.

Income
    Taxes

Devon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal
    and various state jurisdictions in the United States and by
    other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for
    deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions using the
    asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
    consequences attributable to differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized
    for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected
    utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and
    other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
    settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
    change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
    includes the enactment date.

Devon does not recognize United States deferred income taxes on
    the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that are
    deemed to be permanently reinvested. When such earnings are no
    longer deemed permanently reinvested, Devon recognizes the
    appropriate deferred income tax liabilities.

Devon recognizes the financial statement effects of tax
    positions when it is more likely than not, based on the
    technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon
    examination by a taxing authority. Recognized tax positions are
    initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax
    benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits related to such tax positions are
    included in other long-term liabilities unless the tax position
    is expected to be settled within the upcoming year, in which
    case the liabilities are included in other current liabilities.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    included in current income tax

expense. Additional information regarding Devon’s
    unrecognized tax benefits, including changes in such amounts
    during 2010 and 2009, is provided in Note 17.

Net
    Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

Devon’s basic earnings per share amounts have been computed
    based on the average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding for the period. Basic earnings per share includes
    the effect of participating securities, which primarily consist
    of Devon’s outstanding restricted stock awards. Diluted
    earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method
    to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
    Devon’s dilutive outstanding stock options were exercised.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Devon considers all highly liquid investments with original
    contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents.

Offshore
    Divestitures

In November 2009, Devon announced plans to reposition itself
    strategically as a North America onshore exploration and
    production company. As part of this strategic repositioning,
    Devon is bringing forward the value of its offshore assets by
    divesting them.

Closed
    Transactions

The following table presents Devon’s offshore divestiture
    transactions that closed in 2010. Gross proceeds represent
    contract prices based upon a January 1, 2010 effective date
    for the Gulf of Mexico and Azerbaijan divestitures, a
    May 1, 2010 effective date for the China — Panyu
    divestiture and a September 1, 2010 effective date for the
    China-Exploration divestiture. After-tax proceeds represent
    gross proceeds adjusted for customary purchase price
    adjustments, selling costs and income taxes. The purchase price
    adjustments consist primarily of net cash flow subsequent to the
    effective date of the divestitures. Proved reserves in the
    following table are based upon estimated proved reserves as of
    the divestiture dates.

Proceeds from these divestitures are being used to retire debt
    and repurchase Devon common shares. Additionally, Devon is using
    divestiture proceeds to fund North America Onshore
    exploration and development opportunities, including a
    joint-venture investment in the Pike oil sands discussed below.

Under full cost accounting rules, sales or other dispositions of
    oil and gas properties are generally accounted for as
    adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of gain or
    loss. However, if not recognizing a gain or loss on the
    disposition would otherwise significantly alter the relationship
    between a cost center’s capitalized costs and proved
    reserves, then a gain or loss must be recognized.

The Gulf of Mexico divestitures presented above did not
    significantly alter such relationship for Devon’s United
    States cost center. Therefore, Devon did not recognize a gain in
    connection with the Gulf of Mexico divestitures. The Azerbaijan
    divestiture included all of Devon’s properties in its
    Azerbaijan cost center. As a result, Devon recognized a
    $1,543 million ($1,524 million after-tax) gain during
    2010 in connection with the Azerbaijan divestiture. Panyu was
    Devon’s only producing property in its China cost center.
    As a result, Devon recognized a $308 million
    ($235 million after-tax) gain in connection with the Panyu
    divestiture in 2010. These gains are included in “earnings
    from discontinued operations” in the accompanying 2010
    consolidated statement of operations.

Pending
    Transactions

Devon has entered into agreements to sell its remaining offshore
    assets in Brazil and Angola and is waiting for the respective
    governments to approve the divestitures. The Brazil divestiture
    is valued at $3.2 billion, and Devon expects to record a
    gain upon the close of this transaction. For the Angola
    divestiture, Devon will receive $70 million at closing, and
    has the potential to receive future consideration that is
    contingent upon the buyer achieving certain milestones.

Deepwater
    Drilling Rigs

As part of its offshore operations, Devon was leasing three
    deepwater drilling rigs. The Seadrill West Sirius and Ocean
    Endeavor deepwater drilling rigs were used in Devon’s Gulf
    of Mexico operations. The Transocean Deepwater Discovery is
    currently being used in Devon’s operations in Brazil.

In conjunction with the deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestiture
    that closed in the second quarter of 2010, the buyer assumed
    Devon’s lease and remaining commitments for the Seadrill
    West Sirius rig. Subsequent to closing all its Gulf of Mexico
    divestitures, Devon agreed to pay $31 million to the owner
    of the Ocean Endeavor rig to terminate the lease. The
    $31 million lease termination cost is included in oil and
    gas property and equipment in the accompanying December 31,
    2010, consolidated balance sheet. The buyer of Devon’s
    assets in Brazil will assume Devon’s lease and remaining
    commitments for the Transocean Deepwater Discovery rig when the
    divestiture transaction closes.

Oil Sands
    Joint Venture

In conjunction with certain offshore divestitures in the second
    quarter of 2010, Devon formed a heavy oil joint venture to
    operate and develop the Pike oil sands leases in Alberta,
    Canada. As a result, Devon acquired a 50 percent interest
    in the Pike oil sands leases for $500 million. Devon will
    also fund $155 million of Canadian dollar capital costs on
    behalf of its joint-venture partner in the form of a
    non-interest bearing promissory note. The majority of the
    capital costs are expected to be paid during 2011 and 2012. See
    Note 6 for more information regarding the promissory note.

Reductions
    of Carrying Value

In the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008,
    Devon reduced the carrying values of its oil and gas properties
    due to full cost ceiling limitations. These reductions are
    discussed in Note 15.

    outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity
    dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the
    election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options
    for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally
    less than the prime rate. However, Devon may elect to borrow at
    the prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides
    for an annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable
    quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2010, there were
    no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial
    covenant. This covenant requires Devon’s ratio of total
    funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65%. The
    credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and
    total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective
    amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Also,
    total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial
    writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill
    impairments. As of December 31, 2010, Devon was in
    compliance with this covenant. Devon’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2010, as calculated pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, was 15.1%.

The following schedule summarizes the capacity of Devon’s
    Senior Credit Facility by maturity date, as well as its
    available capacity as of December 31, 2010 (in millions).

Commercial
    Paper

Devon also has access to approximately $2,200 million of
    short-term credit under its commercial paper program. Any
    borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce available
    capacity under the Senior Credit Facility on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index
    such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate
    as found on the commercial paper market.

During the first half of 2010, Devon repaid $1,432 million
    of commercial paper borrowings primarily with proceeds received
    from its Gulf of Mexico property divestitures. At
    December 31, 2010, Devon had no outstanding commercial
    paper borrowings. The average borrowing rate for Devon’s
    $1,432 million of commercial paper borrowings at
    December 31, 2009 was 0.29%.

$350
    Million 7.25% Senior Notes Due October 1,

On June 25, 2010, Devon redeemed $350 million of
    7.25% senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity of
    October 1, 2011, primarily with proceeds received from its
    Gulf of Mexico divestitures. The notes were redeemed for
    $384 million, which represented 100 percent of the
    principal amount, a make-whole premium of $28 million and
    $6 million of accrued and unpaid interest. On the date of
    redemption, these notes also had an unamortized premium of
    $9 million. The $28 million make-whole premium and
    $9 million amortization of the remaining premium are
    included in interest expense in the accompanying 2010
    consolidated statements of operations.

Non-Interest
    Bearing Promissory Note Due June 29, 2014

On June 29, 2010, Devon issued a four-year
    $155 million Canadian dollar non-interest bearing
    promissory note in connection with the formation of the Pike oil
    sands joint venture described in Note 5. The present value
    of the note was $139 million on the issue date based upon
    an effective interest rate of 3.125%. At

Other
    Debentures and Notes

Following are descriptions of the various other debentures and
    notes outstanding at December 31, 2010, as listed in the
    table presented at the beginning of this note.

6.875% Notes
    due September 30, 2011 and 7.875% Debentures due
    September 30, 2031

On October 3, 2001, Devon, through Devon Financing
    Corporation, U.L.C. (“Devon Financing”), a
    wholly-owned finance subsidiary, sold these notes and
    debentures, which are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations
    of Devon Financing. Devon has fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis the
    obligations of Devon Financing under the debt securities. The
    proceeds from the issuance of these debt securities were used to
    fund a portion of the acquisition of Anderson Exploration.

5.625% Notes
    due January 15, 2014 and 6.30% Notes due
    January 15, 2019

On January 9, 2009, Devon sold these notes, which are
    unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon. The net
    proceeds from issuance of this debt were used primarily to repay
    Devon’s outstanding commercial paper as of
    December 31, 2008.

Ocean
    Debt

As a result of the April 25, 2003 merger with Ocean Energy,
    Inc., Devon assumed certain debt instruments that remain
    outstanding at December 31, 2010. The table below
    summarizes the debt assumed, the fair value of the debt at
    April 25, 2003, and the effective interest rate of the debt
    assumed after determining the fair values of the respective
    notes using April 25, 2003, market interest rates. The
    premiums resulting from fair values exceeding face values are
    being amortized using the effective interest method. All of the
    notes are general unsecured obligations of Devon.

During 2010 and 2009, Devon recognized revisions to its asset
    retirement obligations totaling $194 million and
    $33 million, respectively. The primary factors causing the
    2010 and 2009 increases were an overall increase in abandonment
    cost estimates and a decrease in the discount rate used to
    present value the obligations.

During 2010, Devon reduced its asset retirement obligations by
    $269 million primarily for those obligations that were
    assumed by purchasers of Devon’s Gulf of Mexico oil and gas
    properties.

Retirement
    Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
    and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
    Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
    U.S. and Canadian employees meeting certain age and service
    requirements. Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
    employees’ years of service and compensation and are funded
    from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
    employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
    by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
    are based on the employees’ years of service and
    compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
    established trusts to



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

fund these plans’ benefit obligations. The total value of
    these trusts was $36 million and $39 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included
    in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets. For the remaining Supplemental Plans for which
    trusts have not been established, benefits are funded from
    Devon’s available cash and cash equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
    (“Postretirement Plans”) that provide benefits for
    substantially all U.S. employees. The Postretirement Plans
    provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and
    are, depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
    non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
    Plans are estimated based on Devon’s future cost-sharing
    intentions. Devon’s funding policy for the Postretirement
    Plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with
    available cash and cash equivalents.

Benefit
    Obligations and Funded Status

The following table presents the status of Devon’s pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligation
    for pension plans represents the projected benefit obligation,
    while the benefit obligation for the postretirement benefit
    plans represents the accumulated benefit obligation. The
    accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected
    benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption
    about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit
    obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    was $1,010 million and $873 million, respectively.
    Devon’s benefit obligations and plan assets are measured
    each year as of December 31.

Discount rate

— Future pension and
    postretirement obligations are discounted at the end of each
    year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively
    settled, considering the timing of estimated future cash flows
    related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond
    yields, after allowing for call and default risk. High quality
    corporate bond yield indices are considered when selecting the
    discount rate.

Rate of compensation increase

— For measurement
    of the 2010 benefit obligation for the pension plans, the 6.94%
    compensation increase in the table above represents the assumed
    increase through 2011. The rate was assumed to decrease to 5% in
    the year 2012 and remain at that level thereafter.

Expected return on plan assets

— The expected
    rate of return on plan assets was determined by evaluating input
    from external consultants and economists as well as long-term
    inflation assumptions. Devon expects the long-term asset
    allocation to approximate the targeted allocation. Therefore,
    the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on
    the target allocation of investment types in such assets. See
    plan assets discussion below for more information on
    Devon’s target allocations.

Other assumptions

— For measurement of the 2010
    benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans,
    an 8.3% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered health care benefits was assumed for 2011. The rate was
    assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of 5% in the
    year 2029 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health
    care cost-trend rates affect the amounts reported for retiree
    health care costs. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
    health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on
    the December 31, 2010 other postretirement benefits
    obligation and the 2011 service and interest cost components of
    net periodic benefit cost.

Pension
    Plan Assets

Devon’s overall investment objective for its pension
    plans’ assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested
    capital and income to ensure benefit payments can be funded when
    required. To assist in achieving this objective, Devon has
    established certain investment strategies, including target
    allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments,
    designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The vast majority of Devon’s plan assets are invested in
    diversified asset types to generate long-term growth and income.
    The remaining plan assets, generally less than 5%, are invested
    in assets that can be used for near-term benefit payments.
    Derivatives or other speculative investments considered high
    risk are generally prohibited.

At the end of 2010 and 2009, Devon’s target allocations for
    plan assets were 47.5% for equity securities, 40% for
    fixed-income securities and 12.5% for other investment types.
    The fair values of Devon’s pension assets at

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair values of the assets in the tables above.

Equity securities

— Devon’s equity
    securities consist of investments in United States large and
    small capitalization companies and international large
    capitalization companies. These equity securities are actively
    traded securities that can be redeemed upon demand. The fair
    values of these Level 1 securities are based upon quoted
    market prices.

Devon’s equity securities also include commingled funds
    that invest in large capitalization companies. These equity
    securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively
    traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are
    based upon the net asset values provided by the investment
    managers.

Fixed-income securities

— Devon’s
    fixed-income securities consist of bonds issued by
    investment-grade companies from diverse industries, United
    States Treasury obligations and asset-backed securities.
    Devon’s fixed-income securities are actively traded
    securities that can be redeemed upon demand. The fair values of
    these Level 1 securities are based upon quoted market
    prices.

Other securities

— Devon’s other
    securities include commingled, short-term investment funds.
    These securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively
    traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are
    based upon the net asset values provided by investment managers.

Devon’s other securities also include a hedge fund of funds
    that invests both long and short using a variety of investment
    strategies. Management of the hedge fund has the ability to
    shift investments from value to growth strategies, from small to
    large capitalization stocks, and from a net long position to a
    net short position. Devon’s hedge fund is not actively
    traded and Devon is subject to redemption restrictions with
    regards to this investment. The fair value of this Level 3
    investment represents the fair value as determined by the hedge
    fund manager.

Included below is a summary of the changes in Devon’s
    Level 3 plan assets.

    percentage is determined annually by the Board of Directors.

Devon also has an enhanced defined contribution structure
    related to its 401(k) Plan. Participants who elected to
    participate in this enhanced defined contribution structure when
    it was established, as well as all employees hired after the
    enhanced defined contribution structure was established, receive
    a discretionary match of a percentage of their contributions to
    the 401(k) Plan. The participants also receive additional,
    nondiscretionary contributions by Devon calculated as a
    percentage of annual compensation. The percentage will vary
    based on the employees’ years of service.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
    employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee that is
    based upon the employee’s base compensation and
    classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
    amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
    has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
    plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
    employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
    percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
    additional Devon contributions.

Stockholders’
    Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of 1 billion
    shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and
    4.5 million shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per
    share. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series,
    and the terms and rights of such stock will be determined by the
    Board of Directors.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated 2.9 million
    shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock”). At December 31, 2010, there were no
    shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock issued or
    outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
    entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per share
    equal to the greater of $1.00 or 100 times the aggregate per
    share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends)
    declared on common stock since the immediately preceding
    quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first
    payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock are entitled to 100 votes per share on all matters
    submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The Corporation, at its
    option, may redeem shares of the Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock in whole at any time and in part
    from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 times the
    current per share market price of the Common Stock on the date
    of the mailing of the notice of redemption. The Series A
    Junior Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but
    junior to all other classes of Preferred Stock.

Stock
    Repurchases

During 2010, Devon’s Board of Directors announced a share
    repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to
    $3,500 million of its common shares. This program, which
    expires December 31, 2011, was created as a result of the
    success experienced from the offshore divestiture program
    described in Note 5.

During 2008, Devon’s Board of Directors approved an
    ongoing, annual stock repurchase program to minimize dilution
    resulting from restricted stock issued to, and options exercised
    by, employees. Also, Devon’s Board of Directors approved a
    program in 2007 to repurchase up to 50 million shares. This
    program was created as a potential use of the proceeds received
    from Devon’s West African property divestitures. Both of
    these plans expired on December 31, 2009.

The following table summarizes Devon’s repurchases under
    approved plans (amounts and shares in millions).

Preferred
    Stock Redemption

On June 20, 2008, Devon redeemed all 1.5 million
    outstanding shares of its 6.49% Series A cumulative
    preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock was redeemed for
    cash at a redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends up to the redemption date.

Dividends

Devon paid common stock dividends of $281 million (or $0.64
    per share) in 2010 and $284 million (or $0.64 per share) in
    both 2009 and 2008, respectively. Devon paid dividends of
    $5 million in 2008 to preferred stockholders.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
    course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
    outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
    accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
    matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters
    and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
    similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management
    to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s
    financial position or results of operations after consideration
    of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ
    materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental
    Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
    environmental remediation activities associated with past
    operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes. In
    response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss
    accruals primarily consist of estimated uninsured costs
    associated with remediation. Devon’s monetary exposure for
    environmental matters is not expected to be material.

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including
    Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of
    the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the
    producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from
    federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. Devon does not
    currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with
    respect to such royalty matters.

Other
    Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge,
    there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which
    Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Commitments

The following is a schedule by year of purchase obligations,
    future minimum payments for drilling and facility obligations,
    firm transportation agreements and leases that have initial or
    remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
    December 31, 2010. The schedule includes separate amounts
    for Devon’s continuing and discontinued operations.

Devon has certain purchase obligations related to its heavy oil
    projects in Canada to purchase condensate at market prices.
    Devon entered into these agreements because the condensate is an
    integral part of the heavy oil production process and any
    disruption in Devon’s ability to obtain condensate could
    negatively affect its ability to produce and transport heavy oil
    at these locations. Devon’s total obligation related to
    condensate purchases expires in 2021. The value of these
    purchase obligations presented in the table above is based on
    the contractual volumes and Devon’s internal estimate of
    future condensate market prices.

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under
    contractual agreements with third-party service providers to
    procure drilling rigs and other related services for
    developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities
    construction. Included in the discontinued operations
    obligations are amounts related to a long-term contract for a
    deepwater drilling rig being used in Brazil. Devon’s lease
    and remaining commitments for this rig will be assumed by the
    buyer of its assets in Brazil when the associated divestiture
    transaction closes.

Devon has certain firm transportation agreements that represent
    “ship or pay” arrangements whereby Devon has committed
    to ship certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed
    transportation fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to
    aid the movement of its production to market. Devon expects to
    have sufficient production to utilize these transportation
    services.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
    lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
    administrative expenses under operating leases, net of

sub-lease

income, was $57 million, $56 million and
    $44 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Devon has a floating, production, storage and offloading
    facility (“FPSO”) that is being used in the Polvo
    project offshore Brazil and is being leased under operating
    lease arrangements. This lease will be assumed by the buyer when
    the associated divestiture transaction closes. However, the
    amounts in the table above reflect Devon’s full commitments
    under the lease. Total rental expense included in lease
    operating expenses for Devon’s FPSO’s was
    $25 million, $36 million and $25 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair values of the assets and liabilities in the tables above.

Level 1
    Fair Value Measurements

Debt

— The fair value of Devon’s
    variable-rate commercial paper borrowings is the carrying value.

Short-term investments

— Devon’s
    short-term investments consist entirely of United States
    Treasury bills with maturities over 90 days.

Level 2
    Fair Value Measurements

Commodity derivatives

— The fair values of
    commodity derivatives are estimated using internal discounted
    cash flow calculations based upon forward commodity price
    curves, quotes obtained from brokers for contracts with similar
    terms or quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements.
    The most significant input to the cash flow calculations is
    Devon’s estimate of future commodity prices. Devon bases
    its estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity
    price curves such as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for
    gas instruments and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward
    curve for oil instruments. Another key input to the cash flow
    calculations is Devon’s estimate of volatility for these
    forward curves, which is based primarily upon implied
    volatility. The resulting estimated future cash inflows or
    outflows over



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the lives of the contracts are discounted primarily using United
    States Treasury bill rates. These pricing and discounting inputs
    are sensitive to the period of the contract, as well as changes
    in forward prices and regional price differentials.

Interest rate derivatives

— The fair values of
    the interest rate derivatives are estimated using internal
    discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward
    interest-rate yield curves or quotes obtained from
    counterparties to the agreements. The most significant input to
    Devon’s cash flow calculations is its estimate of future
    interest rate yields. Devon bases its estimate of future yields
    upon its own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as
    the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by third parties.
    The resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the
    lives of the contracts are discounted using the LIBOR and money
    market futures rate. These yield and discounting inputs are
    sensitive to the period of the contract, as well as changes in
    forward interest rate yields.

Debt

— Devon’s Level 2 fixed-rate
    debt instruments do not actively trade in an established market.
    The fair values of this debt are estimated by discounting the
    principal and interest payments at rates available for debt with
    similar terms and maturity.

Level 3
    Fair Value Measurements

Debt

— Devon’s Level 3 debt consisted
    of the non-interest bearing promissory note discussed in
    Note 5. Due to the lack of an active market for
    Devon’s promissory note, quoted marked prices for this note
    were not available. Therefore, Devon used valuation techniques
    that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of
    its promissory note. The fair value of this debt is estimated
    using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon
    estimated future payment schedules and a 3.125% interest rate.
    As a result of using these inputs, Devon concluded the estimated
    fair value of its non-interest bearing promissory note
    approximated the carrying value as of December 31, 2010.

Long-term investments

— Devon’s long-term
    investments presented in the tables above consisted entirely of
    auction rate securities. Due to the auction failures discussed
    in Note 1 and the lack of an active market for Devon’s
    auction rate securities, quoted market prices for these
    securities were not available as of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009. Therefore, Devon used valuation
    techniques that rely on unobservable inputs to estimate the fair
    values of its long-term auction rate securities. These inputs
    were based on the AAA credit rating of the securities, the
    probability of full repayment of the securities considering the
    United States government guarantees of substantially all of the
    underlying student loans, the collection of all accrued interest
    to date and continued receipts of principal at par. As a result
    of using these inputs, Devon concluded the estimated fair values
    of its long-term auction rate securities approximated the par
    values as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
    At this time, Devon does not believe the values of its long-term
    securities are impaired.

Share-Based
    Compensation

On June 3, 2009, Devon’s stockholders adopted the 2009
    Long-Term Incentive Plan, which expires on June 2, 2019.
    This plan authorizes the Compensation Committee, which consists
    of non-management members of Devon’s Board of Directors, to
    grant nonqualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock
    awards, Canadian restricted stock units, performance units,
    stock appreciation rights and cash-out rights to eligible
    employees. The plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified
    stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units
    and stock appreciation rights to directors. A total of
    21.5 million shares of Devon common stock have been
    reserved for issuance pursuant to the plan. To calculate shares
    issued under the plan, options granted represent one share and
    other awards represent 1.84 shares.

Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2005,
    2003 and 1997 under which stock options and restricted stock
    awards were issued to key management and professional employees.
    Options granted under these plans remain exercisable by the
    employees owning such options, but no new options or restricted
    stock awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has
    stock options outstanding that were assumed as part of the
    acquisitions of Ocean and Mitchell Energy &
    Development Corp.

The following table presents the effects of share-based
    compensation included in Devon’s accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations. The vesting for certain share-based
    awards was accelerated as part of Devon’s strategic
    repositioning. The associated expense for these accelerated
    awards is included in restructuring costs in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations. See Note 13 for
    further details.

With the approval of Devon’s Compensation Committee, Devon
    modified the share-based compensation arrangements for certain
    of Devon’s executives in the second quarter of 2008. The
    modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who
    meet certain

years-of-service

and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding
    share-based grants. As a condition to receiving the benefits of
    these modifications, the executives must agree not to use or
    disclose Devon’s confidential information and not to
    solicit Devon’s employees and customers. The executives are
    required to agree to these conditions at retirement and again in
    each subsequent year until all grants have vested.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of
    the executives’ grants, it does accelerate the expense
    recognition as executives approach the

years-of-service

and age criteria. When the modification was made in the second
    quarter of 2008, certain executives had already met the

years-of-service

and age criteria. As a result, Devon recognized an additional
    $27 million of share-based compensation expense in the
    second quarter of 2008 related to this modification. This
    additional expense would have been recognized in future
    reporting periods if the modification had not been made and the
    executives continued their employment at Devon.

Stock
    Options

Under Devon’s 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options granted may not be less than the market
    value of the stock at the date of grant. In addition, options
    granted are exercisable during a period established for each
    grant, which may not exceed eight years from the date of grant.
    The recipient must pay the exercise price in cash or in common
    stock, or a combination thereof, at the time that the option is
    exercised. Options granted generally have a vesting period that
    ranges from three to four years.

The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed
    over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the fair
    values of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model, which requires Devon to make several
    assumptions. The volatility of Devon’s common stock is
    based on the historical volatility of the market price of
    Devon’s common stock over a period of time equal to the
    expected term of the option and ending on the grant date. The
    dividend yield is based on Devon’s historical and current
    yield in effect at the date of grant. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on the zero-coupon United States Treasury yield
    for the expected term of the option at the date of grant. The
    expected term of the options is based on historical exercise and
    termination experience for various groups of employees and
    directors. Each group is determined based on the similarity of
    their historical exercise and termination behavior.

The following table presents a summary of the grant-date fair
    values of stock options granted and the related assumptions. All
    such amounts represent the weighted-average amounts for each
    year.

    $51 million and $263 million, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2010, Devon’s unrecognized compensation
    cost related to unvested stock options was $65 million.
    Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 2.8 years.

Restricted
    Stock Awards and Units

Under Devon’s 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, restricted
    stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions,
    restrictions and limitations, if any, that the Compensation
    Committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued
    employment. Generally, restricted stock awards and units vest
    over a minimum restriction period of at least three years from
    the date of grant. During the vesting period, recipients of
    restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject
    to restrictions or other limitations. The fair value of
    restricted stock awards and units on the date of grant is
    expensed over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the
    fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing
    price of Devon’s common stock on the grant date of the
    award or unit.

    recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.

Restructuring
    Costs

Employee
    Severance

In the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon recognized
    $153 million of estimated employee severance costs
    associated with the planned divestiture of its offshore assets
    that was announced in November 2009. This amount was based on
    estimates of the number of employees that would ultimately be
    impacted by the divestitures and included amounts related to
    cash severance costs and accelerated vesting of share-based
    grants. Of the $153 million total, $105 million
    related to Devon’s U.S. Offshore operations and the
    remainder related to its International discontinued operations.

As discussed in Note 5, during 2010 Devon divested all of
    its U.S. Offshore assets and a significant part of its
    International assets. As a result of these divestitures and
    associated employee terminations, Devon decreased its estimate
    of employee severance costs in 2010 by $31 million. More
    offshore employees than previously estimated received comparable
    positions with either the purchaser of the properties or in
    Devon’s U.S. Onshore operations, and this caused the
    $31 million decrease to the severance estimate. This
    decrease includes $27 million related to Devon’s
    U.S. Offshore operations and $4 million related to its
    International discontinued operations.

Lease
    Obligations

As a result of the divestitures discussed above, Devon ceased
    using certain office space that was subject to non-cancellable
    operating lease arrangements. Consequently, in 2010, Devon
    recognized $70 million of restructuring costs that
    represent the present value of its future obligations under the
    leases, net of anticipated sublease income. Devon’s
    estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key
    estimates that could change over the term of the leases. These
    estimates include the estimated sublease income that Devon may
    receive over the term of the leases, as well as the amount of
    variable operating costs that Devon will be required to pay
    under the leases.

Asset
    Impairments

In 2010, Devon recognized $11 million of asset impairment
    charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with
    the office space it ceased using.

Until October 31, 2008, Devon owned 14.2 million
    shares of Chevron common stock. These shares were held in
    connection with debt owed by Devon that contained an exchange
    option. The exchange option allowed the debt holders, prior to
    the debt’s maturity of August 15, 2008, to exchange
    the debt for shares of Chevron common stock owned by Devon.
    However, Devon had the option to settle any exchanges with cash
    equal to the market value of Chevron common stock at the time of
    the exchange. Devon settled remaining exchange requests during
    2008 by paying $1.0 billion. On October 31, 2008,
    Devon transferred its 14.2 million shares of Chevron common
    stock to Chevron. In exchange, Devon received Chevron’s
    interest in the Drunkard’s Wash coalbed natural gas field
    in east-central Utah and $280 million in cash.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2009 and 2008, Devon reduced the carrying values of
    certain of its oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations. A summary of these reductions and additional
    discussion is provided below.

The 2009 reduction was recognized in the first quarter and the
    2008 reductions were recognized in the fourth quarter. The
    reductions resulted from significant decreases in each
    country’s full cost ceiling compared to the immediately
    preceding quarter. The lower United States ceiling value in the
    first quarter of 2009 largely resulted from the effects of
    declining natural gas prices subsequent to December 31,
    2008. The lower ceiling values in the fourth quarter of 2008
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil, gas
    and NGL prices compared to September 30, 2008.

Deep water Gulf of Mexico leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or gas
    exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty relief would
    not be granted for that year. In October 2007, a federal
    district court ruled in favor of a plaintiff who had challenged
    the legality of including price thresholds in deep water leases.
    This judgment was later appealed to the United States Supreme
    Court, which, in October 2009, declined to review the appellate
    court’s ruling. The Supreme Court’s decision ended the
    MMS’s judicial course to enforce the price thresholds. At
    the time of the Supreme Court’s decision, Devon had
    $84 million accrued for potential royalties on various deep
    water leases. Based upon the Supreme Court’s decision,
    Devon reduced to zero the $84 million loss contingency
    accrual in 2009.

In 2008, Devon recognized $162 million of excess insurance
    recoveries for damages suffered in 2005 related to hurricanes
    that struck the Gulf of Mexico. The excess recoveries resulted
    from business interruption claims on policies that were in
    effect when the 2005 hurricanes occurred.

During 2010 and 2009, pursuant to the completed and planned
    divestitures of its International assets located outside North
    America, a portion of Devon’s foreign earnings were no
    longer deemed to be permanently reinvested. Accordingly, Devon
    recognized deferred tax expense of $144 million and
    $55 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to
    assumed repatriations of earnings from certain of its foreign
    subsidiaries.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2008, Devon recognized $312 million of additional
    income tax expense that resulted from two related factors
    associated with its foreign operations. First, during 2008,
    Devon repatriated $2.6 billion from certain foreign
    subsidiaries to the United States. Second, Devon made certain
    tax policy election changes in the second quarter of 2008 to
    minimize the taxes it otherwise would pay for the cash
    repatriations, as well as the taxable gains associated with the
    sales of assets in West Africa. As a result of the repatriation
    and tax policy election changes, Devon recognized
    $295 million of additional current tax expense and
    $17 million of additional deferred tax expense.

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
    $957 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
    2010. Included in total deferred tax assets is $159 million
    related to various carryforwards available to offset future
    income taxes. The carryforwards consist of $538 million of
    Canadian net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between
    2023 and 2030, and $161 million of state net operating loss
    carryforwards, which expire primarily between 2011 and 2024. The
    tax benefits of carryforwards are recorded as an asset to the
    extent that management assesses the utilization of such
    carryforwards to be “more likely than not.” When the
    future utilization of some portion of the carryforwards is
    determined not to be “more likely than not,” a
    valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded tax
    benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the Canadian net operating
    loss carryforward to be utilized between 2011 and 2016. Also,
    Devon expects the tax benefits from the state net operating loss
    carryforwards to be utilized between 2012 and 2015. Such
    expectations are based upon current estimates of taxable income
    during these periods, considering limitations on the annual
    utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax regulations.
    Significant changes in such estimates caused by variables such
    as future oil and gas prices or capital expenditures could alter
    the timing of the eventual utilization of such carryforwards.
    There can be no

assurance that Devon will generate any specific level of
    continuing taxable earnings. However, management believes that
    Devon’s future taxable income will more likely than not be
    sufficient to utilize substantially all its tax carryforwards
    prior to their expiration.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately $4.3 billion of
    Devon’s unremitted earnings from its foreign subsidiaries
    were deemed to be permanently reinvested. As a result, Devon has
    not recognized a deferred tax liability for United States income
    taxes associated with such earnings. If such earnings were to be
    remitted to the United States, Devon may be subject to United
    States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. However, it
    is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that
    may be payable due to the inter-relationship of the various
    factors involved in making such an estimate.

    open tax years. In addition, Devon is currently subject to
    various income tax audits that have not reached the
    administrative review process. As a result, Devon cannot
    reasonably anticipate the extent that the liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the
    next twelve months.

Reductions
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2009 and 2008, Devon reduced the carrying values of
    certain of its oil and gas properties that are now held for

    limitations. A summary of these reductions and additional

Brazil’s 2009 reduction resulted largely from an

    Barreirinhas Basin. After drilling this well in the first
    quarter of 2009, Devon concluded that the well did not have
    adequate reserves for commercial viability. As a result, the
    seismic, leasehold and drilling costs associated with this well
    contributed to the reduction recognized in the first quarter of
    2009.

Brazil’s 2008 reduction was recognized in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and resulted primarily from a significant
    decrease in its full cost ceiling. The lower ceiling value
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil
    prices compared to previous quarter-end prices.

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

The following table reconciles earnings from continuing
    operations and common shares outstanding used in the
    calculations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share.
    Because a net loss from continuing operations was incurred
    during 2009 and 2008, the dilutive shares produce an
    antidilutive net loss per share result.

Segment
    Information

Devon manages its North American onshore operations through six
    distinct operating segments, or divisions, which are defined
    primarily by geographic areas. For financial reporting purposes,
    Devon aggregates its United States divisions into one reporting
    segment due to the similar nature of the businesses. However,
    Devon’s Canadian and International divisions are reported
    as separate reporting segments primarily due to significant
    differences in the respective regulatory environments.

Devon’s segments are all primarily engaged in oil and gas
    producing activities, and certain information regarding such
    activities for each segment is included in Note 22.
    Following is certain financial information regarding
    Devon’s segments for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The revenues
    reported are all from external customers.

Results
    of Operations

The following tables include revenues and expenses directly
    associated with Devon’s oil and gas producing activities,
    including general and administrative expenses directly related
    to such producing activities. They do not include any allocation
    of Devon’s interest costs or general corporate overhead
    and, therefore, are not necessarily indicative of the
    contribution to net earnings of Devon’s oil and gas
    operations. Income tax expense has been calculated by applying
    statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and NGL sales after
    deducting costs, including depreciation, depletion and
    amortization and after giving effect to permanent differences.

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the
    relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids
    reserves are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.

2010 —

Reserves increased 72 MMBoe due to
    higher gas prices, partially offset by the effect of higher oil
    prices. The higher oil prices increased Devon’s Canadian
    royalty burden, which reduced Devon’s oil reserves. Of the
    72 MMBoe price revisions, 43 MMBoe related to the
    Barnett Shale in north Texas and 22 MMBoe related to the
    Rocky Mountain area.


— Reserves increased 177 MMBoe due to
    higher oil prices, partially offset by lower gas prices. The
    increase in oil reserves primarily related to Devon’s
    Jackfish thermal heavy oil reserves in Canada. At the end of
    2008, 331 MMBoe of reserves related to Jackfish were not
    considered proved. However, due to higher prices, these reserves
    were considered proved as of December 31, 2009.
    Significantly lower gas prices caused Devon’s reserves to
    decrease 116 MMBoe, which primarily related to its United
    States reserves.


— Due to significantly lower oil, gas and
    NGL prices as of December 31, 2008 compared to
    December 31, 2007, 487 MMBoe of reserves were not
    considered proved as of December 31, 2008. Of the
    487 MMBoe price revisions, 331 MMBoe related to
    Jackfish.

The 487 MMBoe price revision also included 28 MMBoe
    related to Devon’s proved reserves in the Canadian province
    of Alberta. In December 2008, the provincial government of
    Alberta enacted a new royalty regime. The new regime for
    conventional oil, gas, NGL and heavy oil production was
    effective January 1, 2009. As a result of the newly enacted
    royalties, Devon’s proved reserves decreased as of
    December 31, 2008.

Revisions
    Other Than Price

Total revisions other than price for 2010, 2009 and 2008
    primarily related to Devon’s drilling and development in
    the Barnett Shale.

Extensions
    and Discoveries

2010 —

Of the 354 MMBoe of 2010 extensions
    and discoveries, 101 MMBoe related to the Cana-Woodford
    Shale in western Oklahoma, 87 MMBoe related to the Barnett
    Shale, 55 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 19 MMBoe related
    to the Permian Basin, 15 MMBoe related to the Rocky
    Mountain area and 14 MMBoe related to the Carthage area in
    east Texas.

The 2010 extensions and discoveries included 107 MMBoe
    related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling
    activities, including 43 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale and
    47 MMBoe at the Cana-Woodford Shale.


— Of the 458 MMBoe of 2009 extensions
    and discoveries, 204 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale,
    118 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 49 MMBoe related to the
    Cana-Woodford Shale, 14 MMBoe related to the Rocky Mountain
    area, 11 MMBoe related to Deepwater Production in the Gulf,
    8 MMBoe related to the Carthage conventional area, and
    7 MMBoe related to the Haynesville Shale area in east Texas.

The 2009 extensions and discoveries included 371 MMBoe
    related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling
    activities, including 203 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale,
    118 MMBoe at Jackfish and 24 MMBoe at the
    Cana-Woodford Shale.


— Of the 546 MMBoe of 2008 extensions
    and discoveries, 252 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale,
    101 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 44 MMBoe related to
    Carthage conventional, 21 MMBoe related to the
    Cana-Woodford Shale, 19 MMBoe related to the Lloydminster
    heavy oil development in Canada and 17 MMBoe related to the
    Arkoma-Woodford Shale area in southeastern Oklahoma.

The 2008 extensions and discoveries included 420 MMBoe
    related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling
    activities, including 243 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale,
    101 MMBoe at Jackfish, 22 MMBoe at Carthage
    conventional, 18 MMBoe at Lloydminster and 11 MMBoe at
    the Cana-Woodford Shale.

Purchase
    of Reserves

The 2008 total included 34 MMBoe located in Utah and
    27 MMBoe located in the Permian Basin.

Sale of
    Reserves

The 2010 total primarily relates to the divestiture of
    Devon’s Gulf of Mexico properties.

SEC’s
    Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

At the end of 2009, Devon adopted the SEC’s

Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

, as well as the
    conforming rule changes issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. Upon adoption, the two primary rule changes
    that impacted Devon’s year-end reserves estimates were
    those related to assumptions for pricing and reasonable
    certainty.

The SEC’s prior rules required proved reserve estimates to
    be calculated using prices as of the end of the period and held
    constant over the life of the reserves. The revised rules
    require reserves estimates to be calculated using an average of
    the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the preceding

12-month

period.

The revised rules amend the definition of proved reserves to
    permit the use of reliable technologies to establish the
    reasonable certainty of proved reserves. This revision includes
    provisions for establishing levels of lowest known hydrocarbons
    and highest known oil through reliable technology other than
    well penetrations. This revision also allows proved reserves to
    be claimed beyond development spacing areas that are immediately
    adjacent to developed spacing areas if economic producibility
    can be established with reasonable certainty based on reliable
    technologies. As a result of adopting these provisions of the
    new rules, Devon’s 2009 reserves increased approximately
    65 MMBoe, or 2%. This increase is included in the 2009
    extensions and discoveries total.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. The Society of Petroleum
    Engineers’ definition of an audit is an examination of a
    company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow by
    an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation methods and procedures.

In 2010, the U.S. reserves were evaluated by the
    independent petroleum consultants of LaRoche Petroleum
    Consultants, Ltd. In 2009 and 2008, the U.S. reserves were
    evaluated by the independent petroleum

DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Future cash inflows, development costs and production costs were
    computed using the same assumptions for prices and costs that
    were used to estimate Devon’s proved oil and gas reserves
    at the end of each year. For 2010, the prices averaged $59.94
    per barrel of oil, $3.73 per Mcf of gas and $31.11 per barrel of
    natural gas liquids. Of the $10,746 million of future
    development costs as of the end of 2010, $1,418 million,
    $1,447 million and $972 million are estimated to be
    spent in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
    also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
    Included as part of the $10,746 million of future
    development costs are $2,263 million of future
    dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
    expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
    Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
    appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
    flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
    properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
    to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
    impact of future operations.

The principal changes in the standardized measure of discounted
    future net cash flows attributable to Devon’s proved
    reserves are as follows:

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
    that material information relating to Devon, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
    certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
    senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
    principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective
    as of December 31, 2010 to ensure that the information
    required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files
    or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for Devon, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision
    and with the participation of Devon’s management, including
    our principal executive and principal financial officers, Devon
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this
    evaluation under the COSO Framework, which was completed on
    February 21, 2011, management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
    firm who audited Devon’s consolidated financial statements
    as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, as stated
    in their report, which is included under “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2010 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B.

Other
    Information

Danny Heatly, our Senior Vice President, Accounting and Chief
    Accounting Officer, has notified Devon of his retirement,
    effective March 4, 2011. In connection with
    Mr. Heatly’s retirement, Mr. Heatly and Devon
    entered into a Retirement Agreement, dated February 23,
    2011 (the “Retirement Agreement”), in which Devon
    agreed to provide continued vesting of Mr. Heatly’s
    outstanding equity awards and Mr. Heatly made certain
    representations and covenants in favor of Devon. The Retirement
    Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.21 to this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Following Mr. Heatly’s retirement, Jeffrey A. Agosta,
    43, Devon’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
    Officer will also serve as principal accounting officer.
