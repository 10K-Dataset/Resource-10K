PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries,
(“Devon”) is an independent energy company engaged
primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and
production, the acquisition of producing properties, the
transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the processing of
natural gas. Through its predecessors, Devon began operations in
1971 as a privately held company. In 1988, Devon’s common
stock began trading publicly on the American Stock Exchange
under the symbol “DVN”. In October 2004, Devon
transferred its common stock listing to the New York Stock
Exchange.

The principal and administrative offices of Devon are located at
20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK 73102-8260 (telephone
405/235-3611).

Devon operates oil and gas properties in the United States,
Canada and various regions located outside North America.
Devon’s North American properties are concentrated within
five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are
focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid-Continent, the Rocky
Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast. Canadian
properties are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin
in Alberta and British Columbia. Properties outside North
America are located primarily in Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, and
areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and
Cote d’Ivoire. In addition to its oil and gas operations,
Devon has marketing and midstream operations. These include
marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and the construction
and operation of pipelines, storage and treating facilities and
gas processing plants. (A detailed description of Devon’s
significant properties and associated 2004 developments can be
found under “Item 2. Properties”).

At December 31, 2004, Devon’s estimated proved
reserves were 2,077 MMBoe, of which 60% were natural gas
reserves and 40% were oil and NGL reserves.

Availability of Reports

Devon makes available free of charge on its internet website,
www.devonenergy.com, its Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after it
electronically files or furnishes them to the SEC.

Strategy

Devon’s primary objectives are to build reserves,
production, cash flow and earnings per share by
(a) exploring for new oil and gas reserves,
(b) acquiring oil and gas properties and
(c) optimizing production and value from existing oil and
gas properties. Devon’s management seeks to achieve these
objectives by (a) concentrating its properties in core
areas to achieve economies of scale, (b) acquiring and
developing high profit margin properties, (c) continually
disposing of marginal and non-strategic properties,
(d) balancing reserves between oil and gas,
(e) maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility, and
(f) enhancing the value of Devon’s production and
reserves through marketing and midstream activities.

Development of Business

During 1988, Devon expanded its capital base with its first
issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a
substantial expansion program that has continued through the
subsequent years. Devon has used a two-pronged strategy of
acquiring producing properties and engaging in drilling
activities to achieve this expansion. Total proved reserves
increased from 8 MMBoe at year-end 1987 (without giving
effect to the 1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of
interests) to 2,077 MMBoe at year-end 2004.



During the same time period, proved reserves have grown from
0.66 Boe per diluted share at year-end 1987 (without giving
effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 4.16 Boe per
diluted share at year-end 2004. This represents a compound
annual growth rate of 11%. Another measure of value per share is
oil and gas production per share. Production increased from
0.09 Boe per diluted share in 1987 (without giving effect
to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 0.50 Boe per diluted
share in 2004, a compound annual growth rate of 11%.

During 2004, Devon drilled 274 exploration wells and over 1,900
development wells. See further discussion of Devon’s 2004
exploration and drilling efforts in “Item 2.
Properties.”

Cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion for 2004. This
allowed Devon to fully fund its $3.1 billion of capital
expenditures, retire approximately $1 billion in long-term
debt and add $846 million to cash and short-term
investments. The $2.1 billion of cash and short-term
investments as of December 31, 2004, is adequate to cover
debt maturities through 2007.

On September 27, 2004, Devon announced two significant
initiatives. First, Devon plans to divest oil and gas properties
in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the United States
and Canada, representing approximately 9% of proved North
American reserves. By divesting these properties, Devon expects
to lengthen the overall reserve life and lower the overall cost
structure and improve operating efficiency of its retained
properties. Devon began the divestiture process in the fourth
quarter of 2004 and expects to complete the sale of most of the
properties in the first half of 2005. After-tax sale proceeds
are expected to range between $1.0 billion and
$1.5 billion and will be used to partially fund the stock
buyback program described below.

Second, Devon announced a stock buyback program to repurchase up
to 50 million shares of its common stock. Devon began
repurchasing its shares in the open market during October 2004.
As of February 28, 2005, Devon had repurchased
12.5 million shares at a total cost of $501 million,
or $40.04 per share. Devon intends to continue repurchasing
its shares in the open market and in privately negotiated
transactions, depending upon market conditions. The shares will
be repurchased with cash flow from operations and proceeds from
the planned sales of oil and gas properties discussed
previously. The stock repurchase program may be discontinued at
any time.

Additionally, Devon announced the declaration of a two-for-one
split of Devon’s outstanding common stock. The stock split
was applicable to stockholders of record at the close of
business on October 29, 2004. The stock split was
accomplished through a stock dividend paid on November 15,
2004. All references in this document to shares of Devon common
stock, or to amounts based on shares of such stock outstanding,
have been adjusted retroactively for the effect of this stock
split.

On April 25, 2003, Devon completed its merger with Ocean
Energy, Inc. (“Ocean”). In the transaction, Devon
issued 0.828 shares of its common stock for each
outstanding share of Ocean common stock, or a total of
approximately 148 million shares. Also, Devon assumed
approximately $1.8 billion of debt from Ocean. The Ocean
merger added approximately 554 million Boe to Devon’s
proved reserves.

On January 24, 2002, Devon completed its merger with
Mitchell Energy & Development Corp.
(“Mitchell”). Under the terms of this merger, Devon
issued approximately 60 million shares of Devon common
stock and paid $1.6 billion in cash to the Mitchell
stockholders. The Mitchell merger added approximately
404 million Boe to Devon’s proved reserves.

On October 15, 2001, Devon acquired Anderson Exploration
Ltd. (“Anderson”) for approximately $3.5 billion
in cash. The Anderson acquisition added approximately
534 million Boe to Devon’s proved reserves.

To fund the cash portions of the Mitchell merger and the
Anderson acquisition, as well as to pay related transaction
costs and retire certain long-term debt assumed from Mitchell
and Anderson, Devon entered into long-term debt agreements in
October 2001 that totaled $6 billion. Half of this total
consisted of $3 billion of notes and debentures issued on
October 3, 2001. Of this total, $1.25 billion bears
interest



at 7.875% and matures in September 2031. The remaining
$1.75 billion bears interest at 6.875% and matures in
September 2011.

The remaining $3 billion of the $6 billion of
long-term debt was borrowed under a credit facility that was
repaid in 2004. The primary sources of the repayments were the
issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, of which
$1.3 billion was used to pay down the credit facility with
the remainder used to pay down other debt; $1.4 billion
from the sale of certain oil and gas properties in 2002, of
which $1.1 billion was used to pay down the credit
facility; and cash flow from operations.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographical
Areas

Notes 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements
included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
Devon’s segments and geographical areas.

Drilling Activities

Devon is engaged in numerous drilling activities on properties
presently owned and intends to drill or develop other properties
acquired in the future. Devon’s 2005 drilling activities
will be focused in the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin,
Mid-Continent, Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas in
the U.S., the Western Sedimentary basin of Canada, and in
Brazil, China, Egypt, Russia and West Africa outside North
America.

The following tables set forth the results of Devon’s
drilling activity for the past five years.

(1)

Gross wells are the sum of all wells in which Devon owns an
    interest.

(2)

Net wells are the sum of Devon’s working interests in gross
    wells.

As of December 31, 2004, Devon was participating in the
drilling of 147 gross (90.64 net) wells in the U.S.,
53 gross (28.7 net) wells in Canada and 40 gross
(10.03 net) wells internationally. Of these wells, through
February 1, 2005, 61 gross (43.44 net) wells in
the U.S., 6 gross (3.83 net) wells in Canada, and
2 gross (0.74 net) wells internationally had been
completed as productive. An additional 3 gross (3 net)
wells in Canada were dry holes. The remaining wells were still
in progress.

Customers

Devon sells its gas production to a variety of customers
including pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial
users and local distribution companies. Existing gathering
systems and interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to
consummate gas sales and deliveries.

The principal customers for Devon’s crude oil production
are refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which
have pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the
event pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude
oil is trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline
facilities.

No purchaser accounted for over 10% of Devon’s revenues in
2004.

Oil and Natural Gas Marketing

The spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as
supply and demand factors in various regions of North America
fluctuate. In addition to fixed price contracts, Devon
periodically enters into financial hedging arrangements or firm
delivery commitments with a portion of its oil and gas
production. These activities are intended to support targeted
price levels and to manage Devon’s exposure to price
fluctuations. (See “Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”)



Oil Marketing

Devon’s oil production is sold under both long-term (one
year or more) and short-term (less than one year) agreements at
prices negotiated with third parties.

Natural Gas Marketing

Devon’s gas production is also sold under both long-term
and short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third
parties. Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February
2005, approximately 86% of Devon’s natural gas production
was sold under short-term contracts at variable or
market-sensitive prices. These market-sensitive sales are
referred to as “spot market” sales. Another 12% were
committed under various long-term contracts which dedicate the
natural gas to a purchaser for an extended period of time, but
still at market sensitive prices. Devon’s remaining gas
production was sold under long-term fixed price contracts.

Typically either the entire contract (in the case of short-term
contracts) or the price provisions of the contract (in the case
of long-term contracts) are re-negotiated from daily intervals
up to one-year intervals. The spot market has become
progressively more competitive in recent years. As a result,
prices on the spot market have been volatile.

Marketing and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of Devon’s marketing and midstream
group is to add value to Devon and other producers to whom Devon
provides such services by gathering, processing and marketing
oil and gas production in a timely and efficient manner.
Devon’s most significant marketing and midstream asset is
the Bridgeport processing plant and gathering system located in
North Texas. These facilities serve not only Devon’s gas
production from the Barnett Shale but also gas production of
other producers in the area.

Devon’s marketing and midstream revenue sources are
primarily: (1) selling NGLs that were either extracted from
the gas streams processed by Devon-owned plants or purchased
from third parties for marketing; and, (2) selling or
gathering gas that moves through its gathering systems.
Marketing and midstream costs and expenses are incurred from
(1) purchasing the gas streams entering Devon-owned
gathering systems and plants; (2) fuel needed to operate
its plants, compressors and related gathering facilities;
(3) purchasing third-party NGLs; and, (4) expenses
incurred operating its plants, gathering systems and related
facilities.

Competition

The oil and gas business is highly competitive. Devon encounters
competition from major integrated and independent oil and gas
companies in acquiring drilling prospects and properties,
contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained
personnel. Intense competition occurs with respect to marketing,
particularly of natural gas. Certain competitors have resources
that substantially exceed those of Devon.

Seasonal Nature of Business

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases
during the summer months and increases during the winter months.
Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes
lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities,
local distribution companies and industrial users utilize
natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their
anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also
lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.

Government Regulation

Devon’s operations are subject to various levels of
government controls and regulations in the United States, Canada
and international locations in which it operates.



United States Regulation

In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and gas
industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for
amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous
federal, state and local departments and agencies have issued
extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas
industry and its individual members, some of which carry
substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and
regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling,
pipelines, gas processing plants and production activities,
increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and
gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations
are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to
predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws
and regulations. Devon considers the cost of environmental
protection a necessary and manageable part of its business.
Devon has been able to plan for and comply with new
environmental initiatives without materially altering its
operating strategies.

Exploration and Production.

Devon’s United States
operations are subject to various types of regulation at the
federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes
requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding
requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing
spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving
permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain
materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating
the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells,
the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and
materials used in connection with drilling and production
activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon
which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of
wells and the transporting of production. Devon’s
operations are also subject to various conservation matters,
including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing
units or proration units, the number of wells which may be
drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas
properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling
or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other
states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may
make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In
addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of
production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting
or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the
ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations
is to limit the amounts of oil and gas Devon can produce from
its wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at
which Devon can drill.

Certain of Devon’s oil and gas leases, including its
offshore Gulf of Mexico leases, most of its leases in the
San Juan Basin and many of Devon’s leases in southeast
New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming, are granted by the federal
government and administered by various federal agencies,
including the Minerals Management Service of the Department of
the Interior (“MMS”). Such leases require compliance
with detailed federal regulations and orders which regulate,
among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by
these leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty
payments to the federal government. The MMS has been
particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some
cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding
competitive lease bidding and royalty payment obligations for
production from federal lands. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) also has jurisdiction over certain
offshore activities pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf
Lands Act.

Environmental and Occupational Regulations.

Various
federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the
discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the
generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants
or otherwise relating to the protection of public health,
natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect
Devon’s exploration, development, processing, and
production operations and the costs attendant thereto. These
laws and regulations increase Devon’s overall operating
expenses. Devon maintains levels of insurance customary in the
industry to limit its financial exposure in the event of a
substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden,
unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil, salt water or
other substances. However, 100% coverage is not maintained
concerning any environmental claim, and no coverage is
maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be
paid by Devon because of its violation of any federal, state or
local law. Devon is committed to meeting its responsibilities to
protect the environment wherever it operates and anticipates
making increased expenditures of both a capital and expense
nature as a result of the increasingly stringent laws



relating to the protection of the environment. Devon’s
unreimbursed expenditures in 2004 concerning such matters were
immaterial, but Devon cannot predict with any reasonable degree
of certainty its future exposure concerning such matters.

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
environmental remediation activities associated with past
operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these
activities, accruals have been established when reasonable
estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include
estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used
discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for
environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible
recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to
environmental costs have been recognized in Devon’s
consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals
when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation
estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of Devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers
are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
by third parties. As of December 31, 2004, Devon’s
consolidated balance sheet included $7 million of
non-current accrued liabilities, reflected in “Other
liabilities,” related to these and other environmental
remediation liabilities. Devon does not currently believe there
is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material
costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such
environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites
in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs, Devon’s conclusion is
based in large part on (i) Devon’s participation in
consent decrees with both other PRPs and the Environmental
Protection Agency, which provide for performing the scope of
work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue
as protection to the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as
a

de minimis PRP,

and (iii) the availability of
other defenses to liability. As a result, Devon’s monetary
exposure is not expected to be material.

Devon is also subject to laws and regulations concerning
occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in
these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of
same, Devon is unable to predict with any reasonable degree of
certainty its future costs of complying with these laws and
regulations. Devon considers the cost of safety and health
compliance a necessary and manageable part of its business.
Devon has been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives
without materially altering its operating strategies.

Devon maintains its own internal Environmental, Health and
Safety Department. This department is responsible for
instituting and maintaining an environmental and safety
compliance program for Devon. The program includes field
inspections of properties and internal assessments of
Devon’s compliance procedures.

Canadian Regulations

The oil and gas industry in Canada is subject to extensive
controls and regulations imposed by various levels of
government. It is not expected that any of these controls or
regulations will affect Devon’s Canadian operations in a
manner materially different than they would affect other oil and
gas companies of similar size. The following are the most
important areas of control and regulation.

Exploration and Production.

Devon’s Canadian
operations are subject to federal and provincial governmental
regulations. Such regulations include requiring licenses for the
drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells and the
method and ability to produce wells, surface usage and the
restoration of land upon which wells have been drilled, the
plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of
production from wells. Devon’s Canadian operations are also
subject to various conservation regulations, including the
regulation of the size of spacing units, the number of wells
which may be drilled in a unit, the unitization or pooling of
oil and gas properties, the rate of production allowable from
oil and gas wells, and the ability to produce oil and gas. In
Canada, the effect of such regulation is to limit the amounts of



oil and gas Devon can produce from its wells and to limit the
number of wells or the locations at which Devon can drill.

Royalties and Incentives.

Each province and the federal
government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing
land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes,
environmental protection and other matters under their
respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant
factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production.
Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown
lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown
royalties are determined by government regulation and are
generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross
production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon
prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical
location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the
petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments
of Canada, Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan have also
established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions,
royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging
oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects.
These incentives generally have the effect of increasing the
cash flow to the producer.

Pricing and Marketing.

The price of oil, natural gas and
NGLs sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and
sellers. An order from the National Energy Board
(“NEB”) is required for oil exports from Canada. Any
oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer
than one year, in the case of light crude, and two years, in the
case of heavy crude, requires an exporter to obtain an export
license from the NEB. The issue of such a license requires the
approval of the Government of Canada. Natural gas exported from
Canada is also subject to similar regulation by the NEB. Natural
gas exports for a term of less than two years, or for a term of
two to twenty years in quantities of not more than
20,000 Mcf per day, must be made pursuant to an NEB order.
Any natural gas exports to be made pursuant to a contract of
larger duration (to a maximum of 25 years) or in larger
quantities require an exporter to obtain a license from the NEB,
which requires the approval of the Government of Canada.
Exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with
purchasers, provided that the export contracts meet certain
criteria prescribed by the NEB. The governments of Alberta,
British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the volume of
natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for
consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve
availability, transportation arrangements and market
considerations.

Environmental Regulation.

The oil and natural gas
industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to
local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental
legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on
releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized
in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In
addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be
monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of
provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result
in the imposition of fines and penalties. Devon is committed to
meeting its responsibilities to protect the environment wherever
it operates and anticipates making increased expenditures of
both a capital and expense nature as a result of the
increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the
environment. Devon’s unreimbursed expenditures in 2004
concerning such matters were immaterial, but Devon cannot
predict with any reasonable degree of certainty its future
exposure concerning such matters.

The North American Free Trade Agreement.

The North
American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) which became
effective on January 1, 1994 carries forward most of the
material energy terms contained in the Canada-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement. In the context of energy resources, Canada
continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the
United States or Mexico will be allowed, provided that any
export restrictions do not (i) reduce the proportion of
energy exported relative to the supply of the energy resource;
(ii) impose an export price higher than the domestic price;
or (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply. All parties to
NAFTA are also prohibited from imposing minimum export or import
price requirements.

Kyoto Protocol.

In December 2002 the Government of Canada
ratified the Kyoto Protocol. This protocol calls for Canada to
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990
levels during the period between 2008 and 2012. On
February 16, 2005, as a result of Russian ratification, the
protocol



became legally binding. The protocol is expected to affect the
operation of all industries in Canada, including the oil and gas
industry. As details of the implementation of emissions
reduction initiatives related to this protocol have yet to be
announced, the effect on Devon cannot be determined at this time.

Investment Canada Act.

The Investment Canada Act requires
Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the
acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that
is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the
acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to
be a transaction requiring such approval.

International Regulations

The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of
regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil
and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review
for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation,
government agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations
binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members,
some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply.
Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and
gas exploration, drilling and production activities, increase
the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and
gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations
are frequently amended or reinterpreted, Devon is unable to
predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws
and regulations. The following are significant areas of
regulation.

Exploration and Production.

Devon’s oil and gas
concessions and operating licenses or permits are granted by
host governments and administered by various foreign government
agencies. Such foreign governments require compliance with
detailed regulations and orders which regulate, among other
matters, seismic, drilling and production operations on areas
covered by concessions and permits and calculation and
disbursement of royalty payments, taxes and minimum investments
to the government.

Regulations include requiring permits for acquiring seismic
data; drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order
to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans;
submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the
presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil
and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the
method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation,
storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection
with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the
restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled,
the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of
production. Devon’s operations are also subject to
regulations which may limit the number of wells or the locations
at which Devon can drill.

Production Sharing Contracts.

Many of Devon’s
international licenses are governed by Production Sharing
Contracts (“PSCs”) between the concessionaires and the
granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that define and
regulate the framework for investments, revenue sharing, and
taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries. Unlike most
domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms and time
limits of generally 30 years. Many PSCs allow for recovery
of investments including carried government percentages. PSCs
generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. For
example, at either higher production rates or higher cumulative
rates of return, PSCs allow governments to generally retain
higher fractions of revenue.

Environmental Regulations.

Various government laws and
regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials
into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation
and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of
public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment,
affect Devon’s exploration, development, processing and
production operations and the costs attendant thereto. In
general, this consists of preparing Environmental Impact
Assessments in order to receive required environmental permits
to conduct seismic acquisition, drilling or construction
activities. Such regulations also typically include requirements
to develop emergency response plans, waste management plans,
environmental protection plans and spill contingency plans. In
some countries, the application of worldwide standards, such as
ISO 14000 governing Environmental Management Systems, are
required to be implemented for international oil and gas
operations. Additionally, the Kyoto Protocol will have
requirements similar to those for Canada for the oil and gas
industry in Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt,



Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Russia. As details of the
implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related to
this protocol have yet to be announced, the effect on
Devon’s international operations, if any, cannot be
determined at this time.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, Devon’s staff consisted of
3,900 full-time employees. Devon believes that it has good
labor relations with its employees.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of Devon’s properties consist of
interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and
mineral acreage located in Devon’s core operating areas.
These interests entitle Devon to drill for and produce oil,
natural gas and NGLs from specific areas. Devon’s interests
are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser
extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits interests,
foreign government concessions and other forms of direct and
indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

Devon also has certain midstream assets, including natural gas
and NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Devon’s
most significant midstream assets are its Bridgeport assets
serving the Barnett Shale development in North Texas. These
assets include approximately 2,400 miles of pipeline, a
650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a
15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator.

Proved Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.
The reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change
substantially over time as a result of, among other things,
additional development activity, production history and
viability of production under varying economic conditions.
Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates
may occur in the future.

Devon’s policies regarding booking reserves
(1) require proved reserves to be in compliance with the
SEC definitions and guidance and (2) assign
responsibilities for reserves bookings to Devon’s Reserve
Evaluation Group (the “Group”). The policies also
require that reserve estimates be made by qualified reserves
estimators (“QREs”), as defined by the Society of
Petroleum Engineers’ standards. A list of QREs is kept by
the Senior Advisor — Corporate Reserves. All QREs are
required to receive education covering the fundamentals of SEC
proved reserves assignments.

The Group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and
certification and includes the Manager — E&P
Budgets and Reserves and the Senior Advisor —
Corporate Reserves. The Group reports independently of any of
Devon’s operating divisions. The Vice President —
Planning and Evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing
the Group and reports to the President of Devon.

No portion of the Group’s compensation is dependent on the
quantity of reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
reserves that are audited include major fields and major changes
(additions and revisions) to reserves. In addition, the Group
reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum
consultants as discussed below.

In addition to internal audits, Devon engages three independent
petroleum consulting firms to perform both external reserves
preparation and audits. Ryder Scott Company, L.P. prepared the
reserves estimates for all offshore Gulf of Mexico properties
and for 98% of the international proved reserves. LaRoche
Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the reserves estimates for
about 73% of the domestic onshore properties. AJM Petroleum
Consultants prepared estimates covering 22% of Devon’s
Canadian reserves.



Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were
evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2004, 2003 and
2002.

“Prepared” reserves are those estimates of quantities
of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum
consultant. “Audited” reserves are those quantities of
reserves which were estimated by Devon employees and audited by
an independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination
of a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash
flow by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted
for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such
estimates, in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated
and presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
engineering and evaluation principles.

Devon follows what it believes to be a rational approach not
only to recording oil and gas reserves, but also to subjecting
these reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants.
As discussed above, the reserve estimates for all of our Gulf of
Mexico and international properties are prepared by an
independent petroleum consulting firm every year (excluding 2%
of Devon’s 2004 and 2003 international reserves that were
estimated by in-house engineers). Additionally, in Canada an
independent petroleum consulting firm prepares approximately a
rolling one-third of our properties each year so that the
reserve estimates for substantially all the Canadian properties
are prepared by outside engineers over a three-year cycle.

For the U.S. onshore properties, reserve estimates of
individually significant properties are either prepared or
audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm, while
estimates of minor properties are prepared by in-house
engineers. This approach results in independent engineers
preparing or auditing over 50% of our U.S. onshore reserves
each year.

Over any three-year period, more than 95% of Devon’s
company-wide reserve estimates are prepared or audited by an
independent petroleum consulting firm. Devon believes this
approach provides a high degree of assurance about the validity
of our reserve estimates. This is evidenced by the fact that in
the past five years, Devon’s annual revisions to its
reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases
in individual years, have averaged approximately 2% of the
previous year’s estimate.

In addition to internal and external reviews, three independent
members of Devon’s Board of Directors have been assigned to
a Reserves Committee. The Reserves Committee assists the Board
of Directors with the oversight of (1) the annual review
and evaluation of Devon’s consolidated oil, gas and NGL
reserves; (2) the integrity of Devon’s reserves
evaluation and reporting system; (3) Devon’s
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to
reserves evaluation, preparation, and disclosure; (4) the
qualifications and independence of Devon’s independent
engineering consultants; and (5) Devon’s business
practices and ethical standards in relation to the preparation
and disclosure of reserves. The Reserves Committee meets at
lease twice a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and
periodically meets separately with Devon’s senior reserves
engineering personnel and its independent petroleum consultants.



The following table sets forth Devon’s estimated proved
reserves and the related estimated pre-tax future net revenues,
pre-tax 10% present value and after-tax standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2004.
These estimates correspond with the method used in presenting
the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas
Operations” in Note 18 to Devon’s Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein.

(1)

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    natural gas to oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of
    the relationship of gas to oil prices. NGL reserves are
    converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil. The respective



prices of gas and oil are affected by market conditions and
    other factors in addition to relative energy content.

(2)

Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future revenue
    to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of
    estimated production and development costs and site restoration
    and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not give effect to
    non-property related expenses such as debt service and future
    income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and
    amortization.

These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect
    as of December 31, 2004. These prices were not changed
    except where different prices were fixed and determinable from
    applicable contracts. Such contracts include derivatives
    accounted for as cash flow hedges. These assumptions yield
    average prices over the life of Devon’s properties of
    $34.69 per Bbl of oil, $5.27 per Mcf of natural gas
    and $29.73 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to
    December 31, 2004, New York Mercantile Exchange prices of
    $43.45 per Bbl for crude oil and $6.18 per MMBtu for
    natural gas.

Devon believes that the pre-tax 10% present value is a useful
    measure in addition to standardized measure as it assists in
    both the determination of future cash flows of the current
    reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among
    peer companies. The standardized measure is dependent on the
    unique tax situation of each individual company, while the
    pre-tax 10% present value is based on prices and discount
    factors which are consistent from company to company. We also
    understand that securities analysts use this measure in similar
    ways.

(3)

See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in Item 8 of this report.

As presented in the previous table, Devon had 1,652 MMBoe
of proved developed reserves at December 31, 2004. Proved
developed reserves consist of proved developed producing
reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The
following table provides additional information regarding
Devon’s proved developed reserves at December 31, 2004.



No estimates of Devon’s proved reserves have been filed
with or included in reports to any federal or foreign
governmental authority or agency since the beginning of the last
fiscal year except (i) in filings with the SEC and
(ii) in filings with the Department of Energy
(“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed by Devon with the SEC
correspond with the estimates of Devon reserves contained
herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the
same underlying technical and economic assumptions as the
estimates of Devon’s reserves included herein. However, the
DOE requires reports to include the interests of all owners in
wells that Devon operates and to exclude all interests in wells
that Devon does not operate.

The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect
market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to
December 31, 2004. There can be no assurance that all of
the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods
indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that
existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

Production, Revenue and Price History

Certain information concerning oil, natural gas and NGL
production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding
royalties and other third party interests) and operating
expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2004, is
set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Operation of Properties

The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the
responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or
operating agreements. The operator supervises production,
maintains production records, employs field personnel and
performs other functions.

Devon is the operator of 19,506 of its wells. As operator, Devon
receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
performance of its duties as well as monthly per-well producing
and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
in the area. In presenting its financial data, Devon records the
monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.

Organization Structure

Devon’s North American properties are concentrated within
five geographic areas. Operations in the United States are
focused in the Permian Basin, the Mid-Continent, the Rocky
Mountains and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian
properties are focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin
in Alberta and British Columbia. Properties outside North
America are located primarily in Azerbaijan, China, Egypt and
areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and
Cote d’Ivoire. Additionally, Devon has exploratory
interests, but no current producing assets, in other
international countries including Angola, Brazil, Nigeria and
Syria. Maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core
areas has allowed Devon to improve operating and capital
efficiency.



The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the
most significant geographic areas in which Devon’s
properties are located as of December 31, 2004.

United States

The following descriptions of Devon’s properties in the
United States are as of December 31, 2004. Devon plans to
divest certain of these properties in 2005. Information provided
below may be materially different after the planned divestitures.

Permian Basin

Devon’s Permian Basin assets are located in portions of
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. These assets include
conventional oil and gas properties producing from a wide
variety of geologic formations and depths. The Permian Basin
represented 9% of Devon’s proved reserves at
December 31, 2004.

Devon’s leasehold position in Southeast New Mexico
encompasses more than 117,000 net acres of developed lands
and 231,000 net acres of undeveloped land and minerals.
Historically, Devon has been a very active operator in this
area, developing gas from the high productivity Morrow formation
and oil in the lower risk Delaware formation.



In the West Texas portion of the Permian Basin, Devon maintains
a base of oil production with long-life reserves. Many of these
reserves are from both operated and non-operated positions in
large enhanced oil recovery units such as the Wasson ODC Unit,
the Willard Unit, the Reeves Unit, the North Welch Unit and the
Anton Irish (Clearfork) Unit. These oil-producing units often
exhibit low decline rates. Devon also owns a significant acreage
position in West Texas with over 210,000 net acres of
developed lands and over 232,000 net acres of undeveloped
land and minerals at December 31, 2004.

Mid-Continent

The Mid-Continent region includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma
and Kansas. These areas encompass a wide variety of geologic
formations and productive depths and produce both oil and
natural gas. Devon’s Mid-Continent production has
historically come from conventional oil and gas properties.
However, the Barnett Shale in North Texas, acquired by Devon in
2002, is a non-conventional gas resource. The Mid-Continent
region represented 20% of Devon’s proved reserves at
December 31, 2004. Approximately 77% of Devon’s proved
reserves in the Mid-Continent area are in the Barnett Shale.

The Barnett Shale, Devon’s largest producing field, is
known as a tight gas formation. This means that in its natural
state, the formation is resistant to the production of natural
gas. However, the application of available technology has made
the Barnett Shale a low-risk and highly profitable natural gas
operation. Devon holds 535,000 net acres and over 1,900
producing wells in the Barnett Shale. Devon’s average
working interest is approximately 95%.

Devon has experienced success extracting gas from the Barnett
Shale by using light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing
yields better results than earlier techniques, is less expensive
and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing
wells to increase production rates. Devon is also applying
horizontal drilling, closer well spacing and reservoir
optimization techniques to further enhance the value of the
Barnett Shale.

Devon’s marketing and midstream operations gather and
process its Barnett Shale production along with Barnett Shale
production from unrelated third parties. The gathering system
consists of approximately 2,400 miles of pipeline, a
650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a
15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator.

In 2005, Devon plans to drill a total of 226 new Barnett Shale
wells including 156 horizontals and 70 verticals. About
two-thirds of the horizontal wells will be drilled outside the
core development area in an effort to further expand the
productive area of the field. The Barnett Shale is expected to
continue to be an important producing area for Devon for the
foreseeable future. Current net production from the Barnett
Shale is approximately 93 MBoe per day.

Rocky Mountain

Devon’s operations in the Rocky Mountain region include
properties in Wyoming, Montana, Utah, and Northern New Mexico.
These assets include conventional oil and gas properties and
coalbed natural gas projects. As of December 31, 2004, the
Rocky Mountain region comprised 9% of Devon’s proved
reserves.

Approximately 19% of Devon’s proved reserves in the Rocky
Mountains are from coalbed natural gas. Devon began producing
coalbed natural gas in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in
the mid-1980s and began drilling coalbed natural gas wells in
the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of
December 31, 2004, Devon had approximately 1,360 producing
coalbed natural gas wells in the Powder River Basin.
Devon’s net coalbed natural gas production from the basin
was approximately 76 MMcf per day as of December 31,
2004. Devon plans to drill 120 new wells and deepen
44 existing wells in the Powder River Basin in 2005.
Current production in the basin is primarily from the Wyodak
coal formation. Development of the deeper Big George formation
is expanding the play into the western portion of the Powder
River Basin. Devon also plans to plug and abandon 100 wells
in the Powder River Basin in 2005.



Devon’s most significant conventional gas project in the
Rocky Mountain region is the Washakie field in Wyoming. Devon is
continuing to develop and grow production from this field. In
2004, Devon added 62 producing wells in the Washakie field and
plans to drill another 84 wells in 2005. Devon has
interests in over 200,000 gross acres and an inventory of
more than 300 drilling locations. Devon’s current net
production from Washakie is approximately 15 MBoe
per day.

Gulf Coast Onshore

Devon’s Gulf Coast onshore properties are located in South
and East Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Most of the wells in
the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations.
At December 31, 2004, the Gulf Coast accounted for
approximately 12% of Devon’s proved reserves.

Devon’s operations in South Texas have focused on
exploration in the Edwards, Wilcox and Frio/ Vicksburg
formations. Devon has high working interests, up to 100%, in
several producing fields.

East Texas is an important conventional gas producing region for
Devon. Carthage and Groesbeck are two of the primary producing
areas. Wells produce from the Cotton Valley sands, the Travis
Peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates. Devon has
interests in nearly 1,900 producing wells in East Texas and
plans to drill 106 wells in Carthage and 37 wells in
Groesbeck in 2005. Devon’s current net production from East
Texas is about 42 MBoe per day.

Gulf Offshore

The offshore Gulf of Mexico accounted for 16% of Devon’s
2004 production and 8% of year-end proved reserves. Devon is
among the largest independent oil and gas producers in the Gulf
of Mexico and operates 450 platforms and caissons. Gulf of
Mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth.
The shelf is defined by water depths of 600 feet or less.
The deep water is at depths beyond 600 feet. Devon operates
in both the shelf and deepwater areas. However, Devon expects to
divest a significant number of its Gulf of Mexico shelf
producing assets in 2005.

In 2004, Devon commenced production from two new deepwater
fields. Red Hawk (Garden Banks 876) commenced production in
July and is currently producing in excess of 120 MMcf of
gas per day. Devon has a 50% working interest in Red Hawk.
Magnolia (Garden Banks 783) began producing oil and gas in
December. In February 2005, Magnolia was producing about
7 MBoe per day net to Devon’s 25% working interest
from two of an expected eight total producing wells.

In addition to its producing properties, Devon has a significant
inventory of exploration prospects in the Gulf of Mexico. Devon
has an interest in 85 undeveloped blocks on the shelf and
526 undeveloped deepwater blocks.

On the shallow-water shelf, the industry is beginning to explore
for oil and gas reserves at depths in excess of
15,000 feet. Devon has an interest in 28 of these
“deep shelf” prospects and expects to drill as many as
8 deep shelf exploratory wells during 2005.

In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, almost all historical
production of oil and gas has been from Miocene aged reservoirs.
Devon currently produces approximately 55 MBoe per day from
the deepwater Gulf and has an inventory of 18 undrilled
Miocene prospects. During 2005, Devon expects to drill
exploratory wells on four Miocene prospects.

In recent years, the industry has begun to explore for oil below
the Miocene in older formations that are collectively referred
to as the “lower Tertiary.” To date, Devon has
participated in three lower Tertiary discoveries and has an
interest in 23 additional undrilled lower Tertiary
prospects.

Cascade (Walker Ridge 206) was drilled in 2002 and was
Devon’s first discovery in the lower Tertiary trend. Devon
has a 25% working interest in the discovery and expects to drill
an appraisal well on the prospect in 2005. Devon’s second
lower tertiary discovery was in 2003 at St. Malo (Walker
Ridge 678). During 2004, Devon appraised the St. Malo
discovery with a second well. The St. Malo appraisal well
encountered more than 400 net feet of oil pay. Devon has a
22.5% working interest in



St. Malo and plans to drill a second appraisal well on the
St. Malo prospect in 2005. In 2004, Devon drilled its third
lower Tertiary discovery at Jack (Walker Ridge 759). The
Jack well encountered more than 350 net feet of oil pay.
Devon has a 25% working interest in Jack and plans to drill an
appraisal well on the prospect in 2005. In addition, Devon plans
to test at least one additional lower Tertiary prospect during
2005.

Canada

Devon is among the largest independent oil and gas producers in
Canada and operates in most of the producing basins in Western
Canada. As of December 31, 2004, 29% of Devon’s proved
reserves were Canadian. Devon’s Canadian assets will be
reduced by the planned 2005 non-core property divestiture
program.

Many of the Canadian basins where Devon operates are accessible
for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen.
Consequently, the winter season, from December through March, is
the most active drilling period. Devon expects to drill about
400 wells in the 2004-2005 winter program and spend
$475 million, or nearly half of the full year Canadian
capital budget.

The Deep Basin in West-Central Alberta accounted for 16% of
Devon’s Canadian proved reserves at December 31, 2004.
Devon holds 480,000 net undeveloped acres in the Deep
Basin, where it drilled 187 wells in 2004 and has another
very active drilling program planned for 2005. The profitability
of Devon’s operations in the Deep Basin is enhanced by its
ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area. Deep Basin
reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids, producing up to
50 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf of gas.

Other important conventional oil and gas exploration and
development areas for Devon in Canada include the Peace River
Arch, Northeast British Columbia and the Central Plains. Devon
drilled 149, 115 and 90 wells, respectively, in these areas
in 2004.

Devon also drills for and produces “cold-flow” heavy
oil in the Lloydminster area of Alberta and Saskatchewan where
oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000
to 2,000 feet. Lloydminster accounted for 12% of
Devon’s 2004 Canadian proved reserves.

The oil sands of Eastern Alberta are a vast North American
hydrocarbon resource. Devon holds over 140,000 net acres of
oil sands leases in Alberta. In December 2004, Devon received
final regulatory approval to proceed with development of its
Jackfish oil sands project, in which Devon has a 100% working
interest. The project is expected to produce 35 MBbls per
day of thermal heavy oil when fully operational in 2008. Devon
expects to invest $195 million at Jackfish in 2005 for site
preparation, facilities construction and initial well drilling.
Devon also owns interests in the Surmont and Dover oil sands
projects which are among those expected to be divested in 2005.

International

In addition to its core properties in the United States and
Canada, Devon also looks outside North America for longer-term
reserve and production growth. At December 31, 2004, these
international areas accounted for 13% of Devon’s worldwide
proved reserves.

The most significant international producing property is the
ExxonMobil-operated Zafiro oil field on Block B, offshore
Equatorial Guinea in West Africa. During 2004, Devon’s
share of production from Zafiro averaged 47 MBbls per day.
Devon’s share of production from Zafiro is expected to be
reduced by about 20% in 2005. The expected reduction is the
result of field decline and a change in Devon’s share of
production under the terms of the production sharing contract.

Devon will continue drilling development wells on Block B
in 2005. Devon has also identified exploratory prospects on
Block B and on three additional blocks in Equatorial Guinea
in which it has interests. Exploratory wells on Blocks B
and P are planned for 2005.



Devon also has active offshore exploration programs in other
countries in West Africa and Brazil. Devon made a discovery in
2004 offshore Brazil on Block BM-C-8 and plans follow-up
drilling in 2005. Devon also plans to drill potentially
high-impact exploratory wells offshore Nigeria and Angola in
2005.

Devon’s second most significant international producing
asset is its Panyu project offshore China. Panyu, in the Pearl
River Mouth of the South China Sea, was discovered in 1998.
Panyu production began late in 2003. Field production peaked in
2004 and averaged about 19 MBbls per day to Devon’s
interest during the year. Devon plans to drill and complete up
to 10 additional development wells and test two or three
exploratory prospects in the area during 2005. Devon expects its
net production from Panyu to average about 15 MBbls per day
in 2005.

In Azerbaijan, Devon has a 5.6% carried working interest in the
Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli, or ACG, oil development project in the
Caspian Sea. Devon estimates that the ACG field contains over
4.7 billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves. Oil
production from the ACG field will increase dramatically upon
completion of the Baku-T’Bilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which is
expected in 2005. Devon’s net share of ACG production is
expected to peak between 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day
in 2008 or 2009.

Devon also holds interests in Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana,
Egypt, Russia, Indonesia and Syria. In 2004, Devon entered into
several joint ventures with partners to test Devon’s
exploratory acreage in Egypt.

Title to Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. Devon
believes that such burdens do not materially detract from the
value of such properties or from the respective interests
therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
of the business.

As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
of local records, little investigation of record title is made
at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside
counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of
producing properties and before commencement of drilling
operations on undeveloped properties.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Royalty Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
and related parties used below-market prices, improper
deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and
sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The
principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is

United States
ex rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al.

(the “

Wright

case”). The suit was originally
filed in August 1996 in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000
with the other suits for pre-trial proceedings in the United
States District Court for the District of Wyoming. On
July 10, 2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the

Wright

case back to the Eastern District of Texas to
resume proceedings. Trial is set for February 2007 if the suit
continues to advance. Devon believes that it has acted
reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all
allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties in good faith.
Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material
exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has
been recorded in connection therewith.

Devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation
filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post
production costs from royalties payable by Devon. A significant
portion of such production is, or will be, transported through
facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of which
Devon owns a 75% interest. Devon believes that it has acted
reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in accordance
with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and applicable
law, and Devon does not believe that it is subject to material
exposure in association with this litigation.



Tax Treatment of Exchangeable Debentures

As described more fully in Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report, Devon
has certain exchangeable debentures, with a principal amount
totaling $760 million, which are exchangeable at the option
of the holders into shares of ChevronTexaco common stock owned
by Devon. The debentures were assumed, and the ChevronTexaco
common stock was acquired, by Devon in the 1999 PennzEnergy
merger.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) recently examined
the 1998 income tax return of PennzEnergy’s predecessor,
and the IRS formally notified Devon in April 2004 that it
disagreed with certain tax treatments of the exchangeable
debentures and similar exchangeable debentures retired in 1998.
Devon did not agree with the IRS positions and contested the
claim of additional taxes. In June 2004, Devon formally
protested the IRS notice and requested a conference with the IRS
Appeals Office. A preliminary appeals conference was held in
October 2004, and additional appeals meetings were held in
November and December 2004. This matter was resolved in February
2005, when the IRS agreed with Devon and concluded that no taxes
were due.

Other Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge
as of the date of this report, there were no other material
pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which
any of its property is subject.

Market Price

Devon’s common stock has been traded on the New York Stock
Exchange (the “NYSE”) since October 12, 2004.
Prior to October 12, 2004, Devon’s common stock was
traded on the American Stock Exchange (the “AMEX”).
From December 15, 1998 to August 27, 2004, a class of
Devon exchangeable shares traded on The Toronto Stock Exchange
under the symbol “NSX”. These shares were essentially
equivalent to Devon common stock and were exchangeable at any
time, on a one-for-one basis, for common shares of Devon at the
holder’s option. The last remaining exchangeable shares
outstanding were exchanged for Devon common stock on
August  27, 2004.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for
Devon common stock as reported by the NYSE and AMEX for the
periods indicated.

On February 28, 2005, there were 18,623 holders of
record of Devon common stock.

Dividends

Devon commenced the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends
on its common stock on June 30, 1993, in the amount of
$0.015 per share. Effective December 31, 1996, Devon
increased its quarterly dividend payment to $0.025 per
share. Effective March 31, 2004, Devon increased its
quarterly dividend payment to $0.05 per share. Effective
March 31, 2005, Devon will increase the quarterly dividend
payment to $0.075 per share. Devon anticipates continuing
to pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future.

Devon acquired another entity via a merger in 2000 which was
    accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of
    accounting for business combinations. This accounting method
    required Devon to report the results of both companies as if
    they had always been combined. Therefore, the cash dividends per
    share presented for 2000 are not representative of the actual
    amounts paid by Devon on a historical basis. For the year 2000,
    Devon’s historical cash dividends per share were $0.10.

(2)

For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed
    charges and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and
    preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings
    before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges
    consist of interest expense, dividends on subsidiary’s
    preferred stock, distributions on preferred securities of
    subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness
    and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one-third
    of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and
    (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of
    pre-tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding
    preferred stock. For the year 2002, earnings were insufficient
    to cover fixed charges by $135 million. For the year 2002,
    earnings were insufficient to cover combined fixed charges and
    preferred stock dividends by $151 million.

Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas
    per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy
    content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily
    indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. NGL
    volumes are converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil. The
    respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are affected by market
    and other factors in addition to relative energy content.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis addresses changes in
Devon’s financial condition and results of operations
during the three-year period of 2002 through 2004. Reference is
made to “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.”

Overview

According to most key financial and operating measures, 2004 was
the best year in Devon’s history. We delivered record
production, earnings, earnings per share and cash flow from
operations. Additionally, our drilling program was very
successful.

We produced 251 million Boe in 2004, representing a 10%
increase over our 2003 production of 228 million Boe. The
largest contributor to this growth was the merger with Ocean in
April 2003. With four additional months of production in 2004,
the Ocean merger generated 21 million Boe of the
year-over-year growth. Additionally, production in China began
in the fourth quarter of 2003 and contributed seven million Boe
of 2004 growth. These increases were partially offset by a
decline in offshore Gulf of Mexico production due to the effects
of Hurricane Ivan and natural production declines on certain
other properties.

In 2004, we also delivered the highest net earnings,
$2.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share, $4.38, in our
16 years as a public company. With an increase in
production and increases in average realized commodity prices,
Devon’s oil, gas and NGL revenues climbed 27% to almost
$7.5 billion. Also contributing to the growth in earnings,
our marketing and midstream margin grew 26% to $362 million
in 2004 primarily due to higher realized prices for natural gas
and NGLs.

Record production and revenues were partially offset by higher
operating expenses in 2004. The primary factors driving the
increases in expenses were increased operations due to the Ocean
merger, increased well workover activity, the weakening of the
U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and increased
production taxes. The higher production taxes tracked our
increase in commodity revenues. Although most expenses
increased, general and administrative expenses decreased 10% as
a result of the realization of overhead and personnel
efficiencies following the Ocean merger.

In addition to generating record earnings in 2004, Devon also
delivered record cash flow from operations. At
$4.8 billion, our 2004 cash flow from operations represents
a 28% increase over 2003. This all-time high amount was used to
fund a $3.1 billion capital expenditure program,
$973 million of debt repayments, $189 million of
common stock repurchases and $107 million of dividend
payments. At December 31, 2004, we had $2.1 billion of
cash and short-term investments. This amount is adequate to
cover debt maturities through 2007.

Furthermore, on September 27, 2004, Devon announced two key
initiatives aimed at creating additional value for its
stockholders. First, we announced a property divestiture
program. The sales of non-core properties located in Canada, the
onshore U.S. and in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to generate
$1.0 to $1.5 billion in after-tax proceeds. Closings are
expected in the first half of 2005. Second, we announced a stock
repurchase program. With cash flow from operations and proceeds
from the planned sales of oil and gas properties, we intend to
repurchase up to 50 million shares of our common stock.
Through February 28, 2005, we had repurchased
12.5 million shares at a total cost of $501 million.



In 2004, we declared a two-for-one stock split and moved our
stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. At its March 2005
meeting, Devon’s Board of Directors approved the increase
of the quarterly cash dividends from $0.05 per share to
$0.075 per share. The increase is effective March 31,
2005.

Oil, gas and NGL prices and, therefore, oil, gas and NGL
revenues are influenced by many factors outside of our control.
Consequently, Devon’s management has focused its efforts on
increasing oil and gas reserves and production and controlling
costs. Devon’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent
on our ability to continue to contain our overall cost structure
at a level that will allow for profitable production. As a
result, Devon has established a foundation of core assets in
North America that can consistently deliver cost-efficient
drill-bit growth and provide a strong source of free cash flow.
We balance this foundation of core assets with measured
investment in high-impact projects in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico and international arenas.

During 2004, Devon drilled 274 exploration wells and over 1,900
development wells, and we incurred $2.9 billion in costs
related to oil and gas property acquisition, exploration, and
development activities. With an overall drilling success rate of
96%, reserves grew 268 million Boe from discoveries and
extensions. Another 45 million Boe of reserves were added
to Devon’s reserve base from performance revisions. These
2004 drilling results are evidence of our success in lowering
the costs of adding proved reserves.

At December 31, 2004, our proved reserves totaled
2.1 billion Boe. Although reserve additions due to
discoveries, extensions and performance revisions outpaced 2004
production, reserves at December 31, 2004 were relatively
flat compared to December 31, 2003. This resulted from
negative price revisions which reduced reserves by
76 million Boe.

To estimate reserves, accounting rules dictate that prices in
effect as of the last day of the period are held constant
indefinitely. As a result, two primary factors caused the
negative price revisions at December 31, 2004. First,
Devon’s reserves under certain international production
sharing contracts are based in part on the amount of revenue
needed to recover our costs. Therefore, as prices increase, as
was the case for Brent prices at December 31, 2004 compared
to December 31, 2003, our international reserves associated
with production sharing contracts decrease. Second, heavy oil
differentials in Canada widened to over 54% of the NYMEX price
at December 31, 2004 compared to a historical average of
approximately 30%. Both circumstances were the primary causes of
the 2004 negative price revisions.

While Devon has consistently increased production over time,
volatility in oil, gas and NGL prices has resulted in
considerable variability in earnings and cash flows. Prices for
oil, gas and NGLs are determined primarily by market conditions.
Market conditions for these products have been, and will
continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide economic
activity, weather and other factors that are beyond our control.
Market conditions, among other factors, will continue to impact
Devon’s future earnings and cash flows.

Like all oil and gas exploration and production companies, Devon
faces the challenge of natural production decline. As virgin
reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and natural gas production
from a given well naturally decreases. Thus, an oil and gas
exploration and production company depletes part of its asset
base with each unit of oil or gas it produces. Historically, we
have been able to overcome this natural decline by adding,
through drilling and acquisitions, more reserves than we
produce. Devon’s future growth will depend on our ability
to continue to add reserves in excess of production.

In summary, 2004 was a successful year for Devon and its
stockholders, and the outlook for 2005 is promising as well.
Devon’s base of core North American resources continues to
deliver strong production growth, high margins and attractive
returns. Our exploration weighted activities in the Gulf of
Mexico and in our international division will expose
stockholders to meaningful value creation opportunities.
Devon’s financial position provides the flexibility to
simultaneously invest in exploration and development projects,
retire debt, repurchase stock and, as was recently approved,
increase cash dividends in 2005.



Results of Operations

Oil Revenues

2004 vs. 2003

Oil revenues increased $614 million in
2004. An increase in 2004 production of 16 million barrels
caused oil revenues to increase by $415 million. The April
2003 Ocean merger accounted for 14 million barrels of
increased production. The remaining increase is primarily
related to new production from China partially offset by natural
production declines and the effects of Hurricane Ivan on
Devon’s domestic properties. Oil revenues increased
$199 million due to a $2.55 increase in the average
realized price of oil.

2003 vs. 2002

Oil revenues increased $679 million in
2003. An increase in 2003 production of 20 million barrels
caused oil revenues to increase by $436 million. The April
2003 Ocean merger accounted for 25 million barrels of
increased production, partially offset by production lost from
the 2002 property divestitures of 5 million barrels. Oil
revenues increased $243 million due to a $3.92 increase in
the average price of oil.

Gas Revenues

2004 vs. 2003

Gas revenues increased $835 million in
2004. A $0.81 per Mcf increase in the average gas price
caused revenues to increase by $714 million. An increase in
2004 production of 28 Bcf caused gas revenues to increase
by $121 million. The April 2003 Ocean merger accounted for
43 Bcf of increased production. This was offset by a
production decrease in Devon’s domestic properties as a
result of natural declines and the effects of Hurricane Ivan.

2003 vs. 2002

Gas revenues increased $1.8 billion in
2003. A $1.71 per Mcf increase in the average gas price
caused revenues to increase by $1.5 billion. An increase in
2003 production of 102 Bcf caused gas revenues to increase
by $287 million. The April 2003 Ocean merger and January
2002 Mitchell merger accounted for 113 Bcf and 11 Bcf
of increased production, respectively, partially offset by
production lost from the 2002 property divestitures of
36 Bcf. The remaining production increase was primarily
related to new drilling and development in the Barnett Shale
properties.

NGL Revenues

2004 vs. 2003

NGL revenues increased $147 million in
2004. A $4.39 per barrel increase in average NGL prices
caused revenues to increase by $106 million. An increase in
2004 production of 2 million barrels caused revenues to
increase $41 million. The April 2003 Ocean merger accounted
for 0.6 million barrels of increased production. The
remaining production increase was primarily related to new
drilling and development in the Barnett Shale properties.

2003 vs. 2002

NGL revenues increased $132 million in
2003. A $4.60 per barrel increase in average NGL prices
caused revenues to increase by $100 million. An increase in
2003 production of 3 million barrels caused revenues to
increase $32 million. The April 2003 Ocean merger and
January 2002 Mitchell merger each accounted for 1 million
barrels of increased production, partially offset by production
lost from the 2002 property divestitures of 1 million
barrels. The remaining production increase was primarily related
to new drilling and development in the Barnett Shale properties.



Marketing and Midstream Revenues

2004 vs. 2003

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
$241 million in 2004. Of this increase, approximately
$218 million was the result of higher overall market prices
for natural gas and NGLs. Additionally, revenues increased
$103 million due to higher third-party natural gas and NGL
throughput volumes. This was partially offset by
$80 million in lower revenues resulting primarily from the
sale of certain assets in 2004.

2003 vs. 2002

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
$461 million in 2003. Of this increase, approximately
$439 million was the result of higher overall market prices
for natural gas and NGLs. Additionally, revenues increased
$22 million due to higher third-party natural gas and NGL
throughput volumes. The increase in volumes was primarily
related to new drilling and development in the Barnett Shale
properties and an additional 24 days of production in 2003
due to the timing of the January 2002 Mitchell merger, partially
offset by volumes lost as a result of processing plant
dispositions.

Oil, Gas and NGL Production and Operating Expenses

2004 vs. 2003

Lease
operating expenses increased $202 million in 2004. The
April 2003 Ocean merger accounted for $84 million of the
increase. Lease operating expenses on our historical properties
increased $88 million, due to an increase in well workover
expenses, ad valorem taxes and power, fuel, casualty insurance
and repairs and maintenance costs. Additionally, changes in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate resulted in a
$30 million increase in costs.

The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe is primarily
related to increased well workover expenses, ad valorem taxes
and power, fuel and repairs and maintenance costs, as well as
the changes in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate.
With the increase in oil, gas and NGL prices, more well
workovers and repairs and maintenance costs are performed to
either maintain or improve production volumes. The higher prices
also resulted in increased power and fuel costs.

Production taxes increased $51 million in 2004. The
majority of Devon’s production taxes are assessed on our
onshore domestic properties. In the U.S., most of the production
taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues. Therefore,
the 22% increase in domestic oil, gas and NGL revenues was the
primary cause of the production tax increase.

2003 vs. 2002

Lease
operating expenses increased $303 million in 2003. The
April 2003 Ocean merger accounted for $199 million of the
increase. Lease operating expenses on our historical properties
increased $120 million, due to an increase in well workover
expenses and power, fuel, casualty insurance and repairs and
maintenance costs. Additionally, changes in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate resulted in a
$44 million increase in costs. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease of $60 million due to
property divestitures in 2002.

The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe is primarily
related to increased well workover expenses and power, fuel and
repairs and maintenance costs, as well as the changes in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. With the increase in
oil, gas and NGL prices, more well workovers and repairs and
maintenance costs are performed to either maintain or improve
production volumes. The higher prices also resulted in increased
power and fuel costs.

As stated previously, most U.S. production taxes are based
on a fixed percentage of revenues. Therefore, the 79% increase
in domestic oil, gas and NGL revenues was the primary cause of
the $93 million production tax increase.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas
    Properties (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated as the
percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the
year, multiplied by the net capitalized investment plus future
development costs in those reserves (the “depletable
base”). Generally, if reserve volumes are revised up or
down, then the DD&A rate per unit of production will change
inversely. However, if the depletable base changes, then the
DD&A rate moves in the same direction. The per unit DD&A
rate is not affected by production volumes. Absolute or total
DD&A, as opposed to the rate per unit of production,
generally moves in the same direction as production volumes. Oil
and gas property DD&A is calculated separately on a
country-by-country basis.

2004 vs. 2003

Oil and gas property related DD&A
increased $473 million in 2004. An increase in the combined
U.S., Canadian and international DD&A rate from
$7.33 per BOE in 2003 to $8.54 per BOE in 2004 caused
oil and gas property related DD&A to increase by
$305 million. The increase in the DD&A rate is
primarily related to the April 2003 Ocean merger, negative
reserve revisions in Canada and certain international countries
subject to production sharing contracts and changes in the
Canadian-to-



U.S. dollar exchange rate. A 10% increase in 2004 oil, gas
and NGL production caused DD&A to increase $168 million.

2003 vs. 2002

Oil and gas
property related DD&A increased $562 million in 2003.
An increase in the combined U.S., Canadian and international
DD&A rate from $5.88 per BOE in 2002 to $7.33 per
BOE in 2003 caused oil and gas property related DD&A to
increase by $331 million. The increase in the DD&A rate
is primarily related to the April 2003 Ocean merger, higher
finding and development costs and changes in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. A 21% increase in
2003 oil, gas and NGL production caused DD&A to increase
$231 million.

Accretion of Asset Retirement Obligation

Effective January 1, 2003, Devon adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(“SFAS No. 143”) using a cumulative
effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset
retirement obligations, asset retirement costs and accumulated
depreciation. SFAS No. 143 requires liability
recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets, such as producing well sites, offshore
production platforms, and natural gas processing plants. The
obligations included within the scope of SFAS No. 143
are those for which a company faces a legal obligation. The
initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to
record a separate liability at its fair value with an offsetting
asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the related
property and equipment on the balance sheet. The asset
retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational
method similar to that used for the associated property and
equipment.

Because the asset retirement obligation is recorded at its
discounted present value, Devon now records accretion expense to
reflect the increase in the asset retirement obligation due to
the passage of time. We recorded $44 million and
$36 million of such accretion expense during 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Marketing and Midstream Operating Costs and Expenses

2004 vs. 2003

Marketing and midstream operating costs and
expenses increased $165 million in 2004. Of this increase,
approximately $133 million was the result of an increase in
prices paid for gas and NGLs. Additionally, operating costs and
expenses increased $106 million due to higher third-party
natural gas and NGL throughput volumes. This was partially
offset by $74 million in lower costs and expenses resulting
primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004.

2003 vs. 2002

Marketing and midstream operating costs and
expenses increased $366 million in 2003. Of this increase,
approximately $347 million was the result of an increase in
prices paid for gas and NGLs. An increase in third-party
processed NGL volumes caused the remaining increase in 2003
costs and expenses. The increase in volumes was primarily
related to new drilling and development in the Barnett Shale
properties and an additional 24 days of production in 2003
due to the timing of the January 2002 Mitchell merger, partially
offset by volumes lost as a result of processing plant
dispositions.

General and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Devon’s net G&A consists of three primary components.
The largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses
incurred for personnel costs, office expenses, professional fees
and other G&A items. The gross amount of these expenses is
partially reduced by two offsetting components. One is the
amount of G&A capitalized pursuant to the full cost method
of accounting related to exploration and development activities.
The other is the amount of G&A reimbursed by working
interest owners of properties for which Devon serves as the
operator. These reimbursements are received during both the
drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. The
gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts capitalized
and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the consolidated
statements of operations. Net G&A includes



expenses related to oil, gas and NGL exploration and production
activities, as well as marketing and midstream activities. See
the following table for a summary of G&A expenses by
component.

2004 vs. 2003

Gross G&A increased $25 million.
The April 2003 Ocean merger increased gross expenses
$27 million primarily due to the inclusion of an additional
four months of Ocean activities in 2004 compared to 2003. Also,
higher compensation and benefit costs, increased charitable
contributions and the abandonment of certain Canadian office
space increased gross G&A $26 million, $12 million
and $5 million, respectively. During 2004, Devon also
incurred $6 million of incremental professional fees
related to additional activities performed to comply with the
requirements of Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002. Finally, changes in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar
exchange rate resulted in a $8 million increase in costs.
These increases were partially offset by the synergies obtained
from the Ocean merger.

The increase in both capitalized G&A of $32 million and
reimbursed G&A of $23 million was primarily related to
the increased activity subsequent to the April 2003 Ocean merger.

2003 vs. 2002

Gross G&A increased $137 million.
This increase was primarily related to the increased activities
resulting from the April 2003 Ocean merger, which added
$92 million of costs, and increased compensation and
benefit costs. Included in the increase of compensation and
benefit costs is $14 million related to an increase in
pension related costs.

The increase in capitalized G&A of $43 million was
primarily related to the April 2003 Ocean merger. Reimbursed
G&A increased $6 million. The increase in reimbursed
amounts was primarily related to the April 2003 Ocean merger,
partially offset by a decline in reimbursements related to the
2002 property divestitures.

Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
limitation is the discounted estimated after-tax future net
revenues from proved oil and gas properties, excluding future
cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement
obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas
properties, plus the cost of properties not subject to
amortization. The ceiling test is imposed separately by country.

In calculating future net revenues, current prices and costs
used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly
period. These prices are not changed except where different
prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for
the remaining term of those contracts. Devon has entered into
various derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash
flow hedges. These instruments, which consist of price swaps and
costless price collars, and the related future production
volumes, are discussed in Note 12. The effect of these
hedges has been considered in calculating the full cost ceiling
limitations as of December 31, 2004. These hedges reduced
the full cost ceiling limitations for the United States, Canada
and Equatorial Guinea as of the end of 2004 by
$102 million, $77 million and $76 million,
respectively. However, the 2004 capitalized costs in these
countries did not exceed the related ceiling limitations, with
or without the effects of the hedges.



The calculation also dictates the use of a 10% discount factor.
The costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a
quarterly basis. If the costs to be recovered exceed the
ceiling, the excess is written off as an expense, except as
discussed in the following paragraph.

If, subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the
applicable financial statements being published, prices increase
to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be
recovered, a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the
quarter is not required to be recorded. A writedown indicated at
the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of
additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the
quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements
would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered,
as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter.

Under the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations, acquired oil and gas properties are recorded at
estimated fair value as of the date of purchase. We estimate
such fair value using our estimates of future oil, gas and NGL
prices. In contrast, the ceiling calculation dictates that
prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter
are held constant indefinitely. Accordingly, the resulting value
from the ceiling calculation is not necessarily indicative of
the fair value of the reserves.

An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a
subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have
increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

During 2003 and 2002, we reduced the carrying value of our oil
and gas properties by $68 million and $651 million,
respectively, due to the full cost ceiling limitations. The
after-tax effects of these reductions in 2003 and 2002 were
$36 million and $371 million, respectively. The
following table summarizes these reductions by geographic area.

The 2003 reduction in carrying value was related to properties
in Egypt, Russia and Indonesia. The Egyptian reduction was
primarily due to poor results of a development well that was
unsuccessful in the primary objective. Partially as a result of
this well, Devon revised Egyptian proved reserves downward. The
Russian reduction was primarily the result of additional capital
costs incurred as well as an increase in operating costs. The
Indonesian reduction was primarily related to an increase in
operating costs and a reduction in proved reserves. As a result,
our Egyptian, Russian and Indonesian costs to be recovered
exceeded the related ceiling value by $26 million,
$9 million and $1 million, respectively. These
after-tax amounts resulted in pre-tax reductions of the carrying
values of our Egyptian, Russian and Indonesian oil and gas
properties of $45 million, $19 million and
$4 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Additionally, during 2003, we elected to discontinue certain
exploratory activities in Ghana, certain properties in Brazil
and other smaller concessions. After meeting the drilling and
capital commitments on these properties, we determined that
these properties did not meet our internal criteria to justify
further investment. Accordingly, we recorded a $43 million
charge associated with the impairment of these properties. The
after-tax effect of this reduction was $38 million.

The 2002 Canadian reduction was primarily the result of lower
prices. The recorded fair values of oil and gas properties added
from the Anderson acquisition in 2001 were based on expected
future oil and gas prices. These expected prices were higher
than the June 30, 2002 prices used to calculate the
Canadian ceiling.



Based on oil, natural gas and NGL cash market prices as of
June 30, 2002, Devon’s Canadian costs to be recovered
exceeded the related ceiling value by $371 million. This
after-tax amount resulted in a pre-tax reduction of the carrying
value of our Canadian oil and gas properties of
$651 million in the second quarter of 2002. This reduction
was the result of a sharp drop in Canadian gas prices during the
last half of June 2002. The end of June reference prices used in
the Canadian ceiling calculation, expressed in Canadian dollars
based on an exchange ratio of $0.6585, were a NYMEX price of
C$40.79 per barrel of oil and an AECO price of
C$2.17 per MMBtu. The cash market prices of natural gas
increased during the month of July 2002 prior to Devon’s
release of our second quarter results. However, this increase
was not sufficient to offset the entire reduction calculated as
of June 30.

Other Income (Expenses)

The details of the changes in other income
(expenses) between 2002 and 2004 are shown in the table
below.

A discussion of the significant other income
(expense) items follows.

Interest Expense

2004 vs. 2003

The average debt balance outstanding
decreased from $8.9 billion in 2003 to $8.5 billion in
2004 causing interest expense to decrease $21 million. The
decrease in average debt outstanding was due to debt repayments
during 2004. The average interest rate on outstanding debt was
approximately 6.0% in both periods. However, a slightly higher
rate in 2004 caused interest expense to increase $3 million.

Other items included in interest expense that are not related to
the debt balance outstanding were $9 million lower in 2004.
Of this decrease, $20 million related to the capitalization
of interest. The increase in interest capitalized was primarily
related to additional unproved properties acquired from the
April 2003 Ocean merger and the nature of the properties
acquired. The Ocean properties included significant deepwater
Gulf and international exploratory properties and major
development projects. The effect of the $20 million
increase in capitalized interest was partially offset by
$16 million of debt issuance costs expensed in 2004. The
$16 million related to the early repayment of the
outstanding balance under the $3 billion term loan credit
facility in the second quarter of 2004.



2003 vs. 2002

The average debt balance outstanding
increased from $8.3 billion in 2002 to $8.9 billion in
2003 causing interest expense to increase $32 million. The
increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily
to the debt assumed as a result of the April 2003 Ocean merger.
The average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.0% in both
periods.

Other items included in interest expense that are not related to
the debt balance outstanding were $63 million lower in
2003. Of this decrease, $46 million related to the
capitalization of interest, $10 million related to lower
net accretion and $8 million related to the loss on the
early extinguishment of the 8.75% senior notes in 2002. The
increase in interest capitalized was primarily related to
additional unproved properties acquired from the April 2003
Ocean merger.

Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Our Canadian subsidiary which has designated the Canadian dollar
as its functional currency has certain fixed-rate senior notes
which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian
dollar while the notes are outstanding increase or decrease the
expected amount of Canadian dollars eventually required to repay
the notes. In addition, Devon’s Canadian subsidiary has
cash and other working capital amounts denominated in
U.S. dollars which also fluctuate in value with changes in
the exchange rate. Such changes in the Canadian dollar
equivalent balance of the debt and working capital are required
to be included in determining net earnings for the period in
which the exchange rate changes. The increase in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate from $0.7738 at
December 31, 2003 to $0.8308 at December 31, 2004
resulted in a $22 million gain. The increase in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate from $0.6331 at
December 31, 2002 to $0.7738 at December 31, 2003
resulted in a $69 million gain. The increase in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate from $0.6279 at
December 31, 2001 to $0.6331 at December 31, 2002
resulted in a $1 million gain.

Impairment of ChevronTexaco Corporation Common Stock in

In the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon recorded a
$205 million other-than-temporary impairment of our
investment in 14.2 million shares of ChevronTexaco common
stock. We acquired these shares in the August 1999 acquisition
of PennzEnergy Company. The shares are deposited with an
exchange agent for possible exchange for $760 million of
debentures that are exchangeable into the ChevronTexaco shares.
The debentures, which mature in August 2008, were also assumed
by Devon in the 1999 PennzEnergy acquisition.

At the closing date of the PennzEnergy acquisition, we initially
recorded the ChevronTexaco common shares at their fair value,
which was $47.69 per share, or an aggregate value of
$677 million. Since then, as the ChevronTexaco shares have
fluctuated in market value, the value of the shares on
Devon’s balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable
market value. Through September 30, 2002, any decreases in
the value of the ChevronTexaco common shares were determined by
Devon to be temporary in nature. Therefore, the changes in value
were recorded directly to stockholders’ equity and were not
recorded in our results of operations through September 30,
2002.

The determination that a decline in value of the ChevronTexaco
shares is temporary or other than temporary is subjective and
influenced by many factors. Among these factors are the
significance of the decline as a percentage of the original cost
and the length of time the stock price has been below original
cost. Other factors are the performance of the stock price in
relation to the stock price of its competitors within the
industry and the market in general, and whether the decline is
attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting
ChevronTexaco.

Beginning in July 2002, the market value of ChevronTexaco common
stock began a significant decline. The price per share decreased
from $44.25 at June 30, 2002, to $34.63 per share at
September 30, 2002, and to $33.24 per share at
December 31, 2002. The year-end price of $33.24 represented
a 25% decline since June 30, 2002, and a 30% decline from
the original valuation in August 1999. As a result of the
decline in value during the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon
determined that the decline was other than temporary, as that
term is defined by accounting rules. Therefore, the
$205 million cumulative decrease in



the value of the ChevronTexaco common shares from the initial
acquisition in August 1999 to December 31, 2002, was
recorded as a noncash charge to Devon’s results of
operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net of the applicable
tax benefit, the charge reduced our net earnings by
$128 million.

The share price of ChevronTexaco common stock has increased to
$43.19 at December 31, 2003 and $52.51 at December 31,
2004. As a result, the market value of Devon’s investment
in ChevronTexaco common stock increased $273 million from
December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2004. The changes in
the value of the shares since December 31, 2002, net of
applicable taxes, have been recorded directly to
stockholders’ equity. However, depending on the future
performance of ChevronTexaco’s common stock, Devon may be
required to record additional noncash charges in future periods
if the value of such stock declines, and we determine that such
declines are other than temporary

Other Income

2004 vs. 2003

Other income increased $66 million in
2004. Other income increased $37 million due to gains
resulting from sales of certain non-oil and gas properties in
2004. Interest and dividend income increased $12 million in
2004 due to an increase in cash and short-term investment
balances.

Income Taxes

2004 vs. 2003

Devon’s 2004 effective financial tax
rate attributable to continuing operations was an expense of 34%
compared to an expense of 23% in 2003. Both the 2004 and 2003
rates benefited from Canadian statutory rate reductions. These
rate reductions resulted in a $36 million and
$218 million benefit being recorded in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, related to the lower tax rates being applied to
deferred tax liabilities outstanding as of the beginning of the
year. Excluding the effects of the Canadian rate reductions in
2004 and 2003 and the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas
properties in 2003, the effective financial tax expense rates
were 35% and 33% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 rate
was equal to the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the
effect of state income taxes offset by the tax benefits of
certain foreign deductions. The 2003 rate was lower than the
statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits of
certain foreign deductions.

2003 vs. 2002

Devon’s 2003 effective financial tax
rate attributable to continuing operations was an expense of 23%
compared to a benefit of 144% in 2002. The 2003 rate benefited
from a statutory rate reduction enacted by the Canadian
government. Excluding the effects of the 2003 Canadian rate
reduction, the impairment of ChevronTexaco stock in 2002 and the
reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties in 2003
and 2002, the effective financial tax expense rates were 33% and
23% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. These rates in both years
were lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to
the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions.

Results of Discontinued Operations

On April 18, 2002, we sold our Indonesian operations to
PetroChina Company Limited for total cash consideration of
$250 million. On October 25, 2002, we sold our
Argentine operations to Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. for total cash
consideration of $90 million. On January 27, 2003, we
sold our Egyptian operations to IPR Transoil Corporation for
total cash consideration of $7 million.

As a result, we reclassified our Indonesian, Argentine and
Egyptian activities as discontinued operations. This
reclassification affects not only the 2002 presentation of
financial results, but also the presentation of all prior
periods’ results. Subsequent to the sale of our Egyptian
and Indonesian operations, we acquired new Egyptian and
Indonesian assets in the April 2003 Ocean merger. Amounts and
activities related to these new Egyptian and Indonesian
operations are included in Devon’s continuing operations in
both 2003 and 2004.



Following are the components of the net results of discontinued
operations for the year 2002.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted
SFAS No. 143 and recorded a cumulative-effect-type
adjustment for an increase to net earnings of $16 million
net of deferred taxes of $10 million.

In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 106 (“SAB No. 106”)
to provide guidance regarding the interaction of
SFAS No. 143 with the full cost method of accounting
for oil and gas properties. Specifically, SAB No. 106
clarifies the manner in which the full cost ceiling test and
DD&A should be calculated in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 143. We adopted SAB No. 106 in
the fourth quarter of 2004. However, this adoption did not
materially impact our full cost ceiling test calculation or
DD&A for 2004.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data”.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
flow”) continued to be a primary source of capital and
liquidity in 2004. Operating cash flow in 2004 was
$4.8 billion compared to $3.8 billion in 2003 and
$1.8 billion in 2002. The increases in operating cash flow
in 2004 and 2003 were primarily caused by the increases in
revenues, partially offset by increased expenses, as discussed

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion in
2004 compared to $2.8 billion in 2003 and $2.0 billion
in 2002. The increases in cash used in investing activities were
directly related to increased capital expenditures net of
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, as well as
increases in short-term investment balances of $626 million
and $341 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.



Capital expenditures in 2004 were $3.1 billion. This total
includes $3.0 billion for the acquisition, drilling or
development of oil and gas properties. These amounts compare to
capital expenditures of $2.6 billion in 2003 and
$3.4 billion in 2002. The 2003 amount included
$2.5 billion for the acquisition, drilling or development
of oil and gas properties. The 2002 amount included
$1.7 billion related to the January 2002 Mitchell merger
and $1.6 billion for other acquisitions and the drilling or
development of oil and gas properties.

The April 2003 Ocean merger did not affect 2003 capital
expenditures because the consideration given was Devon common
stock. This differs from the January 2002 Mitchell merger, in
which the consideration given was both Devon common stock and
cash. As a result, the Mitchell merger did have an impact on
capital expenditures paid in cash.

Proceeds from sales of property and equipment were
$95 million, $179 million and $1.4 billion in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2002 amount includes
proceeds from the sales of certain non-core oil and gas
properties which were used to pay down debt.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities during 2004 was
$1.0 billion compared to $414 million in 2003. The
increase in cash used in financing activities from 2003 to 2004
was directly related to increased debt repayments net of
borrowings. The increase was also related to increased common
stock dividends and the repurchase of common stock, partially
offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common
stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was
$401 million in 2002, consisting primarily of net proceeds
from borrowings of long-term debt.

During 2004, Devon retired $973 million of debt. This was
primarily related to the $211 million 6.75% notes due
February 15, 2004 and the $125 million
8.05% notes due June 15, 2004, and payment of the
remaining $635 million outstanding on the $3 billion
term loan credit facility. During 2003, principal payments on
long-term debt, net of proceeds from borrowings of long-term
debt, were $521 million. This net amount related to
long-term debt assumed in the April 2003 Ocean merger.

During 2002, Devon had net borrowings of $410 million.
These net borrowings were primarily related to the
$2 billion borrowed under the $3 billion term loan
credit facility to pay for the cash portion of the Mitchell
merger. This was partially offset primarily by the repayment of
$1.1 billion of this facility with proceeds from the 2002
property sales, the early retirement of the 8.75% notes due
June 15, 2007 and certain Canadian notes, and the
retirement of Devon’s outstanding borrowings under its
commercial paper and revolving credit facilities.

Devon’s common stock dividends were $97 million,
$39 million and $31 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. We also paid $10 million of preferred stock
dividends in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The increase in common stock
dividends from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to a 100%
increase in the quarterly dividend rate and the increased number
of shares outstanding. Effective with the first quarter 2004
dividend payment, Devon increased its quarterly dividend rate
from $0.025 per share to $0.05 per share. The increase
in shares outstanding was primarily related to the April 2003
Ocean merger.

In conjunction with the stock buyback program announced
September 27, 2004, Devon repurchased 5 million shares
at a total cost of $189 million during 2004.

Devon received $268 million, $155 million and
$32 million from shares issued for employee stock options
exercised during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Liquidity

At December 31, 2004, Devon’s unrestricted cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled
$2.1 billion. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, such balances
increased $846 million, $981 million and
$109 million, respectively.



Historically, Devon’s primary source of capital and
liquidity has been operating cash flow. Additionally, we
maintain a revolving line of credit and a commercial paper
program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating
cash flow. Other available sources of capital and liquidity
include the issuance of equity securities and long-term debt.
Over the next twelve months another major source of liquidity
will be proceeds from the sales of oil and gas properties as
announced September 27, 2004. After-tax sale proceeds from
the divestiture program are expected to range between
$1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. We expect the
combination of these sources of capital will be more than
adequate to fund future capital expenditures, the common stock
buyback program, and other contractual commitments as discussed
later in this section.

Operating Cash Flow

Devon’s operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables,
the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil, natural gas
and NGLs produced. Prices for these commodities are determined
primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and
worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially
variable factors influence market conditions for these products.
These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to
predict.

To mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas
prices, Devon has utilized price collars to set minimum and
maximum prices on a portion of its production. Additionally, we
have entered into various financial price swap contracts and
fixed-price physical delivery contracts to fix the price to be
received for a portion of future oil and natural gas production.
The table below provides the volumes associated with these
various arrangements as of December 31, 2004.

In addition to the above quantities, we have fixed-price
physical delivery contracts covering Canadian natural gas
production for the years 2007 through 2011 ranging from
8 Bcf to 14 Bcf per year. Also, Devon has a
fixed-price physical delivery contract covering 4 Bcf and
3 Bcf of International natural gas production in 2007 and
2008, respectively. From 2012 through 2016, we have Canadian
natural gas volumes subject to fixed-price contracts, but the
yearly volumes are less than 1 Bcf.

It is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts with
investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management as
competent and competitive market makers. Devon does not hold or
issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Credit Lines

Another source of liquidity is our $1.5 billion five-year,
syndicated, unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Senior
Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes
(i) a five-year revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum
amount of U.S. $500 million and (ii) a
$1 billion sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit,
including letters of credit under the Canadian subfacility.

The Senior Credit Facility matures on April 8, 2009, and
all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time
unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 8
anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of
the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
of the lenders. Devon has obtained lender approval to extend the
current maturity date of April 8, 2009 to April 8,
2010. This maturity date extension will be effective
April 8, 2005 provided Devon has not experienced a
“material adverse effect,” as defined in the Senior
Credit Facility agreement, at that date.



Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at our
election, bear interest at various fixed rate options for
periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally less
than the prime rate. Devon may also elect to borrow at the prime
rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides for an
annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable
quarterly in arrears.

As of December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility. The available capacity under the Senior
Credit Facility as of December 31, 2004, net of
$226 million of outstanding letters of credit, was
approximately $1.3 billion.

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial
covenant. This covenant requires Devon to maintain a ratio of
total funded debt to total capitalization of no more than 65%.
The credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt
and total capitalization that include adjustments to the
respective amounts reported in Devon’s consolidated
financial statements. Per the agreement, total funded debt
excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of
ChevronTexaco Corporation common stock. Also, total
capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial
writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or
goodwill impairments. As of December 31, 2004, Devon’s
ratio as calculated pursuant to this covenant was 33.0%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility is not
restricted under any “material adverse condition”
clauses. It is not uncommon for credit agreements to include
such clauses. These clauses can remove the obligation of the
banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on
the borrower’s financial condition, operations, properties
or business considered as a whole, the borrower’s ability
to make timely debt payments, or the enforceability of material
terms of the credit agreement. While our Senior Credit Facility
includes covenants that require Devon to report a condition or
event having a material adverse effect on Devon, the obligation
of the banks to fund the Senior Credit Facility is not
conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
program may not exceed $725 million. Also, any borrowings
under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
under the Senior Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven
to 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
365 days. We had no commercial paper debt outstanding at
December 31, 2004.

Debt Ratings

Devon receives debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in
the United States. In determining our debt rating, the agencies
consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
agencies.

Devon’s current debt ratings are BBB with a stable outlook
by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 with a stable outlook
by Moody’s and BBB with a stable outlook by Fitch. There
are no “rating triggers” in any of our contractual
obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should
our debt rating fall below a specified level. Certain of
Devon’s agreements related to its oil and natural gas
hedges do contain provisions that could require us to provide
cash collateral in situations where our liability under the
hedge is above a certain dollar threshold and where our debt
rating is below investment grade (BBB- or Baa3). However,
Devon’s liability under these agreements would only exceed
the threshold level in circumstances where the market prices for
oil or natural gas were rising. It is unlikely that our debt
rating would be subjected to downgrades to non-investment grade
levels during such a period of rising oil and natural gas prices.

Devon’s cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility
is predicated on its corporate debt rating. Therefore, even
though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled
maturities, it would adversely impact the interest rate on any
borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of
the Senior



Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the
fully-drawn borrowing costs for the Senior Credit Facility from
LIBOR plus 70 basis points to a new rate of LIBOR plus
87.5 basis points. A ratings downgrade could also adversely
impact our ability to economically access future debt markets.

As of December 31, 2004, we are not aware of any potential
ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.

Capital Expenditures

In February 2005, Devon announced its 2005 capital expenditures
budget. Our 2005 capital expenditures are expected to range from
$3.0 billion to $3.5 billion, representing the largest
planned use of capital resources for capital investment
activities. To a certain degree, the ultimate timing of these
capital expenditures is within our control. Therefore, if oil
and natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates, we
could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2005 capital
expenditures until later periods or accelerate capital
expenditures planned for periods beyond 2005 to achieve the
desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. Based
upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2005, we
anticipate that our capital resources will be more than adequate
to fund 2005 capital expenditures.

Common Stock Buyback Program

During 2004 Devon repurchased five million shares of its
common stock, and we intend to repurchase up to 45 million
additional shares in 2005 in conjunction with a stock buyback
program announced in September 2004. The shares will be
repurchased with operating cash flow and proceeds from the
planned sales of oil and gas properties announced on
September 27, 2004. The stock repurchase program may be
discontinued at any time.

Contractual Obligations

A summary of Devon’s contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2004, is provided in the following table.

Firm transportation agreements represent “ship or pay”
arrangements whereby we have committed to ship certain volumes
of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed transportation fee. We have
entered into these agreements to aid the movement of our gas
production to market. Devon has sufficient production to utilize
the majority of these transportation services.

Devon has two offshore platform spars that are being used in the
development of the Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of
Mexico. The operating leases are for 20-year terms and contain
various



options whereby we may purchase the lessors’ interests in
the spars. We have guaranteed that the spars will have residual
values at the end of the operating leases equal to at least 10%
of the fair value of the spars at the inception of the leases.
The total guaranteed value is $20 million in 2022. However,
such amount may be reduced under the terms of the lease
agreements.

We also have two floating, production, storage and offloading
facilities (“FPSO”) that are being leased under
operating lease arrangements. One FPSO is being used in the
Panyu project offshore China. The other is being used in the
Zafiro field offshore Equatorial Guinea. The China lease expires
in September 2009 and the Equatorial Guinea lease expires in
July 2009.

The above table does not include $226 million of letters of
credit that have been issued by commercial banks on Devon’s
behalf. These letters of credit, if funded, would become
borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Most of these
letters of credit have been granted by Devon’s financial
institutions to support our international and Canadian drilling
commitments. The $8.0 billion of long-term debt shown in
the table excludes $1 million of net discounts and a
$9 million fair value adjustment. Both of these items are
included in the December 31, 2004, book balance of the debt.

Pension Funding and Obligations

Devon’s pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis
over employees’ approximate service periods and is
generally calculated independent of funding decisions or
requirements. We recognized expense for our defined benefit
pension plans of $26 million, $35 million and
$16 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We
estimate that our pension expense will approximate
$26 million in 2005.

As compared to the “projected benefit obligation,”
Devon’s qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans
were underfunded by $132 million and $137 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in
the underfunded amount during 2004 was primarily caused by gains
on investments and $70 million of contributions made to the
plans by Devon. These were partially offset by increases in the
benefit obligations. A detailed reconciliation of the 2004
activity is included in Note 13 to the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Of the $132 million
underfunded status at the end of 2004, $109 million is
attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which
have no plan assets. However, we have established certain trusts
to fund the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans. As
of December 31, 2004, these trusts had investments with a
market value of $60 million. The value of these trusts is
included in noncurrent other assets in our accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

As compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation,”
our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by
$11 million at December 31, 2004. The accumulated
benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation
in that the former includes no assumption about future
compensation levels. Our current intentions are to provide
sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated
benefit obligation remains fully funded. The actual amount of
contributions required during this period will depend on
investment returns from the plan assets. Required contributions
also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during
the same period, particularly the discount rate used to
calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit
obligation. For 2005, Devon expects its contributions to the
plan to be less than $10 million.

The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
assumptions can result in different expense and liability
amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the
assumptions. Devon believes that the two most critical
assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed
discount rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
weighted average rate of return of 8.34% and 8.25% at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We developed
these expected long-term rate of return assumptions by
evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
well as long-term inflation assumptions. The expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of
investment types in such assets. The target investment
allocation for Devon’s plan assets is 50%



U.S. large cap equity securities; 15% U.S. small cap
equity securities, equally allocated between growth and value;
15% international equity securities, equally allocated between
growth and value; and 20% debt securities.

We believe that its long-term asset allocation on average will
approximate the targeted allocation. We regularly review our
actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance the
investments to the targeted allocation when considered
appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
assumption of 100 basis points (from 8.34% to 7.34%) would
increase the expected 2005 pension expense by approximately
$4 million.

Devon discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted
average rate of 5.74% at December 31, 2004, compared to
6.23% at December 31, 2003. The discount rate is determined
at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations
could be effectively settled. This rate is based on high-quality
bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk. We
consider high quality corporate bond yield indices, such as
Moody’s Aa, when selecting the discount rate.

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
25 basis points (from 5.74% to 5.49%) would increase our
pension liability at December 31, 2004, by approximately
$18 million, and increase estimated 2005 pension expense by
approximately $2 million.

At December 31, 2004, Devon had unrecognized actuarial
losses of $155 million. These losses will be recognized as
a component of pension expense in future years. We estimate that
approximately $9 million and $8 million of the
unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension
expense in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The $9 million
estimated to be recognized in 2005 is a component of the total
estimated 2005 pension expense of $26 million referred to
earlier in this discussion.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
various other factors related to the participants in
Devon’s defined benefit pension plans will impact future
pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with
certainty what these factors will be in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Full Cost Ceiling Calculations

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
subject to amortization. If Devon’s capitalized costs are
in excess of the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written
off as an expense. The ceiling limitation is imposed separately
for each country in which we have oil and gas properties.

The discounted present value of future net revenues for our
proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is a major component of
the ceiling calculation, and represents the component that
requires the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves
are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates
of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process
of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves requires
substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations,
particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers
may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the
same data. Certain of our reserve estimates are prepared by
outside petroleum consultants, while other reserve estimates are
prepared by Devon’s engineers. See Note 18 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior
estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
years, annual revisions



to our reserve estimates, which have been both increases and
decreases in individual years, have averaged approximately 2% of
the previous year’s estimate. However, there can be no
assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary
in the future. If future significant revisions are necessary
that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities, it could
result in a full cost property writedown. In addition to the
impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of
the ceiling, estimates of proved reserves are also a significant
component of the calculation of DD&A.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
judgment, the associated prices of oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves, and the applicable discount rate, that are used to
calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not
require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that prices
and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held
constant indefinitely. Therefore, the future net revenues
associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on
Devon’s assessment of future prices or costs. Rather, they
are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of
each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed. In
calculating the ceiling, we adjust the end-of-period price by
the effect of cash flow hedges in place. This adjustment
requires little judgment as the end-of-period price is adjusted
using the contract prices for our cash flow hedges.

The ceiling calculation also dictates that a 10% discount factor
is to be used to calculate the present value of net cash flows.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect
as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
indefinitely, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting
value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.
Oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical. On
any particular day at the end of a quarter, prices can be either
substantially higher or lower than Devon’s long-term price
forecast that is a barometer for true fair value. Therefore, oil
and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full
cost ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in
price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a
reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Devon enters into oil and gas derivative financial instruments
to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We have
also entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposures to
interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps mitigate
either the effects on interest expense for variable-rate debt
instruments, or the debt fair values for fixed-rate debt. We are
not involved in any speculative trading activities of
derivatives. All derivatives requiring balance sheet recognition
are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value.

A substantial portion of our derivatives consists of contracts
that hedge the price of future oil and natural gas production.
These derivative contracts are cash flow hedges that qualify for
hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, while fair values of such
hedging instruments must be estimated as of the end of each
reporting period, the changes in the fair values attributable to
the effective portion of these hedging instruments are not
included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, the
changes in fair value of the effective portion of these hedging
instruments, net of tax, are recorded directly to
stockholders’ equity until the hedged oil or natural gas
quantities are produced. The ineffective portion of these
hedging instruments is included in our consolidated results of
operations.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we designate our cash
flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative
contract is entered into or the date of a business combination
which includes cash flow hedge instruments. Additionally, we
document all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Devon also
assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of hedged items. If we fail to meet the requirements for
using hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value of
these hedging instruments would not be recorded directly to
equity but in the consolidated results of operations.



The estimates of the fair values of Devon’s commodity
derivative contracts require substantial judgment. For these
contracts, we obtain forward price and volatility data for all
major oil and gas trading points in North America from
independent third parties. These forward prices are compared to
the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements. The
resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the
lives of the hedge contracts are discounted using LIBOR and
money market futures rates for the first year and money market
futures and swap rates thereafter. In addition, we estimate the
option value of price floors and price caps using an option
pricing model. These pricing and discounting variables are
sensitive to the period of the contract and market volatility as
well as changes in forward prices, regional price differentials
and interest rates. Fair values of Devon’s other derivative
contracts require less judgment to estimate and are primarily
based on quotes from independent third parties such as
counterparties or brokers.

Quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal
impact on our liquidity, capital resources or results of
operations, as long as the derivative contracts qualify for
treatment as a hedge. However, settlements of derivative
contracts do have an impact on our liquidity and results of
operations. Generally, if actual market prices are higher than
the price of the derivative contracts, our net earnings and cash
flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that
would have occurred absent these instruments. The opposite is
also true. Additional information regarding the effects that
changes in market prices will have on our derivative financial
instruments, net earnings and cash flow from operations is
included in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk”.

Business Combinations

Devon has grown substantially during recent years through
acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies. Most of
these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting, and recent accounting pronouncements
require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using
the purchase method.

Under the purchase method, the acquiring company adds to its
balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired
company’s assets and liabilities. Any excess of the
purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and
intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
is assessed for impairment at least annually.

There are various assumptions made by Devon in determining the
fair values of an acquired company’s assets and
liabilities. The most significant assumptions, and the ones
requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair values
of the oil and gas properties acquired. To determine the fair
values of these properties, we prepare estimates of oil, natural
gas and NGL reserves. These estimates are based on work
performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants. The
judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described
earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling
calculation.

However, there are factors involved in estimating the fair
values of acquired oil, natural gas and NGL properties that
require more judgment than that involved in the full cost
ceiling calculation. As stated above, the full cost ceiling
calculation applies end-of-period price and cost information to
the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount. By contrast, the
fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must
be based on our estimates of future oil, natural gas and NGL
prices. Devon’s estimates of future prices are based on our
own analysis of pricing trends. These estimates are based on
current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide
supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts.
They are also based on industry data regarding natural gas
storage availability, drilling rig activity, changes in delivery
capacity, trends in regional pricing differentials and other
fundamental analysis. Forecasts of future prices from
independent third parties are noted when Devon makes its pricing
estimates.

We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve
quantities acquired, and estimate future operating and
development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net
revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues
are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the
time of the business combination based upon Devon’s cost of
capital.



Devon also applies these same general principles in arriving at
the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business
combination. These unproved properties generally represent the
value of probable and possible reserves. Because of their very
nature, probable and possible reserve estimates are more
imprecise than those of proved reserves. To compensate for the
inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the
discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves
are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate
risk-weighting factor in each particular instance. It is common
for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible
reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30% to 80% to
arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values.

Generally, in Devon’s business combinations, the
determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties
requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets
and liabilities. The acquired companies commonly have long-term
debt that Devon assumes in the acquisition, and this debt must
be recorded at the estimated fair value as if Devon had issued
such debt. However, significant judgment on our behalf is
usually not required in these situations due to the existence of
comparable market values of debt issued by peer companies.

Except for the 2002 Mitchell merger, Devon’s mergers and
acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were
predominantly in the area of exploration, development and
production activities related to oil and gas properties.
However, in addition to exploration, development and production
activities, Mitchell’s business also included substantial
marketing and midstream activities. Therefore, a portion of the
Mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of
Mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and
equipment. This consisted primarily of natural gas processing
plants and natural gas pipeline systems.

The Mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing
properties that were also acquired by Devon from Mitchell.
Therefore, certain of the assumptions regarding future
operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to
the value of the midstream assets. For example, future
quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural
gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to
value the proved and unproved gas producing properties. Future
expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were
also based on price cases consistent with those used to value
the oil and gas producing assets acquired from Mitchell. Based
on historical costs and known trends and commitments, we also
estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing
and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows.
These cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those
used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas
producing assets to arrive at our estimated fair value of the
marketing and midstream facilities and equipment.

In addition to the valuation methods described above, Devon
performs other quantitative analyses to support the indicated
value in any business combination. These analyses include
information related to comparable companies, comparable
transactions and premiums paid.

In a comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
independent exploration and production companies with comparable
financial and operating characteristics. Such characteristics
are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to
those of the party to the proposed business combination. These
comparable company multiples are compared to the proposed
business combination company multiples for reasonableness.

In a comparable transactions analysis, we review certain
acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and
production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages
announced recently. The comparable transaction multiples are
compared to the proposed business combination transaction
multiples for reasonableness.

In a premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected
independent exploration and production company transactions in
addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded
companies announced recently, to review the premiums paid to the
price of the target one day, one week and one month prior to



the announcement of the transaction. Devon uses this information
to determine the mean and median premiums paid and compares them
to the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness.

While these estimates of fair value for the various assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on Devon’s
liquidity or capital resources, they can have an effect on the
future results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair
value assigned to both the oil and gas properties and non-oil
and gas properties, the lower future net earnings will be as a
result of higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense. Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas
properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas
prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling
writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop
below Devon’s price forecast that was used to originally
determine fair value. A full cost ceiling writedown would have
no effect on liquidity or capital resources in that period.
However, it would adversely affect our future results of
operations. The full cost ceiling writedown is a noncash charge.
As discussed in the “Capital Resources and Liquidity”
section, in calculating our debt-to-capitalization ratio under
our credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to add
back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling
property impairments or goodwill impairments.

Our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many
estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair
value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business
combination. As previously disclosed in our discussion of the
full cost ceiling calculations, during the past five years,
Devon’s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have
averaged approximately 2%. As discussed in the preceding
paragraphs, there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve
quantity estimates that are involved in determining the fair
value of oil and gas properties acquired in a business
combination. The inter-relationship of these estimates makes it
impractical to provide additional quantitative analyses of the
effects of changes in these estimates.

Valuation of Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. This
requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and
liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above
for a business combination. Therefore, considerable judgment
similar to that described above in connection with estimating
the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination
is also required to assess goodwill for impairment.

Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil
and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower
goodwill would be. A lower goodwill value decreases the
likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes
in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the
likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill
impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital
resources. However, it would adversely affect Devon’s
results of operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
average changes in Devon’s reserve estimates previously set
forth.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
Adopted

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”,
(“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which is a revision of
SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25
regarding stock-based employee compensation plans. APB Opinion
No. 25 requires recognition of compensation expense only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
stock option exercise price on the date of grant. Additionally,
SFAS No. 123 established fair value-based accounting
for stock-based employee compensation plans but allowed pro
forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement
recognition. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to
be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Also, pro forma
disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based
payments is no longer an alternative. We will adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) in the third quarter of
2005 and anticipate adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using the
modified prospective



method. Under this method, we will recognize compensation
expense for all stock-based awards granted or modified on or
after July 1, 2005, as well as any previously granted
awards that are not fully vested as of July 1, 2005.
Compensation expense will be measured based on the fair value of
the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma
disclosures in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123. We are currently assessing the impact of
adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on our consolidated results
of operations. However, we do not expect such impact to be
material upon adoption in the third quarter of 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-2,
“Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP No. 109-2”). The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”), signed
into law on October 22, 2004, provides for a special
one-time tax deduction, or dividend received deduction
(“DRD”), of 85% of qualifying foreign earnings that
are repatriated in either a company’s last tax year that
began before the enactment date or the first tax year that
begins during the one-year period beginning on the enactment
date. FSP 109-2 provides entities additional time to assess the
effect of repatriating foreign earnings under the Act for
purposes of applying SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” which typically requires the effect of a
new tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment. In the
first quarter of 2005, Devon’s board of directors approved
the repatriation of $500 million of earnings from Canadian
operations which will be taxed at a reduced income tax rate
caused by the DRD. As a result, Devon will recognize in the
first quarter of 2005 approximately $30 million of
additional current income tax expense.

SEC Inquiry Relating to Equatorial Guinea

On August 6, 2004, the SEC notified Devon that it was
conducting an inquiry into payments made to the government of
Equatorial Guinea, or to officials and persons affiliated with
officials of the government of Equatorial Guinea. This inquiry
follows an investigation and public hearing conducted by the
United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments,
including that of Equatorial Guinea, with Riggs Bank. The
investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of those
U.S. oil companies having interests in Equatorial Guinea,
including Devon. Devon is cooperating with the SEC inquiry.

2005 Estimates

The forward-looking statements provided in this discussion are
based on management’s examination of historical operating
trends, the information which was used to prepare the
December 31, 2004 reserve reports and other data in our
possession or available from third parties. Devon cautions that
its future oil, natural gas and NGL production, revenues and
expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties
normally incident to the exploration for and development,
production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs. These risks include,
but are not limited to, price volatility, inflation or lack of
availability of goods and services, environmental risks,
drilling risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in
estimating future oil and gas production or reserves, and other
risks as outlined below.

Additionally, Devon cautions that its future marketing and
midstream revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks
and uncertainties normally incident to the marketing and
midstream business. These risks include, but are not limited to,
price volatility, environmental risks, regulatory changes, the
uncertainty inherent in estimating future processing volumes and
pipeline throughput, cost of goods and services and other risks
as outlined below.

Also, the financial results of our foreign operations are
subject to currency exchange rate risks. Additional risks are
discussed below in the context of line items most affected by
such risks.

Specific Assumptions and Risks Related to Price and
    Production Estimates

Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs are determined primarily by
prevailing market conditions. Market conditions for these
products are influenced by regional and worldwide economic
conditions, weather and other local market conditions. These
factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. In
addition to volatility in general, Devon’s oil, gas and NGL
prices may vary considerably due to



differences between regional markets, differing quality of oil
produced (i.e., sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude),
differing Btu contents of gas produced, transportation
availability and costs and demand for the various products
derived from oil, natural gas and NGLs. Substantially all of
Devon’s revenues are attributable to sales, processing and
transportation of these three commodities. Consequently, our
financial results and resources are highly influenced by price
volatility.

Estimates for Devon’s future production of oil, natural gas
and NGLs are based on the assumption that market demand and
prices will continue at levels that allow for profitable
production of these products. There can be no assurance of such
stability. Most of our Canadian production of oil, natural gas
and NGLs is subject to government royalties that fluctuate with
prices. Thus, price fluctuations can affect reported production.
Also, our international production is governed by payout
agreements with the governments of the countries in which we
operate. If the payout under these agreements is attained
earlier than projected, Devon’s net production and proved
reserves in such areas could be reduced.

Estimates for our future processing and transport of oil,
natural gas and NGLs are based on the assumption that market
demand and prices will continue at levels that allow for
profitable processing and transport of these products. There can
be no assurance of such stability.

The production, transportation, processing and marketing of oil,
natural gas and NGLs are complex processes which are subject to
disruption from many causes. These causes include transportation
and processing availability, mechanical failure, human error,
meteorological events including, but not limited to, hurricanes,
and numerous other factors. The following forward-looking
statements were prepared assuming demand, curtailment,
producibility and general market conditions for Devon’s
oil, natural gas and NGLs during 2005 will be substantially
similar to those of 2004, unless otherwise noted.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the following dollar amounts are
expressed in U.S. dollars. Amounts related to Canadian
operations have been converted to U.S. dollars using a
projected average 2005 exchange rate of $0.82 U.S. to
$1.00 Canadian. The actual 2005 exchange rate may vary
materially from this estimate. Such variations could have a
material effect on the following estimates.

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions and
dispositions in recent years, these transactions are opportunity
driven. Thus, the following forward-looking data excludes the
financial and operating effects of potential property
acquisitions or divestitures, except as discussed in
“Property Acquisitions and Divestitures,” during the
year 2005. The timing and ultimate results of such acquisition
and divestiture activity is difficult to predict, and may vary
materially from that discussed in this report.

Geographic Reporting Areas for 2005

The following estimates of production, average price
differentials and capital expenditures are provided separately
for each of the following geographic areas:

Year 2005 Potential Operating Items

The estimates related to oil, gas and NGL production, operating
costs and DD&A set forth in the following paragraphs are
based on estimates for Devon’s properties other than those
that have been designated for possible sale (See “Property
Acquisitions and Divestitures”). Therefore, the following
estimates exclude the results of the potential sale properties
for the entire year.

Oil, Gas and NGL Production

Set forth in the
following paragraphs are individual estimates of Devon’s
oil, gas and NGL production for 2005. On a combined basis, Devon
estimates its 2005 oil, gas



and NGL production will total 217 MMBoe. Of this total,
approximately 92% is estimated to be produced from reserves
classified as “proved” at December 31, 2004.

Oil Production

We expect our oil production in 2005 to
total 60 MMBbls. Of this total, approximately 95% is
estimated to be produced from reserves classified as
“proved” at December 31, 2004. The expected
production by area is as follows:

Oil Prices — Fixed

Through various price swaps,
Devon has fixed the price it will receive in 2005 on a portion
of its oil production. The following table includes information

are netted against the prices recorded by Devon.

Oil Prices — Floating

Devon’s 2005 average
prices for each of its areas are expected to differ from the
NYMEX price as set forth in the following table. The NYMEX price
is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil delivered at
Cushing, Oklahoma.

We have also entered into costless price collars that set a
floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 oil production
that is otherwise subject to floating prices. The floor and
ceiling prices related to domestic and Canadian oil production
are based on the NYMEX price. The floor and ceiling prices
related to international oil production are based on the Brent
price. If the NYMEX or Brent price is outside of the ranges set
by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon
and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference.
As long as Devon meets the ongoing requirements of hedge
accounting for its derivatives, any such settlements will either
increase or decrease Devon’s oil revenues for the period.
Because our oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ
from the NYMEX or Brent price due to differing quality (i.e.,
sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude) and transportation costs
from different geographic areas, the floor and ceiling prices of
the various collars do not reflect actual limits of Devon’s
realized prices for the production volumes related to the
collars.



The international oil prices shown in the following table have
been adjusted to a NYMEX-based price, using our estimates of
2005 differentials between NYMEX and the Brent price upon which
the collars are based.

To simplify the presentation, Devon’s costless collars as
of December 31, 2004, have been aggregated in the following
table according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling
prices. The floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages

We have also entered into costless price collars that set a

production that otherwise is subject to floating prices. If the
applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set
by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon
and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference.
Any such settlements will either increase or decrease
Devon’s gas revenues for the period. Because our gas
volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the



related regional indices, and due to differing Btu contents of
gas produced, the floor and ceiling prices of the various
collars do not reflect actual limits of our realized prices for
the production volumes related to the collars.

The prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a
NYMEX-based price, using our estimates of 2005 differentials
between NYMEX and the specific regional indices upon which the

collars are based on various regional first-of-the-month price
indices as published monthly by

Inside FERC.

Marketing and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Devon’s marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are
derived primarily from its natural gas processing plants and
natural gas transport pipelines. These revenues and expenses
vary in response to several factors. The factors include, but
are not limited to, changes in production from wells connected
to the pipelines and related processing plants, changes in the
absolute and relative prices of natural gas and NGL contract
provisions, and the amount of repair and workover activity
required to maintain anticipated transportation and processing
levels.

These factors, coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas
and NGL prices, increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
these uncertainties, we estimate that 2005 marketing and
midstream revenues will be between $1.26 billion and
$1.40 billion, and marketing and midstream expenses will be
between $1.00 billion and $1.10 billion.

Production and Operating Expenses

Devon’s
production and operating expenses include lease operating
expenses, transportation costs and production taxes. These
expenses vary in response to several factors. Among the most
significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from
Devon’s property base, changes in production tax rates,
changes in the general price level of services and materials
that are used in the operation of the properties and the amount
of repair and workover activity required. Oil, natural gas and
NGL prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and
impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that 2005 lease operating
expenses (including transportation costs) will be between
$1.155 billion and $1.225 billion and production taxes
will be between 3.25% and 3.75% of consolidated oil, natural gas
and NGL revenues. This excludes the effect on revenues from
hedges, upon which production taxes are not incurred.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
(“DD&A”)

The 2005 oil and gas property
DD&A rate will depend on various factors. Most notable among
such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be
added from drilling or acquisition efforts in 2005 compared to
the costs incurred for such efforts,



and the revisions to Devon’s year-end 2004 reserve
estimates that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made
during 2005.

Given these uncertainties, oil and gas property related DD&A
expense for 2005 is expected to be between $1.86 billion
and $1.94 billion. Based on these DD&A amounts and the
production estimates set forth earlier, we expect our oil and
gas property related DD&A rate will be between
$8.60 per Boe and $9.00 per Boe.

Additionally, we expect depreciation and amortization expense
related to non-oil and gas property fixed assets to total
between $150 million and $160 million.

Accretion of Asset Retirement Obligation

Devon
expects its 2005 accretion of its asset retirement obligation to
be between $40 million and $45 million.

General and Administrative Expenses
(“G&A”)

G&A includes the costs of many
different goods and services used in support of our business.
These goods and services are subject to general price level
increases or decreases. In addition, Devon’s G&A varies
with its level of activity and the related staffing needs as
well as with the amount of professional services required during
any given period. Should our needs or the prices of the required
goods and services differ significantly from current
expectations, actual G&A could vary materially from the
estimate.

The planned property dispositions have further added to the
uncertainties around G&A estimates. Devon is currently in
the process of determining the appropriate staffing needs
subsequent to the dispositions. Specifically excluded from these
estimates are both severance related costs and the cost savings
that would result from an expected reduction of headcount. Any
cost savings from these reductions will be dependent not only on
the level of staff reductions, but also on the timing. As a
result, until this process is complete, actual 2005 G&A
could vary materially from current estimates.

Given these limitations, consolidated G&A in 2005 is
expected to be between $260 million and $280 million.

Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas
Properties

We follow the full cost method of accounting
for our oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method,
Devon’s net book value of oil and gas properties, less
related deferred income taxes (the “costs to be
recovered”), may not exceed a calculated “full cost
ceiling.” The ceiling limitation is the discounted
estimated after-tax future net revenues from oil and gas
properties plus the cost of properties not subject to
amortization. The ceiling is imposed separately by country. In
calculating future net revenues, current prices and costs used
are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period.
These prices are not changed except where different prices are
fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the
remaining term of those contracts. Such contracts include
derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges. The costs to be
recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis. If
the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling, the excess is
written off as an expense. An expense recorded in one period may
not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil
and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the
subsequent period.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect
as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
indefinitely, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting
value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.
Oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and,
on any particular day at the end of a quarter, can be either
substantially higher or lower than our long-term price forecast
that is a barometer for true fair value. Therefore, oil and gas
property writedowns that result from applying the full cost
ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price
as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a
reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.

Because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not
possible to predict whether we will incur a full cost writedown
in future periods.

Interest Expense

Future interest rates and debt
outstanding have a significant effect on Devon’s interest
expense. Additionally, we can only marginally influence the
prices we will receive in 2005 from



sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the resulting cash flow.
These factors increase the margin of error inherent in
estimating future interest expense. Other factors which affect
interest expense, such as the amount and timing of capital
expenditures, are within our control.

The interest expense in 2005 related to our fixed-rate debt,
including net accretion of related discounts, will be
approximately $430 million. This fixed-rate debt removes
the uncertainty of future interest rates from some, but not all,
of Devon’s long-term debt. Our floating rate debt is
discussed in the following paragraphs.

We have various debt instruments which have been converted to
floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps. Our
floating rate debt is as follows:

(1)

Converted from $200 million Canadian dollars at a
    Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate of $0.8308 as of
    December 31, 2004.

Based on future LIBOR rates as of January 31, 2005,
interest expense on our floating rate debt, including net
amortization of premiums, is expected to total between
$75 million and $85 million in 2005.

Devon’s interest expense totals have historically included
payments of facility and agency fees, amortization of debt
issuance costs, the effect of interest rate swaps not accounted
for as hedges, and other miscellaneous items not related to the
debt balances outstanding. We expect between $5 million and
$15 million of such items to be included in our 2005
interest expense. Also, we expect to capitalize between
$65 million and $75 million of interest during 2005.

Based on the information related to interest expense set forth
herein and assuming no material changes in Devon’s levels
of indebtedness or prevailing interest rates, other than the
retirement of debt due to mature in 2005, we expect our 2005
interest expense will be between $445 million and
$455 million.

Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Rates

Our
Canadian subsidiary has $400 million of fixed-rate senior
notes which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian
dollar during 2005 will increase or decrease the Canadian dollar
equivalent balance of this debt. Such changes in the Canadian
dollar equivalent balance of the debt are required to be
included in determining net earnings for the period in which the
exchange rate changes. Because of the variability of the
exchange rate, it is difficult to estimate the effect which will
be recorded in 2005. However, based on the December 31,
2004, Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate of $0.8308 and
Devon’s forecast 2005 rate of $0.8200, we expect to record
an expense of approximately $5 million. The actual 2005
effect will depend on the exchange rate as of December 31,
2005.

Other Revenues

Devon’s other revenues in 2005
are expected to be between $260 million and
$270 million. Included as part of other revenues is a
$150 million gain on the sale of certain assets in the
first quarter of 2005.

Our estimate of 2005 other revenues does not include the effect
of any early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness of outstanding
commodity price hedges as a result of the property dispositions.
The amount of any settlement gain or loss or hedge
ineffectiveness will depend not only on the timing of the
property sales but also on the forward prices in effect at that
time. As a result, Devon is unable to predict the effect that
these early settlements or hedge ineffectiveness may have on its
earnings. Under current market conditions, we would expect to
record a loss on these early settlements or hedge
ineffectiveness.



Income Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2005
will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial
pre-tax earnings. The tax rate for 2005 will be significantly
affected by the proportional share of consolidated pre-tax
earnings generated by U.S., Canadian and International
operations due to the different tax rates of each country. There
are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed
impact on 2005’s income tax expense regardless of the level
of pre-tax earnings that are produced. Given the uncertainty of
our pre-tax earnings amount, we estimate that our consolidated
financial income tax rate in 2005 will be between 25% and 45%.
The current income tax rate is expected to be between 20% and
30%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to be between 5%
and 15%. Significant changes in estimated capital expenditures,
production levels of oil, gas and NGLs, the prices of such
products, marketing and midstream revenues, or any of the
various expense items could materially alter the effect of the
aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2005’s
financial income tax rates.

Property Acquisitions and Divestitures

Though
Devon has completed several major property acquisitions in
recent years, these transactions are opportunity driven. Thus,
we do not “budget,” nor can we reasonably predict, the
timing or size of such possible acquisitions, if any.

During 2005, we contemplate the disposition of certain oil and
gas properties (the “Disposition Properties”). The
Disposition Properties are predominantly properties that are
either outside of our core-operating areas or otherwise do not
fit our current strategic objectives. The Disposition Properties
are located in the U.S. and Canada. At this time, we expect the
dispositions will occur in the first half of 2005.

The estimates of our 2005 results previously set forth exclude
any results from the Disposition Properties. The Disposition
Properties’ actual contributions to our 2005 operating
results will depend upon the timing of the dispositions. The
estimated first quarter 2005 results from the Disposition
Properties (which are not included in the previous 2005
estimates in this report) are as follows:

Not included in these estimates is the effect of any early
settlements or hedge ineffectiveness of outstanding commodity
price hedges as a result of the dispositions. The amount of any
settlement gain or loss or hedge ineffectiveness will depend not
only on the timing of the property sales but also on the forward
prices in effect at that time. As a result, Devon is unable to
predict the effect that these early settlements or hedge
ineffectiveness may have on its earnings. Under current market
conditions, we would expect to record a loss on these early
settlements.

Year 2005 Potential Capital Sources, Uses and
    Liquidity

Capital Expenditures

Devon’s capital
expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil,
natural gas and NGL prices as well as the expected costs of the
capital additions. Should actual prices received differ
materially from Devon’s price expectations for its future
production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred and,
consequently, may increase or decrease total 2005 capital
expenditures. In



addition, if the actual material or labor costs of the budgeted
items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts, actual
capital expenditures could vary materially from our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed, we expect 2005 capital
expenditures for drilling and development efforts, plus related
facilities, to total between $2.6 billion and
$3.0 billion. These amounts include between
$390 million and $450 million for drilling and
facilities costs related to reserves classified as proved as of
year-end 2004. In addition, these amounts include between
$1.345 billion and $1.555 billion for other production
capital and between $865 million and $995 million for
exploration capital. Other production capital includes
development drilling that does not offset currently productive
units and for which there is not a certainty of continued
production from a known productive formation. Exploration
capital includes exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or
gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs.

The following table shows expected drilling and facilities
expenditures by geographic area.

In addition to the above expenditures for drilling and
development, Devon expects to spend between $85 million to
$95 million on its marketing and midstream assets, which
include its oil pipelines, gas processing plants, CO


removal facilities and gas transport pipelines. We also expect
to capitalize between $165 million and $175 million of
G&A expenses in accordance with the full cost method of
accounting and to capitalize between $65 million and
$75 million of interest. We also expect to pay between
$25 million and $30 million for plugging and
abandonment charges, and to spend between $70 million and
$80 million for other non-oil and gas property fixed assets.

Other Cash Uses

Devon’s management expects
the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to
continue. With the current $0.075 per share quarterly
dividend rate and 484 million shares of common stock
outstanding as of December 31, 2004, dividends are expected
to approximate $145 million. Also, Devon has
$150 million of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock upon which
it will pay $10 million of dividends in 2005.

On September 27, 2004, Devon announced its intention to buy
back up to 50 million shares of its common stock in
conjunction with a stock buyback program. The shares will be
repurchased with cash flow from operations and proceeds from the
planned property divestitures. As of February 28, 2005,
Devon has repurchased 12.5 million shares at a total cost
of $501 million, or $40.04 per share.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Devon’s
estimated 2005 cash uses, including its drilling and development
activities and repurchase of common stock, are expected to be
funded primarily through a combination of working capital,
operating cash flow and proceeds from its planned property
divestitures, with the remainder, if any, funded with borrowings
from our credit facility. The amount of operating cash flow to
be generated during 2005 is uncertain due to the factors
affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited. However, we
expect our combined capital resources to be more than adequate
to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses
for 2005. As of December 31, 2004, we had $2.1 billion
of cash and short-term investments and $1.3 billion
available under our $1.5 billion of credit facilities, net
of $0.2 billion of outstanding letters of credit. If
significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements
arise during the year, we could utilize our existing credit
facilities and/or seek to establish and utilize other sources of
financing.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
Devon’s potential exposure to market risks. The term
“market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. The disclosures are not meant
to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
information provides indicators of how Devon views and manages
its ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk
sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than
speculative trading.

Commodity Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian natural gas
and NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has
been volatile and unpredictable for several years.

Devon periodically enters into financial hedging activities with
respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas
production through various financial transactions which hedge
the future prices received. These transactions include financial
price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our
production and pay a variable market price to the contract
counterparty, and costless price collars that set a floor and
ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable
monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor
and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon and the
counterparty to the collars will settle the difference. These
financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and
natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage Devon’s
exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations.

Devon’s total hedged positions on future production as of
December 31, 2004 are set forth in the following tables.

Price Swaps

Through various price swaps, we have fixed the price we will
receive on a portion of our oil and natural gas production in
2005. The following tables include information on this
fixed-price production by area. Where necessary, the oil and gas
prices related to these swaps have been adjusted for certain
transportation costs that are netted against the price recorded
by Devon, and the gas price has also been adjusted for the Btu
content of the production that has been hedged.

Costless Price Collars

We have also entered into costless price collars that set a
floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 oil production
that is otherwise subject to floating prices. The floor and
ceiling prices related to



domestic and Canadian oil production are based on the NYMEX
price. The floor and ceiling prices related to international oil
production are based on the Brent price. If the NYMEX or Brent
price is outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling
prices in the various collars, Devon and the counterparty to the
collars will settle the difference. As long as Devon meets the
ongoing requirements of hedge accounting for its derivatives,
any such settlements will either increase or decrease
Devon’s oil revenues for the period. Because our oil
volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the NYMEX or
Brent price due to differing quality (i.e., sweet crude versus
heavy or sour crude) and transportation costs from different
geographic areas, the floor and ceiling prices of the various
collars do not reflect actual limits of Devon’s realized
prices for the production volumes related to the collars.

We have also entered into costless price collars that set a
floor and ceiling price for a portion of our 2005 natural gas
production that otherwise is subject to floating prices. If the
applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set
by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon
and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference.
Any such settlements will either increase or decrease
Devon’s gas revenues for the period. Because Devon’s
gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the
related regional indices, and due to differing Btu contents of
gas produced, the floor and ceiling prices of the various
collars do not reflect actual limits of Devon’s realized
prices for the production volumes related to the collars.

To simplify presentation, our costless collars as of
December 31, 2004 have been aggregated in the following
tables according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling
prices. The floor and ceiling prices shown are weighted averages
of the various collars in each aggregated group.

The international oil prices shown in the following table have
been adjusted to a NYMEX-based price, using our estimates of
2005 differentials between NYMEX and the Brent price upon which
the collars are based.

The natural gas prices shown in the following table have been
adjusted to a NYMEX-based price, using our estimates of future
differentials between NYMEX and the specific regional indices
upon which the collars are based. The floor and ceiling prices
related to the collars are based on various regional
first-of-the-month price indices as published monthly by

Inside FERC.

Devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the
hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and
gas may have on the fair value of its commodity hedging
instruments. At



December 31, 2004 a 10% increase in the underlying
commodities’ prices would have increased the net
liabilities recorded for our commodity hedging instruments by
$115 million.

Fixed-Price Physical Delivery Contracts

In addition to the commodity hedging instruments described
above, Devon also manages its exposure to oil and gas price
risks by periodically entering into fixed-price contracts.

We have fixed-price physical delivery contracts for the years
2005 through 2011 covering Canadian natural gas production
ranging from 8 Bcf to 14 Bcf per year. From 2012
through 2016, Devon also has Canadian gas volumes subject to
fixed-price contracts, but the yearly volumes are less than
1 Bcf.

We also have fixed-price physical delivery contracts for the
years 2005 through 2008 covering International natural gas
production of 4 Bcf per year, except in 2008 when the
volume drops to 3 Bcf.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2004, Devon had debt outstanding of
$8.0 billion. Of this amount, $6.0 billion, or 75%,
bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.0%. Devon also has a
floating-to-fixed interest rate swap in which we will record a
fixed rate of 6.4% on a notional amount of $104 million in
2005 and 2006 and 6.3% on a notional amount of $32 million
in 2007.

The remaining $1.8 billion of debt outstanding bears
interest at floating rates. Included in the floating-rate debt
is fixed-rate debt which has been converted to floating-rate
debt through interest rate swaps. The terms of Devon’s
Senior Credit Facility allow interest rates to be fixed at our
option for periods of between seven to 180 days. As of
December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding
under the Senior Credit Facility. Following is a table
summarizing the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with the
related debt instrument and notional amounts.

(1)

Converted from $200 million Canadian dollars at a
    Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate of $0.8308 as of
    December 31, 2004.

Devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the
hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on
the fair value of its interest rate swap instruments. At
December 31, 2004, a 10% increase in the underlying
interest rates would have decreased the fair value of
Devon’s interest rate swaps by $28 million.

The above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
because of the short-term maturity of such instruments.

Foreign Currency Risk

Devon’s net assets, net earnings and cash flows from its
Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar
equivalent of such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the
applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period.
Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using the
average exchange rate during the reporting period.



Our Canadian subsidiary, Devon Canada, has $400 million of
fixed-rate long-term debt that is denominated in
U.S. dollars. Changes in the currency conversion rate
between the Canadian and U.S. dollars between the beginning
and end of a reporting period increase or decrease the expected
amount of Canadian dollars required to repay the notes. The
amount of such increase or decrease is required to be included
in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange
rate changes. A 10% decrease in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar
exchange rate would cause us to record a charge of approximately
$40 million in 2005. The $400 million becomes due in
March 2011. Until then, the gains or losses caused by the
exchange rate fluctuations have no effect on cash flow.

standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The more significant of such policies
are briefly discussed below.

Nature of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration,
development and production, and the acquisition of properties.
Such activities domestically are concentrated in four geographic
areas:

Devon’s Canadian activities are located primarily in the
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, and Devon’s
international activities — outside of North
America — are located primarily in Azerbaijan, China,
Egypt, and areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea,
Gabon and Cote d’Ivoire.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations which are
responsible for marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and
constructing and operating pipelines, storage and treating
facilities and gas processing plants. These services are
performed for Devon as well as for unrelated third parties.

The accounts of Devon’s wholly owned subsidiaries are
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items
subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of
proved reserves and related present value estimates of future
net revenue, the carrying value of oil and gas properties,
goodwill impairment assessment, asset retirement obligations,
income taxes, valuation of derivative instruments, obligations
related to employee benefits and legal and environmental risks
and exposures. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

Property and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
incurred that are directly identified with acquisition,
exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for
its own account, and which are not related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities, are also
capitalized. Interest costs incurred and attributable to
unproved oil and gas properties under current evaluation and
major development projects of oil and gas properties are also
capitalized.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unproved properties are excluded from amortized capitalized
costs until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can
be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved
properties for impairment quarterly. Significant unproved
properties are assessed individually. Costs of insignificant
unproved properties are transferred to amortizable costs over
average holding periods ranging from three years for onshore
properties to seven years for offshore properties.

Net capitalized costs are limited to the estimated future net
revenues, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil,
natural gas and NGL reserves plus the cost of properties not
subject to amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude
future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement
obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas
properties. Such limitations are imposed separately on a
country-by-country basis and are tested quarterly. Capitalized
costs are depleted by an equivalent unit-of-production method,
converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of
natural gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is calculated using
the capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement
obligations, plus the estimated future expenditures (based on
current costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves, net
of estimated salvage values. No gain or loss is recognized upon
disposal of oil and gas properties unless such disposal
significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs
and proved reserves in a particular country. All costs related
to production activities, including workover costs incurred
solely to maintain or increase levels of production from an
existing completion interval, are charged to expense as incurred.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a
units-of-production basis. Depreciation and amortization of
other property and equipment, including corporate and other
midstream assets and leasehold improvements, are provided using
the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives from
three to 39 years.

Effective January 1, 2003, Devon adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(“SFAS No. 143”) using a cumulative
effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset
retirement obligations, asset retirement costs and accumulated
depreciation. SFAS No. 143 requires liability
recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets, such as producing well sites, offshore
production platforms, and natural gas processing plants. The
obligations included within the scope of SFAS No. 143
are those for which a company faces a legal obligation. The
initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to
record a separate liability at its fair value with an offsetting
asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the related
property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. The
asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and
rational method similar to that used for the associated property
and equipment.

Devon previously estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site
reclamation, and other similar activities in the total costs
that are subject to depreciation, depletion, and amortization.
However, Devon did not record a separate asset or liability for
such amounts. Upon adoption, Devon recorded a
cumulative-effect-type adjustment for an increase to net
earnings of $16 million net of deferred taxes of
$10 million. Additionally, Devon established an asset
retirement obligation of $453 million, an increase to
property and equipment of $400 million and a decrease in
accumulated DD&A of $79 million.

Assuming the provisions of SFAS No. 143 had been
adopted as of January 1, 2002, Devon’s 2002 net
earnings would have been $5 million less than the reported
2002 net earnings. This would have also resulted in a $0.02
and $0.01 reduction to 2002 basic and diluted net earnings
applicable to common stockholders, respectively.

In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 106 (“SAB No. 106”)
to provide guidance regarding the interaction of
SFAS No. 143 with the full cost method of accounting
for oil and gas properties. Specifically, SAB No. 106
clarifies the manner in which the full cost ceiling test and
depletion of oil and gas properties should be calculated in
accordance with the provisions of



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 143. Devon adopted SAB No. 106
prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2004. However, this
adoption did not materially impact the full cost ceiling test
calculation or depletion for 2004.

Short-Term Investments and Other Marketable
    Securities

Devon reports its short-term investments and other marketable
securities at fair value, except for debt securities in which
management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, Devon’s short-term
investments consisted of $967 million and
$341 million, respectively, of auction rate securities
classified as available for sale. Although Devon’s auction
rate securities have contractual maturities of more than
10 years, the underlying interest rates on such securities
reset at intervals ranging from 7 to 49 days.
Therefore, these auction rate securities are priced and
subsequently trade as short-term investments because of the
interest rate reset feature. As a result, Devon has classified
its auction rate securities as short-term investments in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The 2003 balance of
such securities was previously classified as cash equivalents
due to the liquidity and pricing reset feature. In 2004, these
securities were reclassified as short-term investments to
conform to current year presentation. There was no impact on net
earnings or cash flow from operations as a result of the
reclassification.

Devon’s only other significant investment security is its
investment in approximately 14.2 million shares of
ChevronTexaco Corporation (“ChevronTexaco”) common
stock which is reported at fair value. Except for unrealized
losses that are determined to be “other than
temporary”, the tax effected unrealized gain or loss on the
investment in ChevronTexaco common stock is recognized in other
comprehensive income (loss) and reported as a separate component
of stockholders’ equity.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
fourth quarters of 2004, 2003 and 2002. Based on these
assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold
to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery
has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectibility of
the revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is
transferred when production has been delivered to a pipeline or
truck or a tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating
to future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
recognition criteria are met.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
properties. These differences create imbalances that are
recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining
reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced
owner to recoup its entitled share through production. If an
imbalance exists at the time the wells’ reserves are
depleted, settlements are made among the joint interest owners
under a variety of arrangements. The liability is priced based
on current market prices. No receivables are recorded for those
wells where Devon has taken less than its share of production
unless all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
fixed or determinable price, when delivery or performance has
occurred and title has transferred, and if collectibility of the
revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to
Devon’s NGL purchase and processing contracts are reported
on a gross basis since Devon takes title to the products and has
risks and rewards of ownership. The gas purchased under these
contracts is processed in Devon-owned plants.

Major Purchasers

No purchaser accounted for over 10% of revenues in 2004, 2003
and 2002.

Derivative Instruments

Devon enters into oil and gas financial instruments to manage
its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Devon has also
entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to
interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps mitigate
either the effects of interest rate fluctuations on interest
expense for variable-rate debt instruments, or the debt fair
values for fixed-rate debt.

All derivatives are recognized as fair value of financial
instruments on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair
value. A substantial portion of Devon’s derivatives
consists of contracts that hedge the price of future oil and
natural gas production. These derivative contracts are cash flow
hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore,
while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated
as of the end of each reporting period, the changes in the fair
values attributable to the effective portion of these hedging
instruments are not included in Devon’s consolidated
results of operations. Instead, the changes in fair value of the
effective portion of these hedging instruments, net of tax, are
recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income, a
component of stockholders’ equity, until the hedged oil or
natural gas quantities are produced. The ineffective portion of
these hedging instruments is included in consolidated results of
operations.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, Devon designates its
cash flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative
contract is entered into or the date of a business combination
which includes cash flow hedge instruments. Additionally, Devon
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Devon also
assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of hedged items. If Devon fails to meet the requirements
for using hedge accounting treatment or the hedged



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transaction is no longer likely to occur, the changes in fair
value of these hedging instruments would not be recorded
directly to equity but in the consolidated results of
operations. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were no gains or
losses reclassified into earnings as a result of the
discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment for any of
Devon’s derivatives.

By using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in
commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes itself to
credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the
counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative
contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are
placed with counterparties that Devon believes are minimal
credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative
contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed
by management to be competent and competitive market makers.

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative
instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or
interest rates. The market risk associated with commodity price
and interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and
monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market
risk that may be undertaken. The oil and gas reference prices
upon which the commodity hedging instruments are based reflect
various market indices that have a high degree of historical
correlation with actual prices received by Devon.

Devon does not hold or issue derivative instruments for
speculative trading purposes. Devon’s commodity costless
price collars and price swaps have been designated as cash flow
hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
reported on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive
income. These amounts are reclassified to oil and gas sales when
the forecasted transaction takes place.

During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Devon recorded in its statements of
operations a loss of $62 million, a gain of $1 million
and a gain of $28 million, respectively, for the change in
the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, as well as the ineffectiveness of
derivatives that do qualify as hedges.

As of December 31, 2004, $395 million of net deferred
losses on derivative instruments accumulated in accumulated
other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to
oil and gas sales during the next 12 months assuming no
change in the forward commodity prices from the
December 31, 2004 forward prices. Transactions and events
expected to occur over the next 12 months that will
necessitate reclassifying these derivatives’ losses to
earnings are primarily the production and sale of oil and
natural gas which includes the production hedged under the
various derivative instruments. Presently, the maximum term over
which Devon has hedged exposures to the variability of cash
flows for commodity price risk under its various derivative
instruments is 12 months.

Common Stock

On September 27, 2004, Devon declared a two-for-one stock
split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders
of record on October 29, 2004. Common stock shares and per
share amounts for prior years have been restated to reflect this
two-for-one stock split.

Stock Options

Devon applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and related
interpretations, in accounting for its fixed plan stock options.
As such, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant
only if the current market price of the underlying stock
exceeded the exercise price. SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

(“SFAS No. 123”) established accounting
and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As allowed by SFAS No. 123, Devon has elected to
continue to apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
described above, and has adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 123.

Had Devon elected the fair value provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and recognized compensation expense over
the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock options
granted as of their grant date, Devon’s 2004, 2003 and 2002
pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share
would have differed from the amounts actually reported as shown
in the following table.

The weighted average fair values of stock options granted during
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $10.32, $8.14 and $7.63, respectively.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated for disclosure
purposes on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model with the following assumptions for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 3.2%, 2.8% and
3.2%; dividend yields of 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.4%; expected lives of
four, four and five years; and volatility of the price of the
underlying common stock of 32.2%, 37.9% and 41.8%.

Income Taxes

Devon accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well
as the future tax consequences attributable to the future
utilization of existing tax net operating loss and other types
of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences and
carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. For 2004, undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries were determined to be permanently reinvested.
Therefore, no U.S. deferred income taxes were provided on
such amounts at December 31, 2004.

In October 2004, Congress enacted new tax legislation allowing
qualifying corporations to repatriate cash from foreign
operations at a reduced income tax rate. In addition, this tax
legislation creates a new U.S. tax deduction which will be
phased in starting in 2005 for companies with domestic production

activities, including oil and gas extraction. In the first
quarter of 2005, Devon’s board of directors approved the
repatriation of $500 million of earnings from Canadian
operations which will be taxed at the reduced income tax rate.
As a result, Devon will recognize in the first quarter of 2005
approximately $30 million of additional current income tax
expense (which would have been the same approximate amount
recognized in 2004 if Devon had finalized its repatriation plans
prior to 2005).

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Net Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
Devon’s dilutive outstanding stock options were exercised
(calculated using the treasury stock method), if the preferred
stock of a subsidiary were converted to common stock and if
Devon’s zero coupon convertible senior debentures were
converted to common stock.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table reconciles the net earnings and common
shares outstanding used in the calculations of basic and diluted
earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

The senior convertible debentures included in the 2004 and 2003
dilution calculations were not included in the 2002 dilution
calculation because the effect of inclusion was anti-dilutive.

Certain options to purchase shares of Devon’s common stock

options’ exercise price exceeded the average market price

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments

Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as
their functional currency. Therefore, the assets and liabilities
of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars based on the current exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet dates, while income and expenses are
translated at average rates for the periods presented.
Translation adjustments have no effect on net income and are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. Devon’s International
subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency.

Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Devon
considers all highly liquid investments with original
contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

Commitments and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
be reasonably estimated.

Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Liabilities for these expenditures are
recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Reference is made
to Note 14 for a discussion of amounts recorded for these
liabilities.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Adopted

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”,
(“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which is a revision of
SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25
regarding stock-based employee compensation plans. APB Opinion
No. 25 requires recognition of compensation expense only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
stock option exercise price on the date of grant. Additionally,
SFAS No. 123 established fair value-based accounting
for stock-based employee compensation plans but allowed pro
forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement
recognition. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to
be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Also, pro forma
disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based
payments is no longer an alternative. Devon will adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) in the third quarter of
2005 and anticipates adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using
the modified prospective method. Under this method, Devon will
recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards
granted or modified on or after July 1, 2005, as well as
any previously granted awards that are not fully vested as of
July 1, 2005. Compensation expense will be measured based
on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in
developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123. Devon is currently
assessing the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on
consolidated results of operations. However, Devon does not
expect such impact to be material upon adoption in the third
quarter of 2005.

On April 25, 2003, Devon completed its merger with Ocean
Energy, Inc. (“Ocean”). In the transaction, Devon
issued 0.828 shares of its common stock for each
outstanding share of Ocean common stock (or a total of
approximately 148 million shares). Also, Devon assumed
approximately $1.8 billion of debt (current and long-term)

Investment in ChevronTexaco Corporation Common Stock

In the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon recorded a
$205 million other-than-temporary impairment of its
investment in 14.2 million shares of ChevronTexaco common
stock. Devon acquired these shares in its August 1999
acquisition of PennzEnergy Company. The shares are deposited
with an exchange agent for possible exchange for
$760 million of debentures that are exchangeable into the
ChevronTexaco shares.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The debentures, which mature in August 2008, were also assumed
by Devon in the 1999 PennzEnergy acquisition.

At the closing date of the PennzEnergy acquisition, Devon
initially recorded the ChevronTexaco common shares at their fair
value, which was $47.69 per share, or an aggregate value of
$677 million. Since then, as the ChevronTexaco shares have
fluctuated in market value, the value of the shares on
Devon’s balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable
market value. Through September 30, 2002, any decreases in
the value of the ChevronTexaco common shares were determined by
Devon to be temporary in nature. Therefore, the changes in value
were recorded directly to stockholders’ equity and were not
recorded in Devon’s results of operations through
September 30, 2002.

The determination that a decline in value of the ChevronTexaco
shares is temporary or other than temporary is subjective and
influenced by many factors. Among these factors are the
significance of the decline as a percentage of the original
cost, the length of time the stock price has been below original
cost, the performance of the stock price in relation to the
stock price of its competitors within the industry and the
market in general, and whether the decline is attributable to
specific adverse conditions affecting ChevronTexaco.

Beginning in July 2002, the market value of ChevronTexaco common
stock began a significant decline. The price per share decreased
from $44.25 at June 30, 2002, to $34.63 per share at
September 30, 2002, and to $33.24 per share at
December 31, 2002. The 2002 year-end price of $33.24
represented a 25% decline since June 30, 2002, and a 30%
decline from the original valuation in August 1999. As a result
of the decline in value during the fourth quarter of 2002, Devon
determined that the decline was other than temporary, as that
term is defined by accounting rules. Therefore, the
$205 million cumulative decrease in the value of the
ChevronTexaco common shares from the initial acquisition in
August 1999 to December 31, 2002, was recorded as a noncash
charge to Devon’s results of operations in the fourth
quarter of 2002. Net of the applicable tax benefit, the charge
reduced net earnings by $128 million.

The share price of ChevronTexaco common stock has increased to
$43.19 at December 31, 2003 and $52.51 at December 31,
2004. As a result, the market value of Devon’s investment
in ChevronTexaco common stock increased $273 million from
December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2004. The changes in
the value of the shares since December 31, 2002, net of
applicable taxes, have been recorded directly to accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.
However, depending on the future performance of
ChevronTexaco’s common stock, Devon may be required to
record additional noncash charges in future periods if the value
of such stock declines, and Devon determines that such declines
are other than temporary.

Credit Facilities with Banks

Devon has a $1.5 billion five-year, syndicated, unsecured
revolving line of credit (the “Senior Credit
Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes (i) a
five-year revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
U.S. $500 million and (ii) a $1 billion
sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit, including
letters of credit under the Canadian subfacility.

The Senior Credit Facility matures on April 8, 2009, and
all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time
unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 8
anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of
the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
of the lenders. Devon has obtained lender approval to extend the
current maturity date of April 8, 2009 to April 8,
2010. This maturity date extension will be effective on
April 8, 2005 provided Devon has not experienced a
“material adverse effect,” as defined in the Senior
Credit Facility agreement, at that date.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the
election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options
for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally
less than the prime rate. Devon may also elect to borrow at the
prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides for an
annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable
quarterly in arrears.

The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility contains
certain covenants and restrictions, including a maximum allowed
debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as defined in the agreement.
At December 31, 2004, Devon was in compliance with such
covenants and restrictions. Devon’s debt-to-capitalization
ratio at December 31, 2004, as calculated pursuant to the
terms of the agreement, was 33.0%.

As of December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility. The available capacity under the Senior
Credit Facility as of December 31, 2004, net of
$226 million of outstanding letters of credit, was
approximately $1.3 billion.

Commercial Paper

Devon also has a commercial paper program under which it may
borrow up to $725 million. Borrowings under the commercial
paper program reduce available capacity under the Senior Credit
Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The commercial paper
borrowings may have terms of up to 365 days and bear
interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The
interest rate is based on a standard index such as the Federal
Funds Rate, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the money
market rate as found on the commercial paper market. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, Devon had no commercial paper
debt outstanding.

Exchangeable Debentures

The exchangeable debentures consist of $444 million of
4.90% debentures and $316 million of
4.95% debentures. The exchangeable debentures were issued
on August 3, 1998 and mature August 15, 2008. The
exchangeable debentures were callable beginning August 15,
2000, initially at 104.0% of principal and at prices declining
to 100.5% of principal on or after August 15, 2007. At
December 31, 2004, the call price was 102.0% of principal.
The exchangeable debentures are exchangeable at the option of
the holders at any time prior to maturity, unless previously
redeemed, for shares of ChevronTexaco common stock. In lieu of
delivering ChevronTexaco common stock to an exchanging debenture
holder, Devon may, at its option, pay to such holder an amount
of cash equal to the market value of the ChevronTexaco common
stock. At maturity, holders who have not exercised their
exchange rights will receive an amount in cash equal to the
principal amount of the debentures.

As of December 31, 2004, Devon beneficially owned
approximately 14.2 million shares of ChevronTexaco common
stock. These shares have been deposited with an exchange agent
for possible exchange for the exchangeable debentures. Each
$1,000 principal amount of the exchangeable debentures is
exchangeable into 18.6566 shares of ChevronTexaco common
stock, an exchange rate equivalent to $53.60 per share of
ChevronTexaco stock.

The exchangeable debentures were assumed as part of the
PennzEnergy merger. The fair values of the exchangeable
debentures were determined as of August 17, 1999, based on
market quotations. In accordance with derivative accounting
standards, the total fair value of the debentures has been
allocated between the interest-bearing debt and the option to
exchange ChevronTexaco common stock that is embedded in the
debentures. Accordingly, a discount was recorded on the
debentures and is being accreted using the effective interest
method which raised the effective interest rate on the
debentures to 7.76%.

Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures

In June 2000, Devon privately sold zero coupon convertible
senior debentures. The debentures were sold at a price of
$464.13 per debenture with a yield to maturity of
3.875% per annum. Each of the 760,000 debentures is
convertible into 11.5186 shares of Devon common stock.
Devon may call the debentures at any time after five years, and
a debenture holder has the right to require Devon to repurchase
the debentures after five, 10 and 15 years, at the issue
price plus accrued original issue discount and interest. The
first put date is June 26, 2005, at an accreted value of
$427 million. Therefore, Devon has classified these
debentures as current liabilities in the December 31, 2004
consolidated balance sheet. Devon has the right to satisfy its
obligation by paying cash or issuing shares of Devon common
stock with a value equal to its obligation. Devon’s
proceeds were approximately $346 million, net of debt
issuance costs of approximately $7 million. Devon used the
proceeds from the sale of these debentures to pay down other
domestic long-term debt.

Other Debentures and Notes

Following are descriptions of the various other debentures and
notes outstanding at December 31, 2004, as listed in the

On August 4, 2003, Devon issued these notes which are
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon. The proceeds
from the issuance of these debt securities, net of discounts and
issuance costs, of $498 million were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the $3 billion term loan credit facility.

10.25% Debentures due November 1, 2005 and
    10.125% Debentures due November 15, 2009

These debentures were assumed as part of the PennzEnergy
acquisition. The fair values of the respective debentures were
determined using August 17, 1999, market interest rates. As
a result, premiums were recorded on these debentures which
lowered their effective interest rates to 8.3% and 8.9% on the
$236 million of 10.25% debentures and
$177 million of 10.125% debentures, respectively. The
premiums are being amortized using the effective interest method.

6.875% Notes due September 30, 2011 and
    7.875% Debentures due September 30, 2031

On October 3, 2001, Devon, through Devon Financing
Corporation, U.L.C. (“Devon Financing”), sold these
notes and debentures which are unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of Devon Financing. Devon has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated
basis the obligations of Devon Financing under the debt
securities. The proceeds from the issuance of these debt
securities were used to fund a portion of the Anderson
acquisition. The $3 billion of debt securities were
structured in a manner that results in an expected weighted
average after-tax borrowing rate of approximately 1.65%.

7.95% Notes due April 15, 2032

On March 25, 2002, Devon sold these notes which are
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon. The net
proceeds received, after discounts and issuance costs, were
$986 million and were partially used to pay down
$820 million on Devon’s $3 billion term loan
credit facility. The remaining $166 million of net proceeds
was used in June 2002 to partially fund the early extinguishment
of $175 million of 8.75% senior subordinated notes due
June 15, 2007. The notes were redeemed at 104.375% of
principal, or approximately $183 million.

Interest Expense

Following are the components of interest expense for the years
2004, 2003 and 2002:

Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates

The $400 million of 6.75% fixed-rate senior notes referred
to in the first table of this note are payable by a Canadian
subsidiary of Devon. However, the notes are denominated in
U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar from the dates the
notes were assumed as part of an acquisition to the date of
repayment increase or decrease the expected amount of Canadian
dollars eventually required to repay the notes. Such changes in
the Canadian dollar equivalent of the debt and certain cash and
other working capital amounts of Devon’s Canadian
subsidiary which are also denominated in U.S. dollars are
required to be included in determining net earnings for the
period in which the exchange rate changed. As a result of
changes in the rate of conversion of Canadian dollars to
U.S. dollars, $22 million, $69 million and
$1 million was recorded as a reduction of expense in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes

At December 31, 2004, Devon had the following net operating
loss carryforwards which are available to reduce future taxable
income in the jurisdiction where the net operating loss was
incurred. These carryforwards will result in a future tax
reduction based upon the future tax rate applicable to the
taxable income that is ultimately offset by the net operating
loss carryforward.

Additionally, at December 31, 2004, Devon had

which have no expiration and are available to reduce future
income taxes. The net operating loss and minimum tax credit
carryforward amounts have been recognized for financial purposes
to reduce the deferred tax liability at December 31, 2004.

The earnings (loss) before income taxes and the components of
income tax expense (benefit) for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002
were as follows:

The taxes on the results of discontinued operations presented in
the accompanying statements of operations were all related to

Total income tax expense (benefit) differed from the amounts

and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a
result of the following:

During 2004 and 2003, total income tax expense was reduced by
the effects of Canadian statutory rate reductions. As presented
in the table above, these rate reductions resulted in a
$36 million and $218 million benefit being recorded in
2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the lower tax rates
being applied to deferred tax liabilities outstanding as of the
beginning of the year.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities
at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are presented below:



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
$956 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
2004. Such amount consists of $336 million of various
carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The
carryforwards include federal net operating loss carryforwards,
the majority of which do not begin to expire until 2020, state
net operating loss carryforwards which expire primarily between
2005 and 2022, Canadian net operating loss carryforwards which
expire primarily between 2006 and 2014, and Azerbaijani net
operating loss carryforwards and U.S. minimum tax credit
carryforwards which have no expiration. The tax benefits of
carryforwards are recorded as an asset to the extent that
management assesses the utilization of such carryforwards to be
“more likely than not.” When the future utilization of
some portion of the carryforwards is determined not to be
“more likely than not,” a valuation allowance is
provided to reduce the recorded tax benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the net operating loss
carryforwards to be utilized between 2005 and 2009. Such
expectation is based upon current estimates of taxable income
during this period, considering limitations on the annual
utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax regulations.
Significant changes in such estimates caused by variables such
as future oil and gas prices or capital expenditures could alter
the timing of the eventual utilization of such carryforwards.
There can be no assurance that Devon will generate any specific
level of continuing taxable earnings. However, management
believes that Devon’s future taxable income will more
likely than not be sufficient to utilize substantially all its
tax carryforwards prior to their expiration.

10.

Preferred Stock of a Subsidiary

At December 31, 2003, a subsidiary of Devon created in the
Ocean merger had 38,000 shares of convertible preferred
stock outstanding. In January 2004, these shares of convertible
preferred stock were canceled and converted to
2,197,160 shares of Devon common stock pursuant to an
automatic conversion feature of the preferred stock. The
automatic conversion feature was triggered when the closing
price of Devon common stock equaled or exceeded the forced
conversion price of $26.20 for 20 consecutive trading days.

11.

Stockholders’ Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of
800 million shares of common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, and 4.5 million shares of preferred
stock, par value $1.00 per share. The preferred stock may
be issued in one or more series, and the terms and rights of
such stock will be determined by the Board of Directors.

There were 32 million exchangeable shares issued on
December 10, 1998, in connection with the Northstar Energy
Corporation combination. These shares were essentially
equivalent to Devon common stock and were exchangeable at any
time, on a one-for-one basis, for common shares of Devon at the
holder’s option. The last remaining exchangeable shares
outstanding were exchanged for Devon common stock on
August 27, 2004.

Effective August 17, 1999, Devon issued 1.5 million
shares of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock, Series A, to
holders of PennzEnergy 6.49% cumulative preferred stock,
Series A. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative
from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly, in
cash, when declared by the Board of Directors. The preferred
stock is redeemable at the option of Devon at any time on or
after June 2, 2008, in whole or in part, at a redemption
price of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends
to the redemption date.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated a certain number
of shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
Preferred Stock”) in connection with the adoption of the
shareholder rights plan described later in this note. On
April 25, 2003, the Board



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

increased the designated shares from 2.0 million to
2.9 million. At December 31, 2004, there were no
shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock issued or
outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per share
equal to the greater of $1.00 or 200 times the aggregate per
share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends)
declared on common stock since the immediately preceding
quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first
payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior
Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred
Stock are entitled to 200 votes per share (subject to adjustment
to prevent dilution) on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
neither redeemable nor convertible. The Series A Junior
Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but junior to
all other classes of Preferred Stock.

On September 27, 2004, Devon announced a stock buyback
program to repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common
stock. During 2004, Devon repurchased 5 million shares at a
total cost of $189 million, or $37.78 per share. Devon
intends to continue repurchasing its shares in the open market
and in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market
conditions. The stock repurchase program may be discontinued at
any time.

Stock Option Plans

Devon has outstanding stock options issued to key management and
professional employees under three stock option plans adopted in
1993, 1997 and 2003 (the “1993 Plan,” the “1997
Plan” and the “2003 Plan”). Options granted under
the 1993 Plan and 1997 Plan remain exercisable by the employees
owning such options, but no new options will be granted under
these plans. At December 31, 2004, there were 202,000 and
8,774,000 options outstanding under the 1993 Plan and the 1997
Plan, respectively.

On April 25, 2003, Devon’s stockholders adopted the
2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The new long-term incentive plan
authorizes the compensation committee of Devon’s Board of
Directors to grant nonqualified and incentive stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance
units and performance bonuses to selected employees. The plan
also authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards to directors. A total of
25,000,000 shares of Devon common stock have been reserved
for issuance pursuant to the plan. Of these shares, no more than
5,000,000 shares may be granted as restricted stock,
performance bonuses and performance units. During 2004 and 2003,
1,703,000 and 1,306,000 restricted stock awards, respectively,
were granted which are subject to pro rata vesting over a
four-year period. These awards had an aggregate fair value of
$66 million and $34 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and will be recorded as compensation expense over
the vesting period.

The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2003 Plan
may not be less than the estimated fair market value of the
stock at the date of grant. Options granted are exercisable
during a period

established for each grant, which period may not exceed eight
years from the date of grant. Under the 2003 Plan, the grantee
must pay the exercise price in cash or in common stock, or a
combination thereof, at the time that the option is exercised.
The 2003 Plan is administered by a committee comprised of
non-management members of the Board of Directors. The 2003 Plan
expires on April 25, 2013. As of December 31, 2004,
there were 5,906,000 options outstanding under the 2003 Plan.
There were 16,022,000 options available for future grants as of
December 31, 2004.

In addition to the stock options outstanding under the 1993
Plan, 1997 Plan and 2003 Plan there were approximately
2,739,000, 363,000, 200,000 and 1,591,000 stock options
outstanding at the end of 2004 that were assumed as part of the
Ocean merger, the Mitchell merger, the Santa Fe Snyder
merger and the PennzEnergy merger, respectively.

A summary of the status of Devon’s stock option plans as of
December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, and changes during each
of the years then ended, is presented below.

Shareholder Rights Plan

Under Devon’s shareholder rights plan, stockholders have
one half of one right for each share of common stock held. The
rights become exercisable and separately transferable ten
business days after (a) an announcement that a person has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
voting shares outstanding, or (b) commencement of a tender
or exchange offer that could result in a person owning 15% or
more of the voting shares outstanding.

Each right entitles its holder (except a holder who is the
acquiring person) to purchase either (a) 1/100 of a share
of Series A Preferred Stock for $185.00, subject to
adjustment or, (b) Devon common stock with a value equal to
twice the exercise price of the right, subject to adjustment to
prevent dilution. In the event of certain merger or asset sale
transactions with another party or transactions which would
increase the equity ownership of a shareholder who then owned
15% or more of Devon, each Devon right will entitle its holder
to purchase securities of the merging or acquiring party with a
value equal to twice the exercise price of the right.

The rights, which have no voting power, expire on
August 17, 2009. The rights may be redeemed by Devon for
$.01 per right until the rights become exercisable.

Dividends

Dividends on Devon’s common stock were paid in 2004 at a
per share rate of $0.05 per quarter. Dividends on
Devon’s common stock were paid in 2003 and 2002 at a per
share rate of $0.025 per quarter.

carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable (including
income taxes payable and accrued expenses) included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value
at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Investment in ChevronTexaco Corporation common
stock

— The fair value of this investment is based
on a quoted market price.

Oil and Gas Price Hedge Agreements

— The fair
values of the oil and gas price hedges are based on either
(a) an internal discounted cash flow calculation,
(b) quotes obtained from the counterparty to the hedge
agreement or (c) quotes provided by brokers.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— The fair values
of the interest rate swaps are based on internal discounted cash
flow calculations, using market quotes of future interest rates,
or quotes obtained from counterparties.

Electricity Hedge Agreements

— The fair values
of the electricity hedges are based on internal discounted cash
flow calculations.

Embedded Option in Exchangeable Debentures

—
The fair value of the embedded option is based on a quote
obtained from a broker.

Long-term Debt

— The fair values of the
fixed-rate long-term debt are based on quotes obtained from
brokers or by discounting the principal and interest payments at
rates available for debt of similar terms and maturity. The fair
values of the floating-rate long-term debt are estimated to
approximate the carrying amounts due to the fact that the
interest rates paid on such debt are generally set for periods
of three months or less.

Preferred Stock of a Subsidiary

— The fair
value of the preferred stock is based upon quotes obtained from
brokers.

Devon’s total hedged positions as of December 31, 2004
are set forth in the following tables.

Price Swaps

Through various price swaps, Devon has fixed the price it will
receive on a portion of its oil and natural gas production in
2005. These swaps will result in the fixed prices included
below. Where



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

necessary, the oil and gas prices related to these swaps have
been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted
against the price recorded by Devon, and the gas price has also
been adjusted for the Btu content of the production that has
been hedged.

Costless Price Collars

Devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a
floor and ceiling price for a portion of its 2005 oil production
that is otherwise subject to floating prices. The floor and
ceiling prices related to domestic and Canadian oil production
are based on the NYMEX price. The floor and ceiling prices
related to international oil production are based on the Brent
price. If the NYMEX or Brent price is outside of the ranges set
by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon
and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference.
As long as Devon meets the ongoing requirements of hedge
accounting for its derivatives, any such settlements will either
increase or decrease Devon’s oil revenues for the period.
Because Devon’s oil volumes are often sold at prices that
differ from the NYMEX or Brent price due to differing quality
(i.e., sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude) and
transportation costs from different geographic areas, the floor
and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual
limits of Devon’s realized prices for the production
volumes related to the collars.

Devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a
floor and ceiling price for a portion of its 2005 natural gas
production that otherwise is subject to floating prices. If the
applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set
by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon
and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference.
Any such settlements will either increase or decrease
Devon’s gas revenues for the period. Because Devon’s
gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the
related regional indices, and due to differing Btu contents of
gas produced, the floor and ceiling prices of the various
collars do not reflect actual limits of Devon’s realized
prices for the production volumes related to the collars.

The floor and ceiling prices shown in the following table are
weighted averages of the various collars. The international oil
prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a
NYMEX-based price, using Devon’s estimates of 2005
differentials between NYMEX and the Brent price upon which the
collars are based.

The natural gas prices shown in the following table have been
adjusted to a NYMEX-based price, using Devon’s estimates of
future differentials between NYMEX and the specific regional
indices upon

Retirement Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for U.S. and
Canadian employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
employee’s years of service and compensation and are funded
from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

During 2002, Devon established a funding policy regarding the
Qualified Plans such that it would contribute the amount of
funds necessary so that the Qualified Plans’ assets would
be approximately equal to the related accumulated benefit
obligation by the end of 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the
fair value of the Qualified Plans’ assets was
$456 million, which was $11 million more than the
related accumulated benefit obligation. The actual amount of
contributions required during future periods will depend on



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

investment returns from the plan assets during the same period
as well as changes in long-term interest rates.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
are based on the employee’s years of service and
compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
established trusts to fund these plans’ benefit
obligations. The total values of these trusts were
$60 million and $66 million at December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively, and are included in noncurrent other
assets in the consolidated balance sheets. For the remaining
Supplemental Plans for which trusts have not been established,
benefits are funded from Devon’s available cash and cash
equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
(“Postretirement Plans”) which provide benefits for
substantially all employees. The Postretirement Plans provide
medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and are,
depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
Plans are estimated based on future cost-sharing changes that
are consistent with Devon’s expressed intent to increase,
where possible, contributions from future retirees. Devon’s
funding policy for the Postretirement Plans is to fund the
benefits as they become payable with available cash and cash
equivalents.

Benefit Obligations

Devon uses a measurement date of December 31 for its
pension and postretirement benefit plans. The following table
presents the plans’ benefit obligations and the
weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to calculate such
obligations at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The benefit
obligation for pension plans represents the projected benefit
obligation, while the benefit obligation for the postretirement
benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit obligation. The
accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected
benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption
about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit
obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2004 and 2003
was $542 million and $475 million, respectively.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For measurement purposes, a 10% annual rate of increase in the
per capita cost of covered health care benefits, excluding
prescription benefits, was assumed for 2005. The rate was
assumed to decrease one percent annually to 5% in the year 2010
and remain at that level thereafter. Additionally, an 11% annual
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered prescription
benefits was assumed for 2005. The rate was assumed to decrease
approximately one percent annually to 5.25% in the year 2010 and
remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase
in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the
December 31, 2004 postretirement benefit obligation by
$2 million, while a one-percentage-point decrease in the
same rate would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation
by $1 million.

Plan Assets

The following table presents the plans’ assets at
December 31, 2004 and 2003.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The plan assets for pension benefits in the table above excludes
the assets held in trusts for the Supplemental Plans. However,
employer contributions for pension benefits in the table above
include $6 million in 2004 and $22 million in 2003
which were transferred from the trusts established for the
Supplemental Plans.

Devon’s overall investment objective for its retirement
plans’ assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested
capital to ensure payments of retirement benefits obligations
can be funded when required. To assist in achieving this
objective, Devon has established certain investment strategies,
including target allocation percentages and permitted and
prohibited investments, designed to mitigate risks inherent with
investing. At December 31, 2004, the target investment
allocation for Devon’s plan assets is 50% U.S. large
cap equity securities; 15% U.S. small cap equity
securities, equally allocated between growth and value; 15%
international equity securities, equally allocated between
growth and value; and 20% debt securities. Derivatives or other
speculative investments considered high-risk are generally
prohibited.

The asset allocation for Devon’s retirement plans at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the target allocation for
2005, by asset category, follows:

December 31, 2004 and 2003.

During 2004 and 2003, the pre-tax change in the minimum pension
liability increased other comprehensive income by
$61 million and $28 million, respectively. During
2002, the pre-tax change in the minimum pension liability
decreased other comprehensive income by $85 million.

Certain of Devon’s pension and postretirement plans have a

Net Periodic Cost

The following table presents the plans’ net periodic
benefit cost and the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used
to calculate such cost for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by
evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
well as long-term inflation assumptions. The expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is based on the target allocation
of investment types in such assets.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit
plans. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost trend rates would affect the total service and interest
cost by less than $1 million.

In December 2003, the

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003

(“the Act”) was
signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare (“Medicare Part D”) as well as a
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
to Medicare Part D. In May 2004 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
No. 106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003”

(“FSP 106-2”). If the benefit provided is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D,
FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effect of
the subsidy on benefits attributable to past service as an
actuarial experience gain that reduces the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation and for benefits attributable
to current service as a reduction of the service cost included
in net periodic benefit cost. FSP 106-2 is effective for
the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2004.
Because benefits provided to certain participants in the
Postretirement Plans will be at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D, Devon will be entitled to some subsidy. As
a result, Devon reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at July 1, 2004, by $4 million and the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

Expected Cash Flows

Information about the expected cash flows for the pension and
other postretirement benefit plans follows:

Expected employer contributions included in the table above
include amounts related to Devon’s Qualified Plans,
Supplemental Plans and Postretirement Plans. Of the benefits
expected to be paid in 2005, $6 million is expected to be
funded from the trusts established for the Supplemental Plans
and $6 million is expected to be funded from Devon’s
available cash and cash equivalents. Expected employer
contributions and benefit payments for other postretirement
benefits are presented net of employee contributions.

Other Benefit Plans

Devon has incurred certain postemployment benefits to former or
inactive employees who are not retirees. These benefits include
salary continuance, severance and disability health care and
life insurance. The accrued postemployment benefit liability was
approximately $5 and $6 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Devon has a 401(k) Incentive Savings Plan which covers all
domestic employees. At its discretion, Devon may match a certain
percentage of the employees’ contributions to the plan. The
matching percentage is determined annually by the Board of
Directors. Devon’s matching contributions to the plan were
$11 million, $10 million and $8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee which is
based upon the employee’s base compensation and
classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
additional Devon contributions. During 2004, 2003 and 2002,
Devon’s combined contributions to the Canadian defined
contribution plan and the Canadian savings plan were
$9 million, $8 million and $8 million,
respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and
settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by
management to involve future amounts that would be material to
Devon’s financial position or results of operations after
consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could
differ materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
environmental remediation activities associated with past
operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these
activities, accruals have been established when reasonable
estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include
estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used
discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for
environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible
recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to
environmental costs have been recognized in Devon’s
consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals
when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation
estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of Devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers
are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
by third parties. As of December 31, 2004, Devon’s
consolidated balance sheet included $7 million of
non-current accrued liabilities, reflected in “Other
liabilities,” related to these and other environmental
remediation liabilities. Devon does not currently believe there
is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material
costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such
environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites
in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs, Devon’s conclusion is
based in large part on (i) Devon’s participation in
consent decrees with both other PRPs and the Environmental
Protection Agency, which provide for performing the scope of
work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue
as protection to the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as
a

de minimis

PRP, and (iii) the availability of
other defenses to liability. As a result, Devon’s monetary
exposure is not expected to be material.

Royalty Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
and related parties used below-market prices, improper
deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and
sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The
principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is

United States
ex rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al.

(the
“

Wright

case”). The suit was originally filed
in August 1996 in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000
with the other suits for pre-trial proceedings in the United
States District Court for the District of Wyoming. On
July 10, 2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the

Wright

case back to the Eastern District of Texas to
resume proceedings. Trial is set for February 2007 if the suit
continues to advance. Devon believes that it has acted
reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all
allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties in good faith.
Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material
exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has
been recorded in connection therewith.

Devon is a defendant in certain private royalty owner litigation
filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain post
production costs from royalties payable by Devon. A significant
portion of such production is, or will be, transported through
facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

which Devon owns a 75% interest. Devon believes that it has
acted reasonably and paid royalties in good faith and in
accordance with its obligations under its oil and gas leases and
applicable law, and Devon does not believe that it is subject to
material exposure in association with this litigation.

Tax Treatment of Exchangeable Debentures

As described more fully in Note 8, Devon has certain
exchangeable debentures, with a principal amount totaling
$760 million, which are exchangeable at the option of the
holders into shares of ChevronTexaco common stock owned by
Devon. The debentures were assumed, and the ChevronTexaco common
stock was acquired, by Devon in the 1999 PennzEnergy merger.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) recently examined
the 1998 income tax return of PennzEnergy’s predecessor,
and the IRS formally notified Devon in April 2004 that it
disagreed with certain tax treatments of the exchangeable
debentures and similar exchangeable debentures retired in 1998.
Devon did not agree with the IRS positions and contested the
claim of additional taxes. In June 2004, Devon formally
protested the IRS notice and requested a conference with the IRS
Appeals Office. A preliminary appeals conference was held in
October 2004, and additional appeals meetings were held in
November and December 2004. This matter was resolved in February
2005, when the IRS agreed with Devon and concluded that no taxes
were due.

Other Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge
as of the date of this report, there were no other material
pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which
any of its property is subject.

Operating Leases

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
administrative expenses under operating leases, net of sub-lease
income, was $49 million, $51 million and
$37 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003
Ocean merger. The spars are being used in the development of the
Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The operating
leases are for 20-year terms and contain various options whereby
Devon may purchase the lessors’ interests in the spars.
Total rental expense included in lease operating expenses under
these operating leases was $17 million and $11 million
in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Devon has guaranteed that the
spars will have residual values at the end of the operating
leases equal to at least 10% of the fair value of the spars at
the inception of the leases. The total guaranteed value is
$20 million in 2022. However, such amount may be reduced
under the terms of the lease agreements.

Devon also has two floating, production, storage and offloading
facilities (“FPSO”) that are being leased under
operating lease arrangements. One FPSO is being used in the
Panyu project offshore China, and the other is being used in the
Zafiro field offshore Equatorial Guinea. The China lease expires
in September 2009 and the Equatorial Guinea lease expires in
July 2009. Total rental expense included in lease operating
expenses under these operating leases was $20 million and
$6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
limitation is the discounted estimated after-tax future net
revenues from proved oil and gas properties, excluding future
cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement
obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas
properties, plus the cost of properties not subject to
amortization. The ceiling is determined separately by country.
In calculating future net revenues, prices and costs used are
those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period. These
prices are not changed except where different prices are fixed
and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining
term of those contracts. Devon has entered into various
derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. These instruments, which consist of price swaps and
costless price collars, and the related future production
volumes, are discussed in Note 12. The effect of these
hedges has been considered in calculating the full cost ceiling
limitations as of December 31, 2004. These hedges reduced
the full cost ceiling limitations for the United States, Canada
and Equatorial Guinea as of the end of 2004 by
$102 million, $77 million and $76 million,
respectively. However, the 2004 capitalized costs in these
countries did not exceed the related ceiling limitations, with
or without the effects of the hedges.

The net book value, less related deferred tax liabilities, is
compared to the ceiling on a quarterly and annual basis. Any
excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes, is
written off as an expense. An expense recorded in one period may
not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil
and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the
subsequent period.

Under the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations, acquired oil and gas properties are recorded at
estimated fair value as of the date of purchase. Devon estimates
such fair value using its estimates of future oil, gas and NGL
prices. In contrast, the ceiling calculation dictates that
prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter
are held constant indefinitely. Accordingly, the resulting value
from the ceiling calculation is not necessarily indicative of
the fair value of the reserves.

During 2003 and 2002, Devon reduced the carrying value of its
oil and gas properties by $68 million and
$651 million, respectively, due to the full cost ceiling
limitations. The after-tax effects of these



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reductions in 2003 and 2002 were $36 million and
$371 million, respectively. The following table summarizes
these reductions by geographic area.

The 2003 reduction in carrying value was related to properties
in Egypt, Russia and Indonesia. The Egyptian reduction was
primarily due to poor results of a development well that was
unsuccessful in the primary objective. Partially as a result of
this well, Devon revised Egyptian proved reserves downward. The
Russian reduction was primarily the result of additional capital
costs incurred as well as an increase in operating costs. The
Indonesian reduction was primarily related to an increase in
operating costs and a reduction in proved reserves. As a result,
Devon’s Egyptian, Russian and Indonesian costs to be
recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by
$26 million, $9 million and $1 million,
respectively. These after-tax amounts resulted in pre-tax
reductions of the carrying values of Devon’s Egyptian,
Russian and Indonesian oil and gas properties of
$45 million, $19 million and $4 million,
respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Additionally, during 2003, Devon elected to discontinue certain
exploratory activities in Ghana, certain properties in Brazil
and other smaller concessions. After meeting the drilling and
capital commitments on these properties, Devon determined that
these properties did not meet Devon’s internal criteria to
justify further investment. Accordingly, Devon recorded a
$43 million charge associated with the impairment of these
properties. The after-tax effect of this reduction was
$38 million.

The 2002 Canadian reduction was primarily the result of lower
prices. The recorded values of oil and gas properties added from
the Anderson acquisition in 2001 were based on expected future
oil and gas prices that were higher than the June 30, 2002,
prices used to calculate the Canadian ceiling.

16.

Discontinued Operations

On April 18, 2002, Devon sold its Indonesian operations to
PetroChina Company Limited for total cash consideration of
$250 million. On October 25, 2002, Devon sold its
Argentine operations to Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. for total cash
consideration of $90 million. On January 27, 2003,
Devon sold its Egyptian operations to IPR Transoil Corporation
for total cash consideration of $7 million.

As a result, Devon reclassified its Indonesian, Argentine and
Egyptian activities as discontinued operations. This
reclassification affects the 2002 presentation of financial
results. Subsequent to the sale of its Egyptian and Indonesian
operations, Devon acquired new Egyptian and Indonesian assets in
the April 2003 Ocean merger. Amounts and activities related to
these new Egyptian and Indonesian operations are included in
Devon’s continuing operations in 2004 and 2003. The

$172 million, $140 million and $97 million in the
years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also, Devon capitalizes
interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas
properties and major development projects of oil and gas
properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are included in
the costs shown in the preceding tables, were $70 million,
$50 million and $4 million in the years 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

The preceding Total and International cost incurred tables

As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2003,
Devon adopted SFAS No. 143. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 143, asset retirement costs were included in
costs incurred when expenditures for such costs were made.
Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, such costs
are now included in costs incurred when a legal obligation for
incurring such costs has occurred.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
    Flows

The accompanying tables reflect the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows relating to Devon’s
interest in proved reserves:



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices
(averaging $34.69 per barrel of oil, $5.27 per Mcf of
gas and $29.73 per barrel of natural gas liquids at
December 31, 2004) to the year-end quantities of proved
reserves, except in those instances where fixed and determinable
price changes are provided by contractual arrangements in
existence at year-end. Such arrangements include derivatives
accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Future development and production costs are computed by
estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
producing proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year,
based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing
economic conditions. Of the $4.3 billion of future
development costs, $818 million, $588 million and
$388 million are estimated to be spent in 2005, 2006 and
2007, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
Included as part of the $4.3 billion of future development
costs are $1.0 billion of future dismantlement, abandonment
and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
impact of future operations.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to Devon, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) were effective as of December 31, 2004 to
ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in
the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and
forms.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for Devon, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the
supervision and with the participation of Devon’s
management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, Devon conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
Framework”). Based on this evaluation under the COSO
Framework which was completed on February 18, 2005,
management concluded that its internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
Devon’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm who audited
Devon’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2004, as stated in their report
which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2004 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting that Devon Energy Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Devon Energy Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Devon Energy
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Also, in our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Devon Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 4, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.
