PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries
    (“Devon”), is an independent energy company engaged
    primarily in exploration, development and production of natural
    gas and oil. Our oil and gas operations are concentrated in
    various North American onshore areas in the United States and
    Canada. We also have offshore operations that are situated
    principally in the Gulf of Mexico and regions located offshore
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China.

To complement our upstream oil and gas operations, we have
    marketing and midstream operations primarily in North America.
    With these operations, we market gas, crude oil and NGLs. We
    also construct and operate pipelines, storage and treating
    facilities and natural gas processing plants. These midstream
    facilities are used to transport oil, gas, and NGLs and process
    natural gas.

We began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. We have
    been publicly held since 1988, and our common stock is listed on
    the New York Stock Exchange. Our principal and administrative
    offices are located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK

73102-8260

(telephone 405/235-3611).

Strategy

As an enterprise, we aspire to be the premier independent
    natural gas and oil company in North America. To achieve this,
    we continuously strive to optimize value for our shareholders by
    growing reserves, production, earnings and cash flows, all on a
    per share basis. We do this by:

•

exercising capital discipline;

•

investing in oil and gas properties with high operating margins;

•

balancing our reserves and production mix between natural gas
    and liquids;

•

maintaining a low overall cost structure;

•

improving performance through our marketing and midstream
    operations; and

•

preserving financial flexibility.

Over the past decade, we captured an abundance of resources by
    carrying out this strategy. We pioneered horizontal drilling in
    the Barnett Shale and extended this technique to other natural
    gas shale plays in the United States and Canada. We became
    proficient with steam-assisted gravity drainage with our
    Jackfish oil sands development in Alberta, Canada. We achieved
    key oil discoveries with our drilling in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico and offshore Brazil. We have more than tripled our proved
    oil and gas reserves since 2000, and have also assembled an
    extensive inventory of exploration assets representing
    additional unproved resources.

Building off our past successes, in November 2009, we announced
    plans to strategically reposition Devon as a high-growth, North
    American onshore exploration and production company. As part of
    this strategic repositioning, we plan to bring forward the value
    of our offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and
    countries outside North America by divesting them.

This repositioning is driven by our desire to unlock and
    accelerate the realization of the value underlying the deep
    inventory of opportunities we have. We have assembled a valuable
    portfolio of offshore assets, and we have a considerable
    inventory of premier North American onshore assets. However, our
    North American onshore assets have consistently provided us our
    highest risk-adjusted investment returns. By selling our
    offshore assets, we can more aggressively pursue the untapped
    value of these North American onshore opportunities. Besides
    reducing debt, the offshore divestiture proceeds are expected to
    provide significant funds to redeploy into our prolific North
    American onshore opportunities. With these added funds, we plan
    to accelerate the growth and realization of the value of our
    North American onshore assets.



Presentation
    of Discontinued Operations

As a result of the planned divestitures of our offshore assets,
    all amounts in this document related to our International
    operations are presented as discontinued. Therefore, financial
    data and operational data, such as reserves, production, wells
    and acreage, provided in this document exclude amounts related
    to our International operations unless otherwise provided.

Even though we are also divesting our U.S. Offshore
    operations, these properties do not qualify as discontinued
    operations under accounting rules. As such, financial and
    operational data provided in this document that pertain to our
    continuing operations include amounts related to our
    U.S. Offshore operations. Where appropriate, we have
    presented amounts related to our U.S. Offshore assets
    separate from those of our North American Onshore assets.

Development
    of Business

Since our first issuance of common stock to the public in 1988,
    we have executed strategies that have always been focused on
    growth and value creation for our shareholders. We increased our
    total proved reserves from 8 MMBoe at year-end 1987 to
    2,733 MMBoe at year-end 2009. During this same time period,
    we increased annual production from 1 MMBoe in 1987 to
    233 MMBoe in 2009. Our expansion over this time period is
    attributable to a focused mergers and acquisitions program
    spanning a number of years, as well as active and successful
    exploration and development programs in more recent years.
    Additionally, our growth has provided meaningful value creation
    for our shareholders. The growth statistics from 1987 to 2009
    translate into annual per share growth rates of 11% for
    production and 8% for reserves.

As a result of this growth, we have become one of the largest
    independent oil and gas companies in North America. During 2009,
    we continued to build off our past successes with a number of
    key accomplishments, including those discussed below.

•

Drilling Success

— We drilled 1,135 gross
    wells with a 99% success rate. As a result of our success with
    the drill-bit, we replaced approximately 213% of our 2009
    production. We added 496 MMBoe of proved reserves during
    the year with extensions, discoveries and performance revisions.
    These reserve additions were more than double the 233 MMBoe
    we produced during 2009. Besides increasing our proved reserves,
    our drilling success was also the main driver of our 5%
    production growth in 2009.

•

Barnett Shale —

We drilled 336 wells in
    the Barnett Shale field in north Texas in 2009, bringing our
    total producing wells in the field to almost 4,200 at year end.
    We exited 2009 with net Barnett Shale production at just over
    one Bcf of natural gas equivalent per day. We are currently
    running 16 operated drilling rigs in the Barnett and expect to
    drill 370 wells in the field in 2010.

•

Cana-Woodford Shale

— We drilled 47 successful
    wells in the Cana-Woodford Shale in western Oklahoma in 2009. We
    also increased our net production from this important new
    shale-gas resource by nearly 500% to an average of 39 MMcf
    of natural gas equivalent per day. We have increased our lease
    position in the Cana-Woodford Shale to 118,000 net acres
    and expect to drill approximately 85 wells in the field in
    2010.

•

Haynesville Shale

— We drilled eight
    Haynesville Shale wells in the greater Carthage area of east
    Texas in 2009. These wells have significantly de-risked our
    110,000 net Haynesville Shale acres in the Carthage area.

•

Jackfish

— In Canada, our 100-percent owned
    Jackfish oil sands project in Alberta was operational throughout
    2009. As measured by production per well and

steam-to-oil

ratio, Jackfish is one of Canada’s most commercially
    successful steam-assisted gravity drainage projects. In late
    2009, Jackfish’s gross production reached 33.7 MBbls
    of oil per day. The addition of four more producing wells is
    expected to push production to the facility’s capacity of
    35 MBbls per day in early 2010.

Construction continued throughout 2009 on a second phase of the
    Jackfish project. Jackfish 2 is also sized to produce
    35 MBbls of oil per day and will commence operations in
    2011. We expect to file a regulatory application for a third
    phase of the project in the third quarter of 2010.



•

Brazil

— Offshore Brazil, we participated in
    two significant deepwater discoveries in 2009. The
    Devon-operated Itaipu exploratory discovery followed a
    successful appraisal of the 2008 Wahoo discovery. Both Itaipu
    and Wahoo are pre-salt prospects located in the Campos Basin.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographical Areas

Notes 20 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
    our segments and geographical areas.

Oil,
    Natural Gas and NGL Marketing

The spot markets for oil, gas and NGLs are subject to volatility
    as supply and demand factors fluctuate. As detailed below, we
    sell our production under both long-term (one year or more) or
    short-term (less than one year) agreements. Regardless of the
    term of the contract, the vast majority of our production is
    sold at variable or market sensitive prices.

Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging
    arrangements or fixed-price contracts associated with a portion
    of our oil and gas production. These activities are intended to
    support targeted price levels and to manage our exposure to
    price fluctuations. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Oil
    Marketing

Our oil production is sold under both long-term and short-term
    agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although
    exact percentages vary daily, as of January 2010, approximately
    81% of our oil production was sold under short-term contracts at
    variable or market-sensitive prices. The remaining 19% of oil
    production was sold under long-term, market-indexed contracts
    that are subject to market pricing variations.

Natural
    Gas Marketing

Our gas production is also sold under both long-term and
    short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties.
    Although exact percentages vary daily, as of January 2010,
    approximately 86% of our gas production was sold under
    short-term contracts at variable or market-sensitive prices.
    These market-sensitive sales are referred to as “spot
    market” sales. Another 13% of our production was committed
    under various long-term contracts, which dedicate the gas to a
    purchaser for an extended period of time, but still at
    market-sensitive prices. The remaining 1% of our gas production
    was sold under long-term, fixed-price contracts.

NGL
    Marketing

Our NGL production is sold under both long-term and short-term
    agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although
    exact percentages vary, as of January 2010, approximately 90% of
    our NGL production was sold under short-term contracts at
    variable or market-sensitive prices. The remaining 10% of NGL
    production was sold under short-term, fixed-price contracts.

Marketing
    and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations
    is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide
    such services by gathering, processing and marketing oil, gas
    and NGL production in a timely and efficient manner. Our most
    significant midstream asset is the Bridgeport processing plant
    and gathering system located in north Texas. These facilities
    serve not only our gas production from the Barnett Shale but
    also gas production of other producers in the area. Our
    midstream assets also include our 50% interest in the Access
    Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This pipeline system
    allows us to blend our Jackfish heavy oil production with
    condensate and transport the combined product to the Edmonton
    area for sale.



Our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by:

•

selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams
    processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for
    marketing, and

•

selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport
    pipelines and unrelated third-party pipelines.

Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily
    incurred from:

•

purchasing the gas streams entering our transport pipelines and
    plants;

•

purchasing fuel needed to operate our plants, compressors and
    related pipeline facilities;

•

purchasing third-party NGLs;

•

operating our plants, gathering systems and related
    facilities; and

•

transporting products on unrelated third-party pipelines.

Customers

We sell our gas production to a variety of customers including
    pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and
    local distribution companies. Gathering systems and interstate
    and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and
    deliveries.

The principal customers for our crude oil production are
    refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have
    pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event
    pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is
    trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities.

Our NGL production is primarily sold to customers engaged in
    petrochemical, refining and heavy oil blending activities.
    Pipelines, railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products
    to market.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, no purchaser accounted for over 10%
    of our revenues.

Seasonal
    Nature of Business

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases
    during the summer months and increases during the winter months.
    Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes
    lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities,
    local distribution companies and industrial users utilize
    natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their
    anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also
    lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.

Public
    Policy and Government Regulation

The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of
    regulation throughout the world. Laws, rules, regulations and
    other policy implementations affecting the oil and gas industry
    have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment
    or expansion. Pursuant to public policy changes, numerous
    government agencies have issued extensive laws and regulations
    binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members,
    some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply.
    Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and
    gas exploration, production and marketing and midstream
    activities. These laws and regulations increase the cost of
    doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Because
    public policy changes affecting the oil and gas industry are
    commonplace and because existing laws and regulations are
    frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict
    the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and
    regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these laws
    and regulations will affect our operations in a manner
    materially different than they would affect other oil and gas
    companies of similar size and financial strength.

The following are significant areas of government control and
    regulation in the United States, Canada and other international
    locations in which we operate.



Exploration
    and Production Regulation

Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal,
    state, provincial, tribal, local and international laws and
    regulations. These regulations relate to matters that include,
    but are not limited to:

•

acquisition of seismic data;

•

location of wells;

•

drilling and casing of wells;

•

well production;

•

spill prevention plans;

•

emissions permitting;

•

use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and
    materials incidental to oil and gas operations;

•

surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells
    have been drilled;

•

calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production
    taxes;

•

plugging and abandoning of wells;

•

transportation of production; and

•

in international operations, minimum investments in the country
    of operations.

Our operations also are subject to conservation regulations,
    including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing
    units or proration units; the number of wells that may be
    drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable from oil and
    gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas
    properties. In the United States, some states allow the forced
    pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration,
    while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and
    leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas
    properties. In addition, state conservation laws generally limit
    the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain
    requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The
    effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and
    gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of
    wells or the locations at which we can drill.

Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted
    by the federal government and administered by various federal
    agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and the
    Minerals Management Service (“MMS”) of the Department
    of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed
    federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other
    matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these
    leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to
    the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in
    recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new
    rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and
    royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands.
    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also has jurisdiction
    over certain U.S. offshore activities pursuant to the Outer
    Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Royalties
    and Incentives in Canada

The royalty system in Canada is a significant factor in the
    profitability of oil and gas production. Royalties payable on
    production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by
    negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined
    by government regulation and are generally calculated as a
    percentage of the value of the gross production, with the
    royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices,
    well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date
    and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From
    time to time, the federal and provincial governments of Canada
    also have established incentive programs such as royalty rate
    reductions, royalty holidays, tax credits and fixed rate and
    profit-sharing royalties for the purpose of encouraging oil and
    gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives
    generally have the effect of increasing our revenues, earnings
    and cash flow.



The provincial government of Alberta enacted a new royalty
    regime effective January 1, 2009. The new regime links
    royalties to price and production levels and applies to both new
    and existing conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands
    projects. This regime has generally reduced our proved reserves
    and production in Alberta, as well as the related earnings and
    cash flows. Similar effects have been experienced throughout the
    oil and gas industry in Alberta. Acknowledging this impact on
    the industry, the government of Alberta has announced a
    competitiveness review to assess the impact to the industry as a
    result of the royalty changes. However, we are uncertain whether
    the current regime will be modified.

Pricing
    and Marketing in Canada

Any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract
    that exceeds a certain duration or a certain quantity requires
    an exporter to obtain export authorizations from Canada’s
    National Energy Board (“NEB”). The governments of
    Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the
    volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces
    for consumption elsewhere.

Production
    Sharing Contracts

Some of our international licenses are governed by production
    sharing contracts (“PSCs”) between the concessionaires
    and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that
    define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue
    sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries.
    Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms
    and time limits of generally 30 years. PSCs also generally
    contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. As a result,
    at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of
    return, PSCs generally allow the government agency to retain
    higher fractions of revenue.

Environmental
    and Occupational Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal,
    local and international laws and regulations concerning
    occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of
    materials into, and the protection of, the environment.
    Environmental laws and regulations relate to, among other things:

•

assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition,
    drilling or construction activities;

•

the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste
    materials;

•

the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere;

•

the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well
    and other sites, including sites of former operations; and

•

the development of emergency response and spill contingency
    plans.

The application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000
    governing environmental management systems, is required to be
    implemented for some international oil and gas operations.

We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and
    health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our
    business. We have been able to plan for and comply with
    environmental, safety and health initiatives without materially
    altering our operating strategy or incurring significant
    unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends
    and increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and
    operating expenses related to the protection of the environment
    and safety and health compliance have increased over the years
    and will likely continue to increase. We cannot predict with any
    reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning
    such matters.

We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to
    limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial
    environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and
    accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances.
    However, we do not maintain 100% coverage concerning any
    environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect
    to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a
    violation of law.



Climate
    Change

Policy makers in the United States are increasingly focusing on
    whether the emissions of “greenhouse gases,” such as
    carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to the warming of
    the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. However,
    there is currently no settled scientific consensus on whether,
    or the extent to which, human-derived greenhouse gas emissions
    contribute to climatic change. As an oil and gas company, the
    debate on climate change is relevant to our operations because
    the equipment we use to explore for, develop, produce and
    process oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases.
    Additionally, the combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as the
    oil, gas and NGLs we sell, emits carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gases. As a result, some believe that combustion of
    carbon-based fuels contributes to climate change.

Despite the lack of a settled scientific consensus on
    human-derived impacts on climate change, policy makers at both
    the United States federal and state level have introduced
    legislation and proposed new regulations that are designed to
    quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through
    inventories and limitations on greenhouse gas emissions.
    Legislative initiatives to date have focused on the development
    of “cap and trade” programs. These programs generally
    would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide
    basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or
    major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission
    allowances. As a result of a gradually declining cap, the number
    of government-issued allowances and allowances available for
    trade would be reduced each year until the overall goal of
    greenhouse gas emission reductions is achieved.

Because no final legislation or regulations limiting greenhouse
    gas emissions have been enacted at this time, it is not possible
    to estimate the costs or operational impacts we could experience
    to comply with new legislative or regulatory developments.
    Although we do not anticipate that we would be impacted to any
    greater degree than other similar oil and gas companies, a
    stringent greenhouse gas control program could increase our cost
    of doing business and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas
    that we sell. However, to the extent that any particular
    greenhouse gas program directly or indirectly encourages the use
    of natural gas, demand for the natural gas we sell could
    increase.

The Kyoto Protocol was adopted by numerous countries in 1997 and
    implemented in 2005. The Protocol requires reductions of certain
    emissions of greenhouse gases. Although the United States has
    not ratified the Protocol, certain countries in which we operate
    have. Canada ratified the Protocol in April 2007 and released
    its Regulatory Framework for Air Emissions. The Canadian
    framework is a plan to implement mandatory reductions in
    greenhouse gas emissions. The mandatory reductions on greenhouse
    gas emissions will create additional costs for the Canadian oil
    and gas industry, including us. Certain provinces in Canada also
    have implemented or are currently implementing legislation and
    regulations to report and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which
    also will carry a cost associated with compliance. Presently, it
    is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur
    to comply with any laws or regulations developed to achieve
    emissions reductions in Canada or elsewhere, but such
    expenditures could be substantial.

In 2006, we established our Corporate Climate Change Position
    and Strategy. Key components of the strategy include initiation
    of energy efficiency measures, tracking emerging climate change
    legislation and publication of a corporate greenhouse gas
    emission inventory. We last published our emission inventory on
    January 2008. We will publish another emission inventory on or
    before March 31, 2011 to comply with a reporting mandate
    issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
    Additionally, we continue to explore energy efficiency measures
    and greenhouse emission reduction opportunities. We also
    continue to monitor legislative and regulatory climate change
    developments, such as the proposals described above.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    5,400 employees. We consider labor relations with our
    employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages
    or strikes pertaining to our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in
    general, are subject to a variety of risks. If any of the
    following risk factors should occur, our profitability,
    financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted.
    As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of
    their investment in Devon.

Oil, Gas
    and NGL Prices are Volatile

Our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and
    demand for oil, gas and NGLs. A significant downward movement of
    the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse
    effect on our revenues, operating cash flows and profitability.
    Such a downward price movement could also have a material
    adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves, the carrying
    value of our oil and gas properties, the level of planned
    drilling activities and future growth. Historically, prices have
    been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the
    future due to numerous factors beyond our control. These factors
    include, but are not limited to:

•

consumer demand for oil, gas and NGLs;

•

conservation efforts;

•

OPEC production levels;

•

weather;

•

regional pricing differentials;

•

differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus
    heavy or sour crude) and Btu content of gas produced;

•

the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels;

•

the overall economic environment; and

•

governmental regulations and taxes.

Estimates
    of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
    geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir,
    particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of
    judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop
    different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue
    based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a
    given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result
    of several factors including additional development activity,
    the viability of production under varying economic conditions
    and variations in production levels and associated costs.
    Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates
    may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such
    revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse
    effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our
    financial condition and profitability.



Additional discussion of our policies and internal controls
    related to estimating and recording reserves is described in
    “Item 2. Properties — Preparation of
    Reserves Estimates and Reserves Audits.”

Discoveries
    or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a
    Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rates from oil and gas properties generally
    decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
    production costs generally increase, due to decreasing reservoir
    pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved
    reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline
    materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful
    exploration and development activities or, through engineering
    studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells,
    secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves, or
    acquire additional properties containing proved reserves.
    Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related
    per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of
    success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.

Future
    Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve
    Substantial Costs

Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire
    properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are
    subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not
    encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The
    costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In
    addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling
    operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions;

•

lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods;

•

environmental hazards or liabilities; and

•

shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery
    of equipment.

A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in
    a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular
    property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful
    in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an
    adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
    condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling
    activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves
    greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently performing
    exploratory drilling activities in certain international
    countries. We have been granted drilling concessions in these
    countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur
    capital expenditures. Even if future drilling activities are
    unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves, we will likely be
    required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital
    expenditures.

Industry
    Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be
    Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent
    oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases
    and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel
    required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
    is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs.
    Typically, during times of high or rising commodity prices,
    drilling and operating costs will also increase. Higher prices
    will also generally increase the costs of properties available
    for acquisition. Certain of our competitors have financial and
    other resources substantially



larger than ours. They also may have established strategic
    long-term positions and relationships in areas in which we may
    seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive
    disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many
    of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when
    responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas
    production, such as changing worldwide price and production
    levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the
    application of government regulations.

International
    Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic and Other
    Risks

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. As noted earlier in this report,
    we are in the process of divesting our operations outside North
    America. However, until we cease operating in these locations,
    we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties in
    these areas that are more prevalent than what exist for our
    operations in North America. Such factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency
    because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
    overall business and results of operations by distracting
    management’s attention from our more significant assets.
    Various regions of the world have a history of political and
    economic instability. This instability could result in new
    governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in
    a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment.
    In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of
    contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This
    could adversely affect our interests and our future
    profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

Public
    Policy, Which Includes Laws, Rules and Regulations, Can
    Change

Our operations are subject to federal laws, rules and
    regulations in the United States, Canada and the other countries
    in which we operate. In addition, we are also subject to the
    laws and regulations of various



states, provinces, tribal and local governments. Pursuant to
    public policy changes, numerous government departments and
    agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on
    the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of
    which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Changes
    in such public policy have affected, and at times in the future
    could affect, our operations. Political developments can
    restrict production levels, enact price controls, change
    environmental protection requirements, and increase taxes,
    royalties and other amounts payable to governments or
    governmental agencies. Although we are unable to predict changes
    to existing laws and regulations, such changes could
    significantly impact our profitability. While public policy can
    change at any time in the future, those laws and regulations
    outside North America to which we are subject generally include
    greater risk of unforeseen change.

Environmental
    Matters and Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal, local
    and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us
    for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from our operations in affected areas. Any future
    environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the
    environment are uncertain and will be governed by several
    factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.
    There is no assurance that changes in or additions to public
    policy regarding the protection of the environment will not have
    a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Insurance
    Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration, development, production and processing of oil, gas
    and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences
    such as hurricanes, blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well
    control. These occurrences can result in damage to or
    destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to
    persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment.
    We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in
    accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that
    management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against
    all operational risks is not available to us. Due to changes in
    the insurance marketplace following hurricanes in the Gulf of
    Mexico in recent years, we currently do not have coverage for
    any damage that may be caused by future named windstorms in the
    Gulf of Mexico.

Certain
    of Our Investments Are Subject To Risks That May Affect Their
    Liquidity and Value

To maximize earnings on available cash balances, we periodically
    invest in securities that we consider to be short-term in nature
    and generally available for short-term liquidity needs. During
    2007, we purchased asset-backed securities that have an auction
    rate reset feature (“auction rate securities”). Our
    auction rate securities generally have contractual maturities of
    more than 20 years. However, the underlying interest rates
    on our securities are scheduled to reset every seven to
    28 days. Therefore, when we bought these securities, they
    were generally priced and subsequently traded as short-term
    investments because of the interest rate reset feature. At
    December 31, 2009, our auction rate securities totaled
    $115 million.

Since February 8, 2008, we have experienced difficulty
    selling our securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism, which provided liquidity to these securities. An
    auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
    securities could not do so. The securities for which auctions
    have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned
    every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. Due to
    continued auction failures throughout 2009, we consider these
    investments to be long-term in nature and generally not
    available for short-term liquidity needs.

Our auction rate securities are rated AAA — the
    highest rating — by one or more rating agencies and
    are collateralized by student loans that are substantially
    guaranteed by the United States government. These investments
    are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest
    rate risks, which may be exacerbated by problems in the global
    credit markets, including but not limited to, U.S. subprime
    mortgage defaults and writedowns by major financial institutions
    due to deteriorating values of their asset portfolios. These and
    other related factors have affected various sectors of the
    financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. If



issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and
    their credit ratings deteriorate, our ability to liquidate these
    securities and fully recover the carrying value of our
    investment in the near term may be limited. Under such
    circumstances, we may record an impairment charge on these
    investments in the future.

Properties

Property
    Overview

Our oil and gas operations are concentrated in various North
    American onshore areas in the United States and Canada. We also
    have offshore operations that are situated principally in the
    Gulf of Mexico and regions located offshore Azerbaijan, Brazil
    and China. As previously mentioned, we are in the process of
    divesting our offshore assets. Our properties consist of
    interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and
    mineral acreage in these regions. These interests entitle us to
    drill for and produce oil, gas and NGLs from specific areas. Our
    interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a
    lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits
    interests, foreign government concessions and other forms of
    direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and
    NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant
    midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region
    in north Texas. These assets include approximately
    3,100 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants
    with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a
    15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To support our continued
    development and growing production in the Woodford Shale,
    located in southeastern Oklahoma, we constructed the Northridge
    natural gas processing plant in 2008. The Northridge plant has a
    capacity of 200 MMcf per day.

Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline
    transportation system in Canada. This

220-mile

dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in
    northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal near
    Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the
    Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the
    combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market for sale. We
    have a 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline.



The following sections provide additional details of our oil and
    gas properties, including information about proved reserves,
    production, wells, acreage and drilling activities.

U.S.
    Onshore

Barnett Shale

— The Barnett Shale, located in
    north Texas, is our largest property both in terms of production
    and proved reserves. Our leases include approximately
    663,000 net acres located primarily in Denton, Johnson,
    Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties. The Barnett Shale is a
    non-conventional reservoir and it produces natural gas and NGLs.
    We have an average working interest of 89%. We drilled
    336 gross wells in 2009 and plan to drill approximately
    370 gross wells in 2010.



Carthage

— The Carthage area in east Texas
    includes primarily Harrison, Marion, Panola and Shelby counties.
    Our average working interest is about 86% and we hold
    approximately 218,000 net acres. Our Carthage area wells
    produce primarily natural gas and NGLs from conventional
    reservoirs. We drilled 39 gross wells in 2009 and plan to
    drill approximately 30 gross wells in 2010.

Permian Basin, Texas

— Our oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of west Texas comprise
    approximately 850,000 net acres located across several
    counties in west Texas. These properties produce both oil and
    gas from conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest
    in these properties is about 40%. In 2009, we drilled
    80 gross wells and plan to drill approximately
    220 gross wells in 2010.

Washakie

— Our Washakie area leases are
    concentrated in Carbon and Sweetwater counties in southern
    Wyoming. Our average working interest is about 76% and we hold
    about 157,000 net acres in the area. The Washakie wells
    produce primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs. In
    2009, we drilled 94 gross wells and plan to drill
    approximately 115 gross wells in 2010.

Cana-Woodford Shale

— The Cana-Woodford Shale
    is located in Canadian, Blaine and Caddo counties in western
    Oklahoma. Our average working interest is approximately 46% and
    we hold approximately 117,000 net acres. Our Cana-Woodford
    Shale properties produce natural gas and NGLs from a
    non-conventional reservoir. We drilled 47 gross wells in
    2009 and plan to drill approximately 85 gross wells in
    2010. To support our growing production in the Cana-Woodford
    Shale, we are building a 200 MMcf per day natural gas
    processing facility. We expect to complete this facility in
    early 2011.

Arkoma-Woodford Shale

— Our Arkoma-Woodford
    Shale properties in southeastern Oklahoma produce natural gas
    and NGLs from a non-conventional reservoir. Our 58,000 net
    acres are concentrated in Coal and Hughes counties, and we have
    an average working interest of about 32%. In 2009, we drilled
    61 gross wells in this area and plan to drill approximately
    85 gross wells in 2010.

Groesbeck

— The Groesbeck area of east Texas
    includes portions of Freestone, Leon, Limestone and Robertson
    counties. Our average working interest is approximately 72% and
    we hold about 132,000 net acres of land. The Groesbeck
    wells produce primarily natural gas from conventional
    reservoirs. In 2009, we drilled 13 gross wells and plan to
    drill approximately 10 gross wells in 2010.

Haynesville Shale

— Our Haynesville Shale
    acreage spans across east Texas and north Louisiana with an
    average working interest of 92%. To date, our drilling activity
    has been focused on de-risking the 157,000 acres located in
    Panola, Shelby and San Augustine counties in east Texas. We
    drilled 8 gross wells in 2009 and plan to drill
    approximately 30 gross wells in 2010.

Canada

Jackfish

— Jackfish is our 100%-owned thermal
    heavy oil project in the non-conventional oil sands of east
    central Alberta. We are employing steam-assisted gravity
    drainage at Jackfish. In late 2009, Jackfish’s gross
    production reached 33.7 MBbls of oil per day. Gross peak
    production is expected to be 35 MBbls per day with a flat
    production profile for greater than 20 years. We are
    currently constructing the second phase of Jackfish and
    evaluating the potential for a third phase. The second and third
    phases of Jackfish are each expected to also eventually produce
    35 MBbls per day of heavy oil production.

Northwest

— The Northwest region includes
    acreage within west central Alberta and northeast British
    Columbia. We hold approximately 1.9 million net acres in
    the region, which produces primarily natural gas and NGLs from
    conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest in the
    area is approximately 73%. In 2009, we drilled 36 gross
    wells and plan to drill approximately 55 gross wells in
    2010.

Lloydminster

— Our Lloydminster properties are
    located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and
    western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by
    conventional means without steam injection. We hold
    2.5 million net acres and have an 89% average working
    interest in our Lloydminster properties. In 2009, we drilled
    239 gross wells and plan to drill approximately
    140 gross wells in 2010.

Deep Basin

— Our properties in Canada’s
    Deep Basin include portions of west central Alberta and east
    central British Columbia. We hold approximately 570,000 net
    acres in the Deep Basin. The area produces



primarily natural gas and natural gas liquids from conventional
    reservoirs. Our average working interest in the Deep Basin is
    45%. In 2009, we drilled 30 gross wells and plan to drill
    approximately 35 gross wells in 2010.

Horn River Basin

— The Horn River Basin,
    located in northeast British Columbia, is a non-conventional
    reservoir targeting the Devonian Shale. Our leases include
    approximately 170,000 net acres with a 100% working
    interest. We drilled 2 gross wells in 2009. During 2010, we
    plan to drill 11 gross wells, consisting of 7 horizontal
    wells and 4 vertical stratigraphic-test wells.

Preparation
    of Reserves Estimates and Reserves Audits

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas,
    which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
    estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically
    producible from known reservoirs under existing economic
    conditions, operating methods and government regulations. To be
    considered proved, oil and gas reserves must be economically
    producible before contracts providing the right to operate
    expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably
    certain. Also, the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have
    commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it
    will commence the project within a reasonable time.

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment as discussed in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As a result, we have
    developed internal policies for estimating and recording
    reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved
    reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
    guidance. Our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in
    reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the
    “Group”). These same policies also require that
    reserve estimates be made by professionally qualified reserves
    estimators (“Qualified Estimators”), as defined by the
    Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards.

The Group, which is led by Devon’s Director of Reserves and
    Economics, is responsible for the internal review and
    certification of reserves estimates. We ensure the Group’s
    Director and key members of the Group have appropriate technical
    qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates.
    Such qualifications include any or all of the following:

•

an undergraduate degree in petroleum engineering from an
    accredited university, or equivalent;

•

a petroleum engineering license, or similar certification;

•

memberships in oil and gas industry or trade groups; and

•

relevant experience estimating reserves.

The current Director of the Group and the Group’s key
    members all have the qualifications listed above. Additionally,
    the Group reports independently of any of our operating
    divisions. The Group’s Director reports to our Senior Vice
    President of Strategic Development, who reports to our
    President. No portion of the Group’s compensation is
    directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
    operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
    reserves that are audited include major fields and major
    additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group
    reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum
    consultants discussed below. The Group also ensures our
    Qualified Estimators obtain continuing education related to the
    fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.

The Group also oversees audits and reserves estimates performed
    by third-party consulting firms. During 2009, we engaged three
    such firms to both prepare and audit a significant portion of
    our proved reserves. Ryder Scott Company, L.P. prepared the 2009
    reserve estimates for all of our offshore Gulf of Mexico
    properties and for 99% of our International proved reserves.
    LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the 2009 reserve
    estimates for 93% of our domestic onshore properties. AJM
    Petroleum Consultants audited 91% of our Canadian reserves.



Set forth below is a summary of the North American reserves that
    were evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2009, 2008 and
    2007.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by our employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

In addition to conducting these internal and external reviews,
    we also have a Reserves Committee that consists of three
    independent members of our Board of Directors. Although we are
    not required to have a Reserves Committee, we established ours
    in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves
    estimation and certification process. The Reserves Committee was
    designed to assist the Board of Directors with its duties and
    responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved
    reserves, much like our Audit Committee assists the Board of
    Directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting
    requirements. Besides being independent, the members of our
    Reserves Committee also have educational backgrounds in geology
    or petroleum engineering, as well as experience relevant to the
    reserves estimation process.

The Reserves Committee meets at least twice a year to discuss
    reserves issues and policies, and periodically meets separately
    with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our
    independent petroleum consultants. The responsibilities of the
    Reserves Committee include the following:

•

perform an annual review and evaluation of our consolidated oil,
    gas and NGL reserves;

•

verify the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting
    system;

•

evaluate, prepare and disclose our compliance with legal and
    regulatory requirements related to our oil, gas and NGL reserves;

•

investigate and verify the qualifications and independence of
    our independent engineering consultants;

•

monitor the performance of our independent engineering
    consultants; and

•

monitor and evaluate our business practices and ethical
    standards in relation to the preparation and disclosure of
    reserves.

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the
    relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids
    reserves are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.

No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or
    included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental
    authority or agency since the beginning of 2009 except in
    filings with the SEC and the Department of Energy
    (“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC
    correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein.
    Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same
    underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates
    of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires
    reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we
    operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not
    operate.



Proved
    Developed Reserves

As presented in the previous table, we had 1,922 MMBoe of
    proved developed reserves at December 31, 2009. Proved
    developed reserves consist of proved developed producing
    reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The
    following table provides additional information regarding our
    proved developed reserves at December 31, 2009.

Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2009


During 2009, our proved undeveloped reserves increased 91%. A
    large contributor to the increase was our 2009 drilling
    activities, which increased our proved undeveloped reserves
    316 MMBoe. Also as a result of 2009 drilling activities, we
    converted 81 MMBoe, or 19%, of the 2008 proved undeveloped
    reserves to proved developed reserves.

Our proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2009 largely
    relate to our operations at Jackfish and the Barnett Shale.
    Additionally, the 2009 positive revisions due to prices largely
    related to Jackfish. At the end of 2008, none of our Jackfish
    reserves were classified as proved due to low oil prices.
    However, as oil prices rebounded during 2009, our Jackfish
    reserves, including the reserves that were undeveloped at the
    end of 2008, once again became economic and were classified as
    proved at the end of 2009. The positive revision related to
    Jackfish reserves was partially offset by decreases in proved
    undeveloped gas reserves related to certain of our North
    American Onshore properties.



At the end of 2009, approximately 1% of our proved reserves had
    been classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years.
    The majority of such reserves relate to our deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico operations where sanctioned development projects often
    take longer than five years to complete.

Proved
    Reserves Cash Flows

The following table presents estimated cash flow information
    related to our December 31, 2009 estimated proved reserves.
    Similar to reserves, the cash flow estimates correspond with the
    method used in presenting the “Supplemental Information on
    Oil and Gas Operations” in Note 22 to our consolidated
    financial statements included in this report.

Operation
    of Properties

The

day-to-day

operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of
    an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements.
    The operator supervises production, maintains production
    records, employs field personnel and performs other functions.

We are the operator of 24,221 of our wells. As operator, we
    receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
    performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing
    and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
    in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the
    monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
    administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.

Title to
    Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
    customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
    not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We
    believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the
    value of such properties or from the respective interests
    therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
    of the business.



As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
    of local records, little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
    Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of
    outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an
    acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of
    drilling operations on undeveloped properties.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental
    to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the date of
    this report, there were no material pending legal proceedings to
    which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject.

During 2009 and 2008, we recorded noncash reductions of carrying
    value of oil and gas properties totaling $6.4 billion
    ($4.1 billion after income taxes) and $9.9 billion
    ($6.7 billion after income taxes), respectively, related to
    our continuing operations as discussed in Note 15 of the
    consolidated financial statements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007 we
    recorded noncash reductions of carrying value of oil and gas
    properties totaling $108 million ($105 million after
    taxes), $494 million ($465 million after taxes) and
    $68 million ($13 million after taxes) related to our
    discontinued operations as discussed in Note 18 of the
    consolidated financial statements.

(2)

For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed
    charges and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and
    preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings
    from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed
    charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense and
    one-third of rental expense estimated to be attributable to
    interest; and (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of
    the amount of pre-tax earnings required to pay dividends on the
    preferred stock that was outstanding until June 2008.

For 2009, earnings from continuing operations were inadequate to
    cover fixed charges by $4.6 billion. For 2008, earnings
    from continuing operations were inadequate to cover fixed
    charges and combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends
    by $4.2 billion. These earnings relationships were
    primarily the result of the noncash reductions of the carrying
    values of certain oil and gas properties referred to above.

(3)

The amounts presented under “Production, Price and Other
    Data” exclude the amounts related to our discontinued
    international operations. The price data presented excludes the
    effects of unrealized and realized gains and losses from our oil
    and gas derivative financial instruments.

(4)

Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas
    per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy
    content of gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative
    of the relationship of gas and oil prices. NGL volumes are
    converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are
    affected by market and other factors in addition to relative
    energy content.

Overview
    of Business

Devon is one of North America’s leading independent oil and
    gas exploration and production companies. Our operations are
    focused in the United States and Canada. We also own natural gas
    pipelines and treatment facilities in many of our producing
    areas, making us one of North America’s larger processors
    of natural gas liquids.

As an enterprise, we strive to optimize value for our
    shareholders by growing reserves, production, earnings and cash
    flows, all on a per share basis. We accomplish this by
    replenishing our reserves and production and managing other key
    operational elements that drive our success. These items are
    discussed more fully below.

•

Reserves and production growth

— Our financial
    condition and profitability are significantly affected by the
    amount of proved reserves we own. Oil and gas properties are our
    most significant assets, and the reserves that relate to such
    properties are key to our future success. To increase our proved
    reserves, we must replace quantities produced with additional
    reserves from successful exploration and development activities
    or property acquisitions. Additionally, our profitability and
    operating cash flows are largely dependent on the amount of oil,
    gas and NGLs we produce. Growing production from existing
    properties is difficult because the rate of production from oil
    and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.
    As a result, we constantly drill for and develop reserves on
    properties that provide a balance of near-term and long-term
    production. In addition, we may acquire properties with proved
    reserves that we can develop and subsequently produce to help us
    meet our production goals.

•

Capital investment discipline

— Effectively
    deploying our resources into capital projects is key to
    maintaining and growing future production and oil and gas
    reserves. As a result, we have historically deployed virtually
    all our available cash flow into capital projects. Therefore,
    maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in capital
    projects is important to our profitability and financial
    condition. Our ability to control capital expenditures can be
    affected by changes in commodity prices. During times of high
    commodity prices, drilling and related costs often escalate due
    to the effects of supply versus demand economics. The inverse is
    also true.

Approximately two-thirds of our planned 2010 investment in
    capital projects is dedicated to a foundation of low-risk
    projects in our North American Onshore properties. The remainder
    of our capital has been identified for longer-term projects
    primarily in new unconventional natural gas plays in several
    U.S. Onshore regions, as well as offshore activities in the
    Gulf of Mexico. By deploying our capital in this manner, we are
    able to consistently deliver cost-efficient drill-bit growth and
    provide a strong source of cash flow while balancing short-term
    and long-term growth targets. The timing of closing the planned
    sales of our Gulf of Mexico properties will impact exactly how
    much of our 2010 capital is used on our Gulf of Mexico assets.

•

High margin assets

— Like many investors, we
    seek to invest our capital resources into projects where we can
    generate the highest risk-adjusted investment returns. One
    factor that can have a significant impact on such returns is our
    drilling success rates. Combined with appropriate revenue and
    cost-management strategies, high drilling success rates are
    important to generating competitive returns on our capital
    investment. During 2009, we drilled 1,135 wells and 99% of
    those were successful. The success rate is similar to our
    drilling achievements in recent years, demonstrating a proven
    track record of success. By accomplishing high drilling success
    rates, we provide an inventory of reserves growth and a platform
    of opportunities on our undrilled acreage that can be profitably
    developed.

•

Reserves and production balance

— As evidenced
    by history, commodity prices are inherently volatile. In
    addition, oil and gas prices often diverge due to a variety of
    circumstances. Consequently, we value a balance of reserves and
    production between gas and liquids that can add stability to our
    revenue stream when either commodity price is under pressure.
    Our production mix in 2009 was



approximately 70% gas and 30% oil and NGLs such as propane,
    butane and ethane. Our year-end reserves were approximately 60%
    gas and 40% liquids. With planned future growth in oil from our
    Jackfish and other projects, combined with an inventory of shale
    natural gas plays, we expect to maintain this balance in the
    future.

•

Operating cost controls

— To maintain our
    competitive position, we must control our lease operating costs
    and other production costs. As reservoirs are depleted and
    production rates decline, per unit production costs will
    generally increase and affect our profitability and operating
    cash flows. Similar to capital expenditures, our ability to
    control operating costs can be affected by significant changes
    in commodity prices. Our base North American production is
    focused in core areas of our operations where we can achieve
    economies of scale to help manage our operating costs.

•

Marketing and midstream performance improvement

— We enhance the value of our oil and gas
    operations with our marketing and midstream business. By
    efficiently gathering and processing oil, gas and NGL
    production, our midstream operations contribute to our
    strategies to grow reserves and production and manage
    expenditures. Additionally, by effectively marketing our
    production, we maximize the prices received for our oil, gas and
    NGL production in relation to market prices. This is important
    because our profitability is highly dependent on market prices.
    These prices are determined primarily by market conditions.
    Market conditions for these products have been, and will
    continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide economic
    activity, weather and other factors that are beyond our control.
    To manage this volatility, we utilize financial hedging
    arrangements and fixed-price physical delivery contracts. As of
    February 15, 2010, approximately 53% of our 2010 gas
    production is associated with financial price swaps and collars.
    Additionally, approximately 65% of our 2010 oil production is
    associated with financial price collars.

•

Financial flexibility preservation

— As
    mentioned, commodity prices have been and will continue to be
    volatile and will continue to impact our profitability and cash
    flow. We understand this fact and manage our debt levels
    accordingly to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility.
    We generally operate within the cash flow generated by our
    operations. However, during periods of low commodity prices, we
    may use our balance sheet strength to access debt or equity
    markets, allowing us to preserve our business and maintain
    momentum until markets recover. When prices improve, we can
    utilize excess operating cash flow to repay debt and invest in
    our activities that not only maintain but also increase value
    per share.

Overview
    of 2009 Results

2009 was a pivotal year for us as we began repositioning
    Devon to focus entirely on our high-return, North American
    Onshore natural gas and oil portfolio. We grew North American
    Onshore production more than six percent in 2009 and replaced
    more than twice our production with the drill bit at very
    attractive costs. The performance of these assets is reflected
    in our earnings, which steadily increased over the last three
    quarters of 2009.

However, our full year 2009 results were significantly impacted
    by the downward pressure in oil and natural gas prices that
    began in the last half of 2008 and continued throughout 2009.
    The Henry Hub natural gas index average for 2009 was 56% lower
    than 2008. Although crude prices have improved since the end of
    2008, the 2009 West Texas Intermediate oil index average
    was 38% lower than 2008.

The lower oil and gas prices significantly impacted our first
    quarter 2009 earnings, which in turn impacted our full year
    earnings. During 2009, we incurred a net loss of
    $2.5 billion, or $5.58 per diluted share. These amounts are
    the result of a noncash impairment of our oil and gas properties
    that was recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and totaled
    $4.2 billion, net of income taxes. Substantially all of
    this noncash charge was the result of the drop in natural gas
    prices during the first quarter of 2009.

Key measures of our performance for 2009, as well as certain
    operational developments, are summarized below:

•

Production grew 4% over 2008, to 233 million Boe.



•

The combined realized price for oil, gas and NGLs per Boe
    decreased 50% to $26.15.

•

Oil and gas hedges generated net gains of $384 million in
    2009, including cash receipts of $505 million.

•

Marketing and midstream operating profit decreased 25% to
    $512 million.

•

Per unit lease operating costs decreased 14% to $7.16 per Boe.

•

Operating cash flow decreased to $4.7 billion, representing
    a 50% decrease over 2008.

•

Capitalized costs incurred in our oil and gas activities were
    $4.1 billion in 2009.

From an operational perspective, we completed another successful
    year with the drill-bit. We drilled 1,135 gross wells with
    an overall 99% rate of success. This success rate enabled us to
    increase proved reserves by 496 million Boe, which was more
    than double our 2009 production. Our drilling success was driven
    by North American Onshore development wells, which represented
    95% of the wells drilled.

Besides another successful year of North American Onshore
    drilling, we had several other key operational achievements
    during 2009. The first phase of our 100%-owned Jackfish thermal
    heavy oil project in the Alberta oil sands was operational
    throughout 2009. As measured by production per well and

steam-to-oil

ratio, Jackfish is one of Canada’s most successful
    steam-assisted gravity drainage projects. In late 2009,
    Jackfish’s gross production reached 33.7 MBbls of oil
    per day. The addition of four more producing wells is expected
    to push production to the facility’s capacity of
    35 MBbls per day in early 2010.

We continued construction throughout 2009 on a second phase of
    the Jackfish project. Jackfish 2 is also sized to produce
    35 MBbls of oil per day and will commence operations in
    2011. Further expansion into a third phase of Jackfish is
    planned for 2010. We expect to file a regulatory application for
    Jackfish 3 in the third quarter of 2010.

Elsewhere in North America, we are expanding and developing five
    natural gas shale plays where we own a total of 1.6 million
    net acres. At the Barnett Shale, the most mature of our shale
    plays, we pushed our total producing wells to almost 4,200 at
    the end of 2009, and we exited the year producing just over one
    Bcfe per day. In the Cana-Woodford Shale and Arkoma-Woodford
    Shale, we drilled a total of 108 wells, increasing reserves
    to 120 MMBoe. In the Haynesville Shale, our drilling has
    been focused on de-risking our acreage in the greater Carthage
    area of east Texas. Finally, at Horn River, we have assembled a
    portfolio of acreage that requires minimal drilling to hold. We
    are in the early stages of evaluating the full potential of
    these leases and formulating a development plan.

Even with the net loss, we maintained a solid financial position
    throughout 2009. We used operating cash flow, borrowings and
    cash on hand to fund $5.3 billion of capital expenditures
    and pay $284 million of dividends. At the end of 2009, we
    had $1.0 billion of cash and $1.8 billion of
    availability under our credit lines.

Business
    and Industry Outlook

Over the past decade we captured an abundance of resources. We
    pioneered horizontal drilling in the Barnett Shale field in
    north Texas and extended this technique to other natural gas
    shale plays in the United States and Canada. We became
    proficient with steam-assisted gravity drainage with our
    Jackfish oil sands development in Alberta, Canada. We achieved
    key oil discoveries with our drilling in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico and offshore Brazil. We have more than tripled our proved
    oil and gas reserves since 2000 and have also assembled an
    extensive inventory of exploration assets, representing
    additional unproved resources.

Building off our past successes, in November 2009, we announced
    plans to strategically reposition Devon as a high-growth, North
    American onshore exploration and production company. As part of
    this strategic repositioning, we plan to bring forward the value
    of our offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and
    countries outside North America by divesting them.



This repositioning is driven by our desire to unlock and
    accelerate the realization of the value underlying the deep
    inventory of opportunities we have. We have assembled a valuable
    portfolio of offshore assets, and we have a considerable
    inventory of premier North American onshore assets. However, our
    North American Onshore assets have consistently provided us our
    highest risk-adjusted investment returns. By selling our
    offshore assets, we can more aggressively pursue the untapped
    value of these North American Onshore opportunities.

We expect to receive after-tax proceeds of between
    $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion as we divest our
    U.S. Offshore and International properties in 2010. By
    using a portion of these proceeds to reduce debt, we will
    further strengthen our balance sheet. Besides reducing debt, the
    offshore divestiture proceeds are expected to provide
    significant funds to redeploy into our prolific North American
    Onshore opportunities. With these added funds, we plan to
    accelerate the growth and realization of the value of our North
    American Onshore assets.

Results
    of Operations

As previously stated, we are in the process of divesting our
    offshore assets. As a result, all amounts in this document
    related to our International operations are presented as
    discontinued. Therefore, the production, revenue and expense
    amounts presented in this “Results of Operations”
    section exclude amounts related to our International assets
    unless otherwise noted. Even though we are also divesting our
    U.S. Offshore operations, these properties do not qualify
    as discontinued operations under accounting rules. As such,
    financial and operating data provided in this document that
    pertain to our continuing operations include amounts related to
    our U.S. Offshore operations. To facilitate comparisons of
    our ongoing operations subsequent to the planned divestitures,
    we have presented amounts related to our U.S. Offshore
    assets separate from those of our North American Onshore assets
    where appropriate.

Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts are expressed in
    U.S. dollars.

Oil
    Sales

2009 vs. 2008

Oil sales decreased $1.3 billion as a
    result of a 38% decrease in our realized price without hedges.
    The average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate index price decreased
    38% during the same time period, accounting for the majority of
    the decrease in our realized price.

Oil sales increased $258 million due to a three million
    barrel, or 8%, increase in production. The increased production
    resulted primarily from the continued development of our
    Jackfish thermal heavy oil project in Canada.

2008 vs. 2007

Oil sales increased $894 million as a
    result of a 38% increase in our realized price without hedges.
    The average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate index price increased
    38% during the same time period, accounting for the majority of
    the increase in our realized price.

Oil sales increased $222 million due to a four million
    barrel, or 10%, increase in production. Production from our
    Canadian operations increased approximately six million barrels
    in 2008 as a result of first oil sales



at Jackfish and heavy oil development activity at Lloydminster.
    This increase was partially offset by the deferral of
    0.5 million barrels of oil production from our
    U.S. Offshore properties due to hurricanes.

Gas
    Sales

2009 vs. 2008

Gas sales decreased $4.3 billion as a
    result of a 57% decrease in our realized price without hedges.
    This decrease was largely due to decreases in the North American
    regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.

A 28 Bcf, or 3%, increase in production during 2009 caused
    gas sales to increase by $222 million. Our North American
    Onshore properties contributed 40 Bcf of higher volumes.
    This increase included 25 Bcf of higher production in
    Canada due to a decline in Canadian government royalties,
    resulting largely from lower gas prices. The remainder of the
    North American Onshore growth resulted from new drilling and
    development that exceeded natural production declines, primarily
    in the Barnett Shale field in north Texas. These increases were
    partially offset by 12 Bcf of lower production from our
    U.S. Offshore properties, largely resulting from natural
    production declines.

2008 vs. 2007

Gas sales increased $1.6 billion as a
    result of a 29% increase in our realized price without hedges.
    This increase was largely due to increases in the North American
    regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.

A 76 Bcf, or 9%, increase in production during 2008 caused
    gas sales to increase by $459 million. Our North American
    Onshore properties contributed 96 Bcf to our growth as a
    result of new drilling and development that exceeded natural
    production declines. This increase was led by our drilling and
    development program in the Barnett Shale, which contributed
    83 Bcf to the gas production increase. This increase and
    the effect of new drilling and development in our other North
    American Onshore properties were partially offset by natural
    production declines and the deferral of seven Bcf of production
    in our U.S. Offshore properties in 2008 due to hurricanes.

NGL
    Sales

2009 vs. 2008

NGL sales decreased $585 million as a
    result of a 44% decrease in our realized price without hedges.
    This decrease was largely due to decreases in the regional index
    prices upon which our U.S. Onshore NGL sales are based. NGL
    sales increased $89 million in 2009 due to a two million
    barrel, or 7%, increase in production. The increase in
    production is primarily due to drilling and development in the
    Barnett Shale.

2008 vs. 2007

NGL sales increased $178 million as a
    result of a 17% increase in our realized price without hedges.
    This increase was largely due to increases in the regional index
    prices upon which our U.S. Onshore NGL sales are based. NGL
    sales increased $95 million in 2008 due to a two million
    barrel, or 10%, increase in production. The increase in
    production is primarily due to Barnett Shale drilling and
    development.

Our oil and gas derivative financial instruments include price
    swaps, basis swaps and costless price collars. For the price
    swaps, we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a
    variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the
    basis swaps, we receive a fixed differential between two
    regional gas index prices and pay a variable differential on the
    same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The price
    collars set a floor and ceiling price. If the applicable monthly
    price indices are outside of the ranges set by the



floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, we cash-settle
    the difference with the counterparty to the collars. Cash
    settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized
    gains or losses related to our price swaps and collars.

In addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects, we
    also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil
    and gas derivative instruments in each reporting period. We
    estimate the fair values of our oil and gas derivative financial
    instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow
    calculations. We periodically validate our valuation techniques
    by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with
    those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers.

The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is
    our estimate of future commodity prices. We base our estimate of
    future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such
    as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments
    and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil
    instruments. Based on the amount of volumes subject to our gas
    price swaps and collars at December 31, 2009, a 10%
    increase in these forward curves would have increased our 2009
    unrealized losses for our gas derivative financial instruments
    by approximately $264 million. A 10% increase in the
    forward curves associated with our oil derivative financial
    instruments would have increased our 2009 unrealized losses by
    approximately $108 million. Another key input to our cash
    flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these
    forward curves, which we base primarily upon implied volatility.

Counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity
    derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any
    single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties.
    Our commodity derivative contracts are held with twelve separate
    counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally
    require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the
    counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade.
    The

mark-to-market

exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted,
    decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment
    grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to
    $50 million for the majority of our contracts. As of
    December 31, 2009, the credit ratings of all our
    counterparties were investment grade.

During 2009, the fair value of our oil and gas derivative
    financial instruments dropped by $121 million. This
    reduction largely resulted from the reversal of previously
    recorded unrealized gains on our gas price collar contracts,
    which was expected as the contracts settled throughout 2009 and
    expired on December 31, 2009. This reduction, as well as
    the reduction related to our oil price collars, were partially
    offset by unrealized gains on gas swap contracts that we entered
    into during 2009 and will be settled throughout 2010.

During 2008, the fair value of our gas derivative financial
    instruments increased by $243 million, which was largely
    due to a decrease in the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve.

    pipeline throughput.

2008 vs. 2007

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
    $556 million and operating costs and expenses increased

All percentage changes included in this table are based on
    actual figures and not the rounded figures included in this
    table.

2009 vs. 2008

LOE decreased $181 million in 2009.
    LOE dropped $182 million due to declining costs for fuel,
    materials, equipment and personnel, as well as declines in
    maintenance and well workover projects. Such declines largely
    resulted from decreasing demand for field services due to lower
    oil and gas prices. Changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. and Canadian dollar reduced LOE $49 million.
    Additionally, LOE decreased $31 million as a result of
    hurricane damages in 2008 to certain of our U.S. Offshore
    facilities and transportation systems. These factors were also
    the main contributors to the decrease in LOE per Boe on our
    North American Onshore properties. Production growth at our
    large-scale Jackfish project also contributed to a decrease in
    LOE per Boe. As Jackfish production approached the
    facility’s capacity during 2009, its

per-unit

costs declined, contributing to lower overall LOE per Boe. The
    remainder of our 4% production growth added $81 million to
    LOE during 2009.

2008 vs. 2007

LOE increased $319 million in 2008.
    The largest individual contributor to this increase, as well as
    the increase in LOE per Boe, was higher

per-unit

costs associated with the new thermal heavy oil production at
    Jackfish in 2008. When large-scale projects such as Jackfish are
    in the early phases of production,

per-unit

operating costs are normally higher than the

per-unit

costs for our overall portfolio of producing properties. LOE
    also increased $144 million due to our 9% growth in
    production. Additionally, LOE increased $31 million due to
    hurricane damages in 2008 to certain of our U.S. Offshore
    facilities and transportation systems. These hurricane damages
    also contributed to the increase in LOE per Boe.



Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes primarily consist of production
    taxes and ad valorem taxes assessed by various government
    agencies on our U.S. Onshore properties. Production taxes
    are based on a percentage of production revenues that varies by
    property and government jurisdiction. Ad valorem taxes generally
    are based on property values as determined by the government
    agency assessing the tax. The following table details the
    changes in our taxes other than income taxes between 2007 and
    2009.

    table.

2009 vs. 2008

Production taxes decreased
    $174 million in 2009. This decrease was largely due to
    lower U.S. Onshore revenues, as well as an increase in tax
    credits associated with certain properties in the state of
    Texas. Ad valorem taxes increased $13 million primarily due
    to higher assessed oil and gas property and equipment values.

2008 vs. 2007

Production taxes increased $90 million
    in 2008 primarily due to an increase in our U.S. Onshore
    revenues. Ad valorem taxes increased $27 million primarily
    due to higher assessed oil and gas property and equipment values.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties
    (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying
    the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during
    the year, by the “depletable base.” The depletable
    base represents our capitalized investment, net of accumulated
    DD&A and reductions of carrying value, plus future
    development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves.
    Generally, when reserve volumes are revised up or down, then the
    DD&A rate per unit of production will change inversely.
    However, when the depletable base changes, then the DD&A
    rate moves in the same direction. The per unit DD&A rate is
    not affected by production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A,
    as opposed to the rate per unit of production, generally moves
    in the same direction as production volumes. Oil and gas
    property DD&A is calculated separately on a

country-by-country

basis.

The changes in our production volumes, DD&A rate per unit
    and DD&A of oil and gas properties between 2007 and 2009
    are shown in the table below.

2009 DD&A

$

1,832

2009 vs. 2008

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    decreased $1.2 billion due to a 40% decrease in the
    DD&A rate. The largest contributors to the rate decrease
    were reductions of the carrying values of certain of our oil and
    gas properties recognized in the first quarter of 2009 and the
    fourth quarter of 2008. These reductions totaled
    $16.3 billion and resulted from full cost ceiling
    limitations in the United States and Canada. In addition, the
    effects of changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. and Canadian dollar also contributed to the rate
    decrease. These factors were partially offset by the effects of
    costs incurred and the transfer of previously unproved costs to
    the depletable base as a result of 2009 drilling activities.
    Partially offsetting the impact from the lower 2009 DD&A
    rate was our 4% production increase, which caused oil and gas
    property related DD&A expense to increase $130 million.

Our 2009 DD&A rate reflects our adoption of the SEC’s

Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

. The impact of
    adopting the SEC’s new rules at the end of 2009 had
    virtually no impact on our 2009 DD&A rate.

2008 vs. 2007

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    increased $312 million due to a 12% increase in the
    DD&A rate. The largest contributor to the rate increase was
    inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2008 as
    well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future
    periods on proved undeveloped reserves. Other factors that
    contributed to the rate increase were reductions in reserve
    estimates due to lower 2008 year-end commodity prices and
    the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base
    as a result of 2008 drilling activities. In addition to the
    impact from the higher 2008 rate, the 9% production increase
    caused oil and gas property related DD&A expense to
    increase $224 million.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our net G&A consists of three primary components. The
    largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses
    incurred for personnel costs, office expenses, professional fees
    and other G&A items. The gross amount of these expenses is
    partially offset by two components. One is the amount of
    G&A capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of
    accounting related to exploration and development activities.
    The other is the amount of G&A reimbursed by working
    interest owners of properties for which we serve as the
    operator. These reimbursements are received during both the
    drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. The
    gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts capitalized
    and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the consolidated
    statements of operations. Net G&A includes expenses related
    to oil, gas and NGL exploration



and production activities, as well as marketing and midstream
    activities. See the following table for a summary of G&A
    expenses by component.

All percentage changes included in this table are based on
    actual figures and not the rounded figures included in this
    table.

2009 vs. 2008

Gross G&A increased $4 million.
    This increase was due to approximately $60 million of
    higher costs for employee compensation and benefits, mostly
    offset by the effects of our 2009 reduced spending initiatives
    for certain discretionary cost categories.

Employee cost increases in 2009 included an additional
    $57 million of severance costs. This increase was primarily
    due to Gulf of Mexico employees that were impacted by the
    integration of our Gulf of Mexico and International operations
    into one offshore unit in the second quarter of 2009 and other
    employee departures during 2009. Additionally, postretirement
    benefits costs increased approximately $50 million. The
    increases in employee costs were partially offset by a
    $27 million decrease due to accelerated share-based
    compensation expense recognized in 2008 as discussed below.

2008 vs. 2007

Gross G&A increased $200 million.
    The largest contributors to the increase were higher employee
    compensation and benefits costs. These cost increases, which
    were largely related to our growth and industry inflation during
    most of 2008, caused gross G&A to increase
    $164 million. Of this increase, $65 million related to
    higher stock compensation.

Stock compensation increased $43 million in 2008 due to a
    modification of the share-based compensation arrangements for
    certain executives. The modified compensation arrangements
    provide that executives who meet certain

years-of-service

and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding
    share-based grants. As a condition to receiving the benefits of
    these modifications, the executives must agree not to use or
    disclose Devon’s confidential information and not to
    solicit Devon’s employees and customers. The executives are
    required to agree to these conditions at retirement and again in
    each subsequent year until all grants have vested.

Although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of
    the executives’ grants, it does accelerate the expense
    recognition as executives approach the

years-of-service

and age criteria. When the modification was made in 2008,
    certain executives had already met the

years-of-service

and age criteria. As a result, we recognized $27 million of
    share-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2008
    related to this modification. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    recognized an additional $16 million of stock compensation
    for grants made to these executives. The additional expenses
    would have been recognized in future reporting periods if the
    modification had not been made and the executives continued
    their employment at Devon.

The higher employee compensation and benefits costs, exclusive
    of the accelerated stock compensation expense, were also the
    primary factors that caused the $60 million increase in
    capitalized G&A in 2008.

Restructuring
    Costs

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized $153 million
    of estimated employee severance costs associated with the
    planned divestitures of our offshore assets that was announced
    in November 2009. This amount was based on our estimates of the
    number of employees that will ultimately be impacted by the
    divestitures, and includes $63 million related to
    accelerated vesting of share-based grants. Of the
    $153 million



total, $105 million relates to our U.S. Offshore
    operations and the remainder relates to our International
    discontinued operations.

As of the date of this report, only one of the properties we
    intend to sell had actually been sold. Furthermore, the vast
    majority of employees will not be impacted by the divestitures
    until the properties are sold. Therefore, our estimate of
    employee severance costs recognized in the fourth quarter of
    2009 was based upon certain key estimates that could change as
    properties are sold. These estimates include the number of
    impacted employees, the number of employees offered comparable
    positions with the buyers and the date of separation for
    impacted employees. If our estimate of the number of impacted
    employees were to increase 10%, our estimate of employee
    severance costs would increase approximately $10 million.
    If our estimate of the number of employees offered comparable
    positions with the buyers were to decrease by 10%, our estimate
    of employee severance costs would increase approximately
    $15 million. Additionally, if the date of separation were
    to occur one month after our current estimates, our estimate of
    employee severance costs would increase approximately
    $2 million.

2009 vs. 2008

Interest based on debt outstanding
    increased $11 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was
    primarily due to interest paid on the $500 million of
    5.625% senior unsecured notes and $700 million of
    6.30% senior unsecured notes that we issued in January
    2009. This was partially offset by lower interest resulting from
    the retirement of our exchangeable debentures during the third
    quarter of 2008 and lower interest rates on our floating-rate
    commercial paper borrowings.

Capitalized interest decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due
    to the sales of our West African exploration and development
    properties in 2008 and the completion of the Access pipeline
    transportation system in Canada in the second quarter of 2008.

2008 vs. 2007

Interest based on debt outstanding
    decreased $82 million from 2007 to 2008. This decrease was
    largely due to lower average outstanding amounts for commercial
    paper and credit facility borrowings in 2008 than in 2007. The
    decrease in borrowings resulted largely from the use of proceeds
    from our West African divestiture program and cash flow from
    operations to repay all commercial paper and credit facility
    borrowings in the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, we
    retired debentures with a face value of $652 million during
    2008, primarily during the third quarter.

Capitalized interest increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due
    to higher cumulative costs related to large-scale development
    projects in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by lower
    capitalized interest resulting from the completion of the Access
    pipeline in the second quarter of 2008.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

We recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our
    interest rate swaps each reporting period. We estimate the fair
    values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily
    by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon
    forward interest-rate yields. We periodically validate our
    valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair
    value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties
    or brokers. In 2009 and 2008, we recorded unrealized gains of
    $66 million and $104 million, respectively, as a
    result of changes in interest rates. Also, during 2009 and 2008,
    we received cash settlements totaling $40 million and
    $1 million, respectively, from counterparties to settle our
    interest rate swaps. There were no cash settlements in 2007.

The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is
    our estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our
    estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that
    utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds
    Rate provided by a third party. Based on the notional amount
    subject to the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2009, a
    10% increase in these forward curves would have increased our
    2009 unrealized gain for our interest rate swaps by
    approximately $46 million.

Similar to our commodity derivative contracts, counterparty
    credit risk is also a component of interest rate derivative
    valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any single
    counterparty by contracting with several counterparties. Our
    interest rate derivative contracts are held with seven separate
    counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally
    require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the
    counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade.
    The

mark-to-market

exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted,
    decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment
    grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to
    $50 million for the majority of our contracts. The credit
    ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of
    December 31, 2009.

Chevron
    Common Stock and Related Embedded Option

Until October 31, 2008, we owned 14.2 million shares
    of Chevron common stock and recognized unrealized changes in the
    fair value of this investment. On October 31, 2008, we
    exchanged these shares of Chevron common stock for
    Chevron’s interest in the Drunkard’s Wash properties
    located in east-central Utah and $280 million in cash. In
    accordance with the terms of the exchange, the fair value of our
    investment in the Chevron shares was estimated to be $67.71 per
    share on the exchange date. Prior to the exchange of these
    shares, we calculated the fair value of our investment in
    Chevron common stock using Chevron’s published market price.

We also recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of the
    conversion option embedded in the debentures exchangeable into
    shares of Chevron common stock. The embedded option was not
    actively traded in an established market. Therefore, we
    estimated its fair value using quotes obtained from a broker for
    trades occurring near the valuation date.



The loss during 2008 on our investment in Chevron common stock
    was directly attributable to a $25.62 per share decrease in the
    estimated fair value while we owned Chevron’s common stock
    during the year. The gain on the embedded option during 2008 was
    directly attributable to the change in fair value of the Chevron
    common stock from January 1, 2008 to the maturity date of
    August 15, 2008. The gain on our investment in Chevron
    common stock and loss on the embedded option during 2007 were
    directly attributable to a $19.80 increase in the price per
    share of Chevron’s common stock during 2007.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2009 and 2008, we reduced the carrying values of certain
    of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations. A summary of these reductions and additional
    discussion is provided below.

The 2009 reduction was recognized in the first quarter and the
    2008 reductions were recognized in the fourth quarter. The
    reductions resulted from significant decreases in each
    country’s full cost ceiling compared to the immediately
    preceding quarter. The lower United States ceiling value in the
    first quarter of 2009 largely resulted from the effects of
    declining natural gas prices subsequent to December 31,
    2008. The lower ceiling values in the fourth quarter of 2008
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil, gas
    and NGL prices compared to September 30, 2008.

To demonstrate these declines, the March 31, 2009,
    December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2008 weighted

Interest and dividend income decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to
    a decrease in dividends received on our previously owned
    investment in Chevron common stock and a decrease in interest
    received on cash equivalents due to lower rates and balances.
    Interest and dividend income increased from 2007 to 2008
    primarily due to higher cash balances partially offset by lower
    interest rates and a decrease in dividends received on our
    investment in Chevron common stock.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act. The intent of this legislation was to
    encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico by
    providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain
    federal leases. Deep water leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) have contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or gas
    exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty relief would
    not be granted for that year.

In October 2007, a federal district court ruled in favor of a
    plaintiff who had challenged the legality of including price
    thresholds in deep water leases. Additionally, in January 2009 a
    federal appellate court upheld this district court ruling. This
    judgment was later appealed to the United States Supreme Court,
    which, in October 2009, declined to review the appellate
    court’s ruling. The Supreme Court’s decision ended the
    MMS’s judicial course to enforce the price thresholds.

Prior to September 30, 2009, we had $84 million
    accrued for potential royalties on various deep water leases.
    Based upon the Supreme Court’s decision, we reduced to zero
    the $84 million loss contingency accrual in the third
    quarter of 2009.

In 2008, we recognized $162 million of excess insurance
    recoveries for damages suffered in 2005 related to hurricanes
    that struck the Gulf of Mexico. The excess recoveries resulted
    from business interruption claims on policies that were in
    effect when the 2005 hurricanes occurred.

For 2008, our effective income tax rate differed from the
    U.S. statutory income tax rate largely due to two related
    factors. First, during 2008, we repatriated $2.6 billion
    from certain foreign subsidiaries to the United States. Second,
    we made certain tax policy election changes in the second
    quarter of 2008 to minimize the taxes we otherwise would pay for
    the cash repatriations, as well as the taxable gains associated
    with the sales of assets in West Africa. As a result of the
    repatriation and tax policy election changes, we recognized
    additional tax expense of $312 million during 2008. Of the
    $312 million, $295 million was recognized as current
    income tax expense, and $17 million was recognized as
    deferred tax expense. Excluding the $312 million of
    additional tax expense, our effective income tax benefit rate
    would have been 34% for 2008.

In 2007, deferred income taxes were reduced $261 million
    due to a Canadian statutory rate reduction that was enacted in
    that year.

Earnings
    From Discontinued Operations

For all years presented in the following tables, our
    discontinued operations include amounts related to our assets in
    Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and other minor International

2009 vs. 2008

Earnings from discontinued operations
    decreased $617 million in 2009. Our discontinued earnings
    were impacted by several factors. First, operating revenues
    declined largely due to a 36% decrease in the price realized on
    our production, which was driven by a decline in crude oil index
    prices. Second, both operating revenues and expenses declined
    due to divestitures that closed in 2008. Discontinued earnings
    also decreased due to $48 million of restructuring costs
    that relate to our planned divestitures and were recognized in
    the fourth quarter of 2009. These costs consist of employee
    severance costs. Earnings also decreased $752 million in
    2009 due to larger gains recognized on West African asset
    divestitures in 2008.

Partially offsetting these decreased earnings in 2009 was the
    larger reduction of carrying value recognized in 2008 compared
    to 2009. The reductions largely consisted of full cost ceiling
    limitations related to our assets in Brazil that were caused by
    a decline in oil prices.

2008 vs. 2007

Earnings from discontinued operations
    decreased $230 million in 2008. Our earnings were impacted
    by several factors. First, operating revenues and expenses,
    including the related production volumes, decreased largely due
    to the timing of our 2008 and 2007 divestitures, partially
    offset by the effects of first production in Brazil.
    Discontinued earnings also decreased due to the net effect of
    reductions in carrying value recognized in 2008 and 2007, which
    largely related to our assets in Brazil. Discontinued earnings
    increased $679 million in 2008 due to the larger African
    divestiture gains in 2008.

Operating
    Cash Flow — Continuing Operations

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flow”) continued to be our primary source of capital and
    liquidity in 2009. Changes in operating cash flow from our
    continuing operations are largely due to the same factors that
    affect our net earnings, with the exception of those earnings
    changes due to such noncash expenses as DD&A, financial
    instrument fair value changes, property impairments and deferred
    income taxes. As a result, our operating cash flow decreased 50%
    during 2009 primarily due to the significant decrease in oil,
    gas and NGL sales, net of commodity hedge settlements, as
    discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of
    this report.

During 2009, our operating cash flow funded approximately 87% of
    our cash payments for capital expenditures. Commercial paper
    borrowings were used to fund the remainder of our cash-based
    capital expenditures. During 2008 and 2007 our capital
    expenditures were primarily funded by our operating cash flow
    and pre-existing cash balances.

Other
    Sources of Cash — Continuing and Discontinued
    Operations

As needed, we supplement our operating cash flow with cash on
    hand and access to our available credit under our credit
    facilities and commercial paper program. We may also issue
    long-term debt to supplement our operating cash flow while
    maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities.
    Additionally, we sometimes acquire short-term investments to
    maximize our income on available cash balances. As needed, we
    may reduce our investment balances to further supplement our
    operating cash flow.

In January 2009, we issued $500 million of
    5.625% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2014 and
    $700 million of 6.30% senior unsecured notes due
    January 15, 2019. The net proceeds received of
    $1.187 billion, after discounts and issuance costs, were
    used primarily to repay Devon’s $1.005 billion of
    outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2008.

Subsequent to the $1.0 billion commercial paper repayment
    in January 2009, we utilized additional commercial paper
    borrowings of $1.4 billion to fund capital expenditure and
    dividend payments in excess of our operating cash flow during
    2009.

During 2008, we reduced our short-term investment balances by
    $250 million. We also received $280 million from the
    exchange of our investment in Chevron common stock,
    $117 million from the sale of non-oil and gas property and
    equipment and $116 million from stock option exercises.
    Another significant source of cash was our African divestiture
    program. In 2008, we received $2.6 billion in proceeds
    ($1.9 billion net of income taxes and purchase price
    adjustments) from sales of assets located in Equatorial Guinea
    and other West African countries. Also, in conjunction with
    these asset sales, we repatriated an additional
    $2.6 billion of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries
    to the United States. We used these combined sources of cash in
    2008 to fund debt repayments, common stock repurchases,
    redemptions of preferred stock and dividends on common and
    preferred stock.

During 2007, we borrowed $1.5 billion under our unsecured
    revolving line of credit and reduced our short-term investment
    balances by $202 million. We also received
    $341 million of proceeds from the sale of our Egyptian
    operations. These sources of cash were used primarily to fund
    net commercial paper repayments, long-term debt repayments,
    common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred
    stock.



Capital
    Expenditures

Following are the components of our capital expenditures for the
    years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007. The amounts in the table below
    reflect cash payments for capital expenditures, including cash
    paid for capital expenditures incurred. Capital expenditures
    actually incurred during 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately
    $4.7 billion, $10.0 billion and $5.9 billion,
    respectively.

Our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil
    and gas exploration and development operations, our midstream
    operations and other corporate activities. The vast majority of
    our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling or
    development of oil and gas properties, which totaled
    $4.3 billion, $8.2 billion and $5.2 billion in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in capital
    expenditures from 2008 to 2009 was due to decreased drilling
    activities in most of our operating areas in response to lower
    commodity prices in 2009 compared to recent years. The 2008
    capital expenditures include $2.6 billion related to
    acquisitions of properties in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and
    Canada. Excluding the effect of the 2008 acquisitions, the
    increase in capital expenditures from 2007 to 2008 was due to
    increased drilling activities in the Barnett Shale, Gulf of
    Mexico, Carthage, Groesbeck and Washakie areas of the United
    States and the Lloydminster and Jackfish projects in Canada.
    Expenditures in the first half of 2008 also increased due to
    inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field
    services.

Our capital expenditures for our midstream operations are
    primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas
    processing plants, natural gas pipeline systems and oil
    pipelines. These midstream facilities exist primarily to support
    our oil and gas development operations. The majority of our
    midstream expenditures from 2007 to 2009 were related to
    development activities in the Barnett Shale, the Arkoma-Woodford
    Shale in southeastern Oklahoma, the Cana-Woodford Shale in
    western Oklahoma and Jackfish in Canada.

Net
    Repayments of Debt

Debt repayments in 2009 include the retirement of
    $177 million of 10.125% notes upon maturity in the
    fourth quarter.

During 2008, we repaid $1.5 billion in outstanding credit
    facility borrowings primarily with proceeds received from the
    sales of assets under our African divestiture program. Also
    during 2008, virtually all holders of exchangeable debentures
    exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares
    of Chevron common stock owned by us. The debentures matured on
    August 15, 2008. In lieu of delivering our shares of
    Chevron common stock, we exercised our option to pay the
    exchanging debenture holders cash totaling $1.0 billion.
    This amount included the retirement of debentures with a book
    value of $652 million and a $379 million payment of
    the related embedded derivative option.

During 2007, we repaid the $400 million 4.375% notes,
    which matured on October 1, 2007. Also during 2007, certain
    holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to
    exchange their debentures for shares of Chevron common stock
    prior to the debentures’ August 15, 2008 maturity
    date. In lieu of delivering shares of Chevron common stock, we
    exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders an
    amount of cash equal to the market value of Chevron common
    stock. We paid $167 million in cash to exchangeable



debenture holders who exercised their exchange rights. This
    amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value
    of $105 million and a $62 million payment of the
    related embedded derivative option.

Repurchases
    of Common Stock

During 2008 and 2007, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at
    a total cost of $1.0 billion, or an average of $93.76 per
    share, under approved repurchase programs. No shares were
    repurchased in 2009. The following table summarizes our
    repurchases under approved plans during 2008 and 2007 (amounts
    and shares in millions). Both programs expired on
    December 31, 2009.

Redemption
    of Preferred Stock

On June 20, 2008, we redeemed all 1.5 million
    outstanding shares of our 6.49% Series A cumulative
    preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock was redeemed for
    cash at a redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends up to the redemption date.

Dividends

Our common stock dividends were $284 million (or a
    quarterly rate of $0.16 per share) in both 2009 and 2008, and
    $249 million (or a quarterly rate of $0.14) in 2007. Common
    dividends increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the
    higher quarterly dividend rates.

We also paid $5 million of preferred stock dividends in
    2008 and $10 million of preferred stock dividends in 2007.
    The decrease in the preferred dividends in 2008 was due to the
    redemption of our preferred stock in the second quarter of 2008.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has
    been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain revolving
    lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be
    accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other
    available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance
    of equity securities, as well as our automatically effective
    registration statement on

Form S-3ASR

filed with the SEC. This registration statement can be used to
    offer short-term and long-term debt securities. In 2010, another
    major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our
    offshore operations, which we estimate will range from
    $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion after taxes. We expect
    the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to
    fund future capital expenditures, debt repayments and other
    contractual commitments as discussed later in this section.

Operating
    Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most
    volatile of which is pricing of the oil, natural gas and NGLs we
    produce. Due to sharp declines in commodity prices, our
    operating cash flow decreased approximately 50% to
    $4.7 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. In spite of the
    recent commodity price declines, we expect operating cash flow
    will continue to be a primary source of liquidity, and we will
    need to manage our capital expenditures and other cash uses
    accordingly. However, as a result of depressed commodity prices,
    debt borrowings have been a significant source of liquidity
    during 2009. During 2009, our net borrowings of long-term debt
    and commercial paper totaled $1.6 billion. We anticipate
    utilizing commercial paper borrowings as needed to supplement
    operating cash flow in 2010. As the offshore divestiture
    transactions close, we anticipate using a portion of the
    proceeds to repay our commercial paper borrowings.



Commodity Prices

— Prices for oil, gas and NGLs
    are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions.
    Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other
    substantially variable factors influence market conditions for
    these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict,
    create volatility in oil, gas and NGL prices and are beyond our
    control. We expect this volatility to continue throughout 2010.

To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we have
    utilized various price swap, fixed-price physical delivery and
    price collar contracts to set minimum and maximum prices on our
    2010 production. As of February 15, 2010 approximately 65%
    of our estimated 2010 oil production is subject to price collars
    and approximately 54% of our estimated 2010 gas production is
    subject to price collars, price swaps and fixed-price physicals.
    We also have basis swaps associated with 0.2 Bcf per day of
    our 2010 gas production.

Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through
    an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity
    price increases, as experienced in recent years, can lead to an
    increase in drilling and development activities. As a result,
    the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and
    materials may also increase, causing a negative impact on our
    cash flow. However, the inverse is also true during periods of
    depressed commodity prices such as what we are currently
    experiencing.

Interest Rates

— Our operating cash flow can
    also be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. As of
    February 15, 2010, we had total debt of $7.1 billion
    with an overall weighted average borrowing rate of 5.93%. To
    manage our exposure to interest rate volatility, we have
    interest rate swap instruments with a total notional amount of
    $1.85 billion. These consist of instruments with a notional
    amount of $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate
    and pay a variable rate. The remaining instruments consist of
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, we will net settle these contracts in September 2011, or
    sooner should we elect, based upon us paying a fixed rate and
    receiving a floating rate. Including the effects of these swaps,
    the weighted-average interest rate related to our fixed-rate
    debt was 5.36% as of February 15, 2010.

Credit Losses

— Our operating cash flow is also
    exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. We are exposed to
    the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil, gas and
    NGL production. We are also exposed to credit risk related to
    the collection of receivables from our joint-interest partners
    for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects
    we operate. We are also exposed to the credit risk of
    counterparties to our derivative financial contracts as
    discussed previously in this report.

The recent deterioration of the global financial and capital
    markets, combined with the drop in commodity prices, has
    increased our credit risk exposure. However, we utilize a
    variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks
    of our customers, partners and counterparties. Such mechanisms
    include, under certain conditions, posting of letters of credit,
    prepayment requirements and collateral posting requirements.

Credit
    Availability

We have two revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper
    program which we can access to provide liquidity.

We have a $2.65 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving
    line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The
    maturity date for $2.15 billion of the Senior Credit
    Facility is April 7, 2013. The maturity date for the
    remaining $0.5 billion is April 7, 2012. All amounts
    outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity
    dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, we have the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at our
    election, bear interest at various fixed rate options for
    periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally less
    than the prime rate. However, we may elect to borrow at the
    prime rate. As February 15, 2010, there were no borrowings
    under the Senior Credit Facility.

We also have a $700 million

364-day,

syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the
    “Short-Term Facility”) that matures on
    November 2, 2010. On the maturity date, all amounts
    outstanding will be due



and payable at that time. Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term
    Facility bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods
    of up to 12 months. Such rates are generally based on LIBOR
    or the prime rate. As of February 15, 2010, there were no
    borrowings under the Short-Term Facility.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $2.85 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility or the Short-Term Facility on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index
    such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate
    as found on the commercial paper market. As of February 15,
    2010, we had $1.3 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at an average rate of 0.25%.

The Senior Credit Facility and Short-Term Facility contain only
    one material financial covenant. This covenant requires our
    ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less
    than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions of total
    funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to
    the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back
    noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling
    impairments or goodwill impairments. As of December 31,
    2009, we were in compliance with this covenant. Our

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2009, as calculated pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, was 20.5%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility and
    Short-Term Facility is not restricted under any “material
    adverse effect” clauses. It is not uncommon for credit
    agreements to include such clauses. These clauses can remove the
    obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition
    or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and
    adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition,
    operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the
    borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments, or the
    enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. While
    our credit facilities include covenants that require us to
    report a condition or event having a material adverse effect,
    the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not
    conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.

The following schedule summarizes the capacity of our credit
    facilities by maturity date, as well as our available capacity

Debt
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the
    United States. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies
    consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
    levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
    commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
    agencies. Our current debt ratings are BBB+ with a stable
    outlook by both Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, and
    Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.



There are no “rating triggers” in any of our
    contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled
    maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level.
    Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility is
    predicated on our corporate debt rating. Therefore, even though
    a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities,
    it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings
    under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Senior
    Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the
    fully-drawn borrowing costs from LIBOR plus 35 basis points
    to a new rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. A ratings
    downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to
    economically access debt markets in the future. As of
    December 31, 2009, we were not aware of any potential
    ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our 2010 capital expenditures are expected to range from
    $6.0 billion to $6.8 billion, including amounts
    related to our discontinued operations. To a certain degree, the
    ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our
    control. Therefore, if oil and gas prices fluctuate from current
    estimates, we could choose to defer a portion of these planned
    2010 capital expenditures until later periods, or accelerate
    capital expenditures planned for periods beyond 2010 to achieve
    the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. The
    amount and timing of the planned offshore asset divestitures in
    2010 could also result in acceleration of capital spending on
    our North American Onshore opportunities. Based upon current
    price expectations for 2010 and the commodity hedging contracts
    we have in place, we anticipate having adequate capital
    resources to fund our 2010 capital expenditures.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Programs

All of our common stock repurchase programs expired on
    December 31, 2009. None of our programs were extended to
    2010.

Additionally, our commitment under these contracts may be
    further reduced if the buyers of our offshore assets assume all
    or a portion of the obligations. If the buyers do not assume
    these obligations, we will attempt to sublease the rigs to
    reduce our commitment. However, if the buyers do not assume the
    obligations and we are not able to sublease the rigs, we would
    be contractually committed to the amounts related to the
    remaining lease periods.

We have an offshore platform spar that is being used in the
    development of the Nansen field in the Gulf of Mexico. This spar
    is subject to a

20-year

lease and contains various options whereby we may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spars. We have guaranteed that
    the spar will have a residual value at the end of the term equal
    to at least 10% of the fair value of the spar at the inception
    of the lease. The total guaranteed value is $14 million in
    2022. However, such amount may be reduced under the terms of the
    lease agreements. In 2005, we sold our interests in the Boomvang
    field in the Gulf of Mexico, which has a spar lease with terms
    similar to those of the Nansen lease. As a result of the sale,
    we are subleasing the Boomvang spar. The table above does not
    include any amounts related to the Boomvang spar lease. However,
    if the sublessee were to default on its obligation, we would
    continue to be obligated to pay the periodic lease payments and
    any guaranteed value required at the end of the term.

We also lease three FPSO’s that are related to the Panyu
    project offshore China, the Polvo project offshore Brazil and
    the Cascade project offshore the Gulf of Mexico. The Panyu FPSO
    lease term expires in 2018. The Polvo FPSO lease term expires in
    2014. The Cascade FPSO lease term expires in 2015. We expect the
    eventual buyers of these offshore assets will assume the FPSO
    leases. However, the amounts in the table reflect our full
    commitments under the leases.

These amounts include $272 million related to uncertain tax
    positions. Expected pension funding obligations have not been
    included in this table, but are presented and discussed in the
    section immediately below.

Pension
    Funding and Estimates

Funded Status —

As compared to the
    projected benefit obligation, our qualified and nonqualified
    defined benefit plans were underfunded by $448 million and
    $501 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,



respectively. A detailed reconciliation of the 2009 changes to
    our underfunded status is included in Note 8 to the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. Of the
    $448 million underfunded status at the end of 2009,
    $215 million is attributable to various nonqualified
    defined benefit plans that have no plan assets. However, we have
    established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of
    such nonqualified plans. As of December 31, 2009, these
    trusts had investments with a fair value of $39 million.
    The value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets
    in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As compared to the accumulated benefit obligation, our qualified
    defined benefit plans were underfunded by $164 million at
    December 31, 2009. The accumulated benefit obligation
    differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former
    includes no assumption about future compensation levels.

Our funding policy regarding the qualified defined benefit plans
    is to contribute the amounts necessary for the plans’
    assets to approximately equal the present value of benefits
    earned by the participants, as calculated in accordance with the
    provisions of the Pension Protection Act. While we did have
    investment gains in 2009, the investment losses experienced
    during 2008 significantly reduced the value of our plans’
    assets. We estimate we will contribute approximately
    $25 million to our qualified pension plans during 2010.
    However, actual contributions may be different than this amount.

Our funding policy regarding the nonqualified defined benefit
    plans is to supplement as needed the amounts accumulated in the
    related trusts with available cash and cash equivalents.

Pension Estimate Assumptions —

Our pension
    expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’
    approximate service periods and is impacted by funding decisions
    or requirements. We recognized expense for our defined benefit
    pension plans of $119 million, $61 million and
    $41 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
    estimate that our pension expense will approximate
    $85 million in 2010. Should our actual 2010 contributions
    to qualified and nonqualified plans vary significantly from our
    current estimate of $34 million, our actual 2010 pension
    expense could vary from this estimate.

The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
    requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
    assumptions can result in different expense and liability
    amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
    We believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting
    pension expense and liabilities are the expected long-term rate
    of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
    weighted average rate of return of 7.18% and 8.40% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We developed
    these expected long-term rate of return assumptions by
    evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. The expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of
    investment types in such assets. At December 31, 2009, the
    target allocations for plan assets were 47.5% for equity
    securities, 40% for fixed-income securities and 12.5% for other
    investment types. Equity securities consist of investments in
    large capitalization and small capitalization companies, both
    domestic and international. Fixed-income securities include
    corporate bonds of investment-grade companies from diverse
    industries, United States Treasury obligations and asset-backed
    securities. Other investment types include short-term investment
    funds and a hedge fund of funds. We expect our long-term asset
    allocation on average to approximate the targeted allocation. We
    regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically
    rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when
    considered appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
    assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
    assumption of 100 basis points would increase the expected
    2010 pension expense by $5 million.

We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted
    average rate of 6.00% at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The
    discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the
    rate at which obligations could be effectively settled,
    considering the expected timing of future cash flows related to
    the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after
    allowing for call and default risk. We consider high quality
    corporate bond yield indices, such as Moody’s Aa, when
    selecting the discount rate.



The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
    as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
    25 basis points would increase our pension liability at
    December 31, 2009, by $32 million, and increase
    estimated 2010 pension expense by $4 million.

At December 31, 2009, we had net actuarial losses of
    $334 million, which will be recognized as a component of
    pension expense in future years. These losses are primarily due
    to investment losses on plan assets in 2008, reductions in the
    discount rate since 2001 and increases in participant wages. We
    estimate that approximately $27 million and
    $23 million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be
    included in pension expense in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The
    $27 million estimated to be recognized in 2010 is a
    component of the total estimated 2010 pension expense of
    $85 million referred to earlier in this section.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
    various other factors related to the participants in our defined
    benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and
    liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors
    will be in the future.

Contingencies
    and Legal Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters,
    see Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known.

The critical accounting policies used by management in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those
    that are important both to the presentation of our financial
    condition and results of operations and require significant
    judgments by management with regard to estimates used. Our
    critical accounting policies and significant judgments and
    estimates related to those policies are described below. We have
    reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit
    Committee of our Board of Directors.

Full
    Cost Ceiling Calculations

Policy
    Description

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
    calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
    amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
    sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
    after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
    properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
    value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
    subject to amortization. If our net book value of oil and gas
    properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of
    the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an
    expense. The ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each
    country in which we have oil and gas properties. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The discounted present value of future net revenues for our
    proved oil, gas and NGL reserves is a major component of the
    ceiling calculation, and represents the component that requires
    the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are
    forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of
    production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of
    estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves requires substantial
    judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly
    for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make
    different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same
    data. Certain of our reserve estimates



are prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants, while
    other reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers. See
    Note 22 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for a summary of the amount of our reserves that are
    prepared or audited by outside petroleum consultants.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
    regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior
    estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
    years, annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates,
    which have been both increases and decreases in individual
    years, have averaged less than 2% of the previous year’s
    estimate. However, there can be no assurance that more
    significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. If
    future significant revisions are necessary that reduce
    previously estimated reserve quantities, it could result in a
    full cost property writedown. In addition to the impact of the
    estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling,
    estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of
    the calculation of DD&A.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
    judgment, the associated prices of oil, gas and NGL reserves,
    and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the
    discounted present value of the reserves do not require
    judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10% discount
    factor be used and future net revenues are calculated using
    prices that represent the average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the

12-month

period prior to the end of each quarterly period. Costs included
    in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner.
    Therefore, the future net revenues associated with the estimated
    proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices
    or costs. In calculating the ceiling, we adjust the

end-of-period

price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment. This adjustment requires
    little judgment as the calculated average price is adjusted
    using the contract prices for such hedges. None of our
    outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2009
    qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates the use of prices that
    are not representative of future prices and requires a 10%
    discount factor, the resulting value is not indicative of the
    true fair value of the reserves. Oil and gas prices have
    historically been cyclical and, for any particular

12-month

period, can be either higher or lower than our long-term price
    forecast, which is a more appropriate input for estimating fair
    value. Therefore, oil and gas property writedowns that result
    from applying the full cost ceiling limitation, and that are
    caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the
    underlying quantities of reserves, should not be viewed as
    absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the
    related reserves.

Because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not
    possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost
    writedowns.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Policy
    Description

We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with
    respect to a portion of our oil and gas production that hedge
    the future prices received. These instruments are used to manage
    the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas
    price volatility. Our oil and gas derivative financial
    instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps and
    costless price collars. Additionally, we periodically enter into
    interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate
    volatility. Under the terms of certain of our interest-rate
    swaps, we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a
    total notional amount. The remainder of our swaps represent
    forward starting swaps, under which we will pay a fixed rate and
    receive a floating rate on a total notional amount.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
    such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If such criteria are met for
    fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is recorded in
    the statement of operations with an



offsetting amount recorded for the change in fair value of the
    hedged item. Cash settlements with counterparties to our
    derivative financial instruments also increase or decrease
    earnings at the time of the settlement.

A derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the
    derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business
    combination or other transaction that includes derivative
    contracts. Additionally, we must document the relationship
    between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as the
    risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    instrument. We must also assess, both at the instrument’s
    inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative is
    highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the
    hedged item. For derivative financial instruments held during
    2009, 2008 and 2007, we chose not to meet the necessary criteria
    to qualify our derivative financial instruments for hedge
    accounting treatment.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments
    require substantial judgment. We estimate the fair values of our
    oil and gas derivative financial instruments primarily by using
    internal discounted cash flow calculations. The most significant
    variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future
    commodity prices. We base our estimate of future prices upon
    published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC
    Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West
    Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Another
    key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of
    volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily
    upon implied volatility. The resulting estimated future cash
    inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are
    discounted using LIBOR and money market futures rates for the
    first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter.
    These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the
    period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes
    in forward prices and regional price differentials.

We estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial
    instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow
    calculations based upon forward interest-rate yields. The most
    significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our
    estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our estimate of
    future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward
    curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by
    third parties. The resulting estimated future cash inflows or
    outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted using
    LIBOR and money market futures rates for the first year and
    money market futures and swap rates thereafter. These yield and
    discounting variables are sensitive to the period of the
    contract and market volatility as well as changes in forward
    interest rate yields.

We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing
    our internally generated fair value estimates with those
    obtained from contract counterparties

and/or

brokers.

In spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets,
    counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our
    cash flow calculations and derivative valuations. This is
    primarily the result of two factors. First, we have mitigated
    our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with
    numerous counterparties. Our commodity derivative contracts are
    held with twelve separate counterparties, and our interest rate
    derivative contracts are held with seven separate
    counterparties. Second, our derivative contracts generally
    require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the
    counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment
    grade”. The

mark-to-market

exposure threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt
    rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds
    generally range from zero to $50 million for the majority
    of our contracts. As of December 31, 2009, the credit
    ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade.

Because we have chosen not to qualify our derivatives for hedge
    accounting treatment, changes in the fair values of derivatives
    can have a significant impact on our results of operations.
    Generally, changes in derivative fair values will not impact our
    liquidity or capital resources.

Settlements of derivative instruments, regardless of whether
    they qualify for hedge accounting, do have an impact on our
    liquidity and results of operations. Generally, if actual market
    prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments,
    our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower
    relative to the results



that would have occurred absent these instruments. The opposite
    is also true. Additional information regarding the effects that
    changes in market prices can have on our derivative financial
    instruments, net earnings and cash flow from operations is
    included in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk.”

Business
    Combinations

Policy
    Description

From our beginning as a public company in 1988 through 2003, we
    grew substantially through acquisitions of other oil and gas
    companies. Most of these acquisitions have been accounted for
    using the purchase method of accounting. Current accounting
    pronouncements require the purchase method to be used to account
    for any future acquisitions.

Under the purchase method, the acquiring company adds to its
    balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired
    company’s assets and liabilities. Any excess of the
    purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and
    intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is assessed for impairment at least annually.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

There are various assumptions we make in determining the fair
    values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities. The
    most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most
    judgment, involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas
    properties acquired. To determine the fair values of these
    properties, we prepare estimates of oil, gas and NGL reserves.
    These estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and
    that of outside consultants. The judgments associated with these
    estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in
    connection with the full cost ceiling calculation.

However, there are factors involved in estimating the fair
    values of acquired oil, gas and NGL properties that require more
    judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling
    calculation. As stated above, the full cost ceiling calculation
    dictates the use of prices that are not representative of future
    prices. By contrast, the fair value of reserves acquired in a
    business combination must be based on our estimates of future
    oil, gas and NGL prices. Our estimates of future prices are
    based on our own analysis of pricing trends. These estimates are
    based on current data obtained with regard to regional and
    worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth
    forecasts. They are also based on industry data regarding gas
    storage availability, drilling rig activity, changes in delivery
    capacity, trends in regional pricing differentials and other
    fundamental analysis. Forecasts of future prices from
    independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing
    estimates.

We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve
    quantities acquired, and estimate future operating and
    development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net
    revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues
    are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the
    time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital.

We also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair
    value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination.
    These unproved properties generally represent the value of
    probable and possible reserves. Because of their very nature,
    probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than
    those of proved reserves. To compensate for the inherent risk of
    estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future
    net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by
    what we consider to be an appropriate risk-weighting factor in
    each particular instance. It is common for the discounted future
    net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by
    factors ranging from 30% to 80% to arrive at what we consider to
    be the appropriate fair values.

Generally, in our business combinations, the determination of
    the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more
    judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities.
    The acquired companies commonly have long-term debt that we
    assume in the acquisition, and this debt must be recorded at the
    estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt. However,
    significant judgment on our behalf is usually not



required in these situations due to the existence of comparable
    market values of debt issued by peer companies.

Except for the 2002 acquisition of Mitchell Energy &
    Development Corp., our mergers and acquisitions have involved
    other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area
    of exploration, development and production activities related to
    oil and gas properties. However, in addition to exploration,
    development and production activities, Mitchell’s business
    also included substantial marketing and midstream activities.
    Therefore, a portion of the Mitchell purchase price was
    allocated to the fair value of Mitchell’s marketing and
    midstream facilities and equipment. This consisted primarily of
    natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems.

The Mitchell midstream assets primarily serve gas producing
    properties that we also acquired from Mitchell. Therefore,
    certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the
    gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the
    midstream assets. For example, future quantities of gas
    estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were
    based on the same estimates used to value the proved and
    unproved gas producing properties. Future expected prices for
    marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price
    cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas
    producing assets acquired from Mitchell. Based on historical
    costs and known trends and commitments, we also estimated future
    operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream
    assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows. These cash
    flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to
    discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets
    to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and
    midstream facilities and equipment.

In addition to the valuation methods described above, we perform
    other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in
    any business combination. These analyses include information
    related to comparable companies, comparable transactions and
    premiums paid.

In a comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
    market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
    independent exploration and production companies with comparable
    financial and operating characteristics. Such characteristics
    are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
    characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to
    those of the party to the proposed business combination. We
    compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed
    business combination company multiples for reasonableness.

In a comparable transactions analysis, we review certain
    acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and
    production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages
    announced recently. We compare these comparable transaction
    multiples to the proposed business combination transaction
    multiples for reasonableness.

In a premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected
    independent exploration and production company transactions in
    addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded
    companies announced recently, to review the premiums paid to the
    price of the target one day, one week and one month prior to the
    announcement of the transaction. We use this information to
    determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to
    the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness.

While these estimates of fair value for the various assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity
    or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future
    results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value
    assigned to both the oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas
    properties, the lower future net earnings will be as a result of
    higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
    Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas
    properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas
    prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling
    writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop
    below our price forecast that was used to originally determine
    fair value. A full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect
    on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it
    is a noncash charge, but it would adversely affect results of
    operations. As discussed in “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Capital Resources, Uses and
    Liquidity,” in calculating our

debt-to-capitalization

ratio under our credit agreement, total capitalization is
    adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full
    cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments.



Our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many
    estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair
    value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business
    combination. As previously disclosed in our discussion of the
    full cost ceiling calculations, during the past five years, our
    annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates have
    averaged less than 2%. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
    there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity
    estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil
    and gas properties acquired in a business combination. The
    inter-relationship of these estimates makes it impractical to
    provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of
    changes in these estimates.

Valuation
    of Goodwill

Policy
    Description

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The annual impairment test, which we conduct as of October 31
    each year, requires us to estimate the fair values of our own
    assets and liabilities. Because quoted market prices are not
    available for our reporting units, the fair values of the
    reporting units are estimated in a manner similar to the process
    described above for a business combination. Therefore,
    considerable judgment similar to that described above in
    connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company
    in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill
    for impairment. At October 31, 2009, the fair values of our
    United States and Canadian reporting units were more than double
    their related carrying values. This excess largely results from
    the reductions of carrying value that we recognized in 2008 and
    2009 due to full cost ceiling limitations, which are not
    representative of the fair values of our oil and gas properties.
    Excluding the effects of these reductions, the fair values of
    our United States and Canadian reporting units exceeded the
    carrying values by approximately 40% and 80%, respectively.

Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil
    and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower
    goodwill would be. A lower goodwill value decreases the
    likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes
    in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the
    likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill
    impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital
    resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of
    operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
    in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
    provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
    changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
    average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.

Forward-Looking
    Estimates

We are providing our 2010 forward-looking estimates in the
    following discussion. These estimates are based on our
    examination of historical operating trends, the information used
    to prepare our December 31, 2009 reserve reports and other
    data in our possession or available from third parties. The
    forward-looking estimates in this discussion were prepared
    assuming demand, curtailment, producibility and general market
    conditions for our oil, gas and NGLs during 2010 will be
    substantially similar to those that existed in 2009, unless
    otherwise noted. We make reference to the “Disclosure
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of
    this report. Amounts related to Canadian operations have been
    converted to U.S. dollars using an estimated average 2010
    exchange rate of $0.95 U.S. dollar to $1.00 Canadian dollar.

We plan to strategically reposition Devon by divesting our
    U.S. Offshore and International assets. We have entered
    into agreements to sell our interests in the Cascade, Jack and
    St. Malo properties in the Gulf of



Mexico. The following estimates assume these transactions close
    on the expected dates during the first quarter of 2010. Although
    we expect to complete the remainder of the divestitures
    throughout 2010, all estimates presented assume the remaining
    divestitures close at the end of 2010.

Oil and
    Gas Prices

We expect our 2010 average prices for the oil and gas production
    from each of our operating areas to differ from the NYMEX price
    as set forth in the following table. The expected ranges for
    prices are exclusive of the anticipated effects of the financial
    contracts presented in the “Commodity Price Risk
    Management” section below.

The NYMEX price for oil is determined using the monthly average
    of settled prices on each trading day for benchmark West Texas
    Intermediate crude oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma. The NYMEX
    price for gas is determined using the

first-of-month

South Louisiana Henry Hub price index as published monthly in
    Inside FERC.

Commodity
    Price Risk Management

From time to time, we enter into NYMEX related financial
    commodity collar, price swap and basis swap contracts. Such
    contracts are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future
    revenues due to oil and gas price volatility. Although these
    financial contracts do not relate to specific production from
    our operating areas, they will affect our overall revenues,
    earnings and cash flow in 2010.

As of February 15, 2010, our financial commodity contracts
    pertaining to 2010 consisted of oil and gas price collars, gas
    price swaps and gas basis swaps. The key terms of these
    contracts are presented in the following tables.

To the extent that monthly NYMEX prices or differentials on
    certain regional indexes in 2010 are outside of the ranges
    established by the collars or differ from those established by
    the swaps, we and the counterparties to the contracts will
    cash-settle the difference. Such settlements will either
    increase or decrease our revenues for the period. Also, we will

mark-to-market

the contracts based on their fair values throughout 2010.
    Changes in the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded
    as increases or decreases to our revenues. The expected ranges
    of our realized prices as a percentage of NYMEX prices, which
    are presented earlier in this report, do not include any
    estimates of the impact on our prices from monthly settlements
    or changes in the fair values of our price collars and swaps.

Marketing
    and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived
    primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline
    systems. These revenues and expenses vary in response to several
    factors. The factors include, but are not limited to, changes in
    production from wells connected to the pipelines and related
    processing plants, changes in the absolute and relative prices
    of gas and NGLs, provisions of contractual agreements and the
    amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain
    anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes.

These factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
    future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
    these uncertainties, we estimate that our 2010 marketing and
    midstream operating profit will be between $450 million and
    $525 million. We estimate that marketing and midstream
    revenues will be between $1.850 billion and
    $2.125 billion, and marketing and midstream expenses will
    be between $1.400 billion and $1.600 billion.

Lease
    Operating Expenses

These expenses, which include transportation costs, vary in
    response to several factors. Among the most significant of these
    factors are additions to or deletions from the property base,
    changes in the general price level of services and materials
    that are used in the operation of the properties, the amount of
    repair and workover activity required. Oil, gas and NGL prices
    also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the
    economic feasibility of planned workover projects.



Given these uncertainties, we expect that our 2010 lease
    operating expenses will be between $1.74 billion and
    $1.90 billion. This estimated range includes
    $1.58 billion to $1.72 billion related to our North
    American Onshore business and $0.16 to $0.18 billion
    associated with our U.S. Offshore operations.

Taxes
    Other Than Income Taxes

Our taxes other than income taxes primarily consist of
    production taxes and ad valorem taxes that relate to our
    U.S. Onshore properties and are assessed by various
    government agencies. Production taxes are based on a percentage
    of production revenues that varies by property and government
    jurisdiction. Ad valorem taxes generally are based on property
    values as determined by the government agency assessing the tax.
    Over time, a certain property’s assessed value will
    increase or decrease due to changes in commodity sales prices,
    production volumes and proved reserves. Therefore, ad valorem
    taxes will generally move in the same direction as our oil, gas
    and NGL sales but in a less predictable manner compared to
    production taxes. Additionally, both production and ad valorem
    taxes will increase or decrease due to changes in the rates
    assessed by the government agencies.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that our taxes other than
    income taxes for 2010 will be between 4.50% and 5.50% of total
    oil, gas and NGL sales. We estimate our 2010 taxes other than
    income taxes for our North American Onshore operations will
    range from 4.75% to 5.75% of revenues. We estimate the
    U.S. Offshore rates will range from 1.00% to 2.00% of
    revenues.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”)

Our 2010 oil and gas property DD&A rate will depend on
    various factors. Most notable among such factors are the amount
    of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or
    acquisition efforts in 2010 compared to the costs incurred for
    such efforts, revisions to our year-end 2009 reserve estimates
    that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made during
    2010, as well as reductions of carrying value resulting from
    full cost ceiling tests.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that our oil and gas
    property related DD&A rate will be between $7.60 per Boe
    and $8.10 per Boe. Based on these DD&A rates and the
    production estimates set forth earlier, oil and gas property
    related DD&A expense for 2010 is expected to be between
    $1.77 billion and $1.89 billion.

For our North American Onshore assets, we estimate the DD&A
    rate will range from $7.65 to $8.15 per Boe, resulting in
    estimated DD&A expense of $1.69 billion to
    $1.80 billion. Our U.S. Offshore DD&A rate is
    estimated to be between $6.75 and $7.25 per Boe, resulting in
    estimated DD&A expense of $0.08 billion to
    $0.09 billion.

Additionally, we expect that our depreciation and amortization
    expense related to non-oil and gas property fixed assets will
    total between $270 million and $300 million in 2010.
    This estimate relates entirely to our North American Onshore
    assets.

Accretion
    of Asset Retirement Obligation

Accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2010 is expected to
    be between $95 million and $105 million. This
    estimated range includes $70 million to $80 million
    related to our North American Onshore business and
    $25 million associated with our U.S. Offshore
    operations.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our G&A includes employee compensation and benefits costs
    and the costs of many different goods and services used in
    support of our business. G&A varies with the level of our
    operating activities and the related staffing and professional
    services requirements. In addition, employee compensation and
    benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect
    the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to
    employees. Also, goods and services are subject to general price
    level increases or decreases. Therefore, significant



variances in any of these factors from current expectations
    could cause actual G&A to vary materially from the estimate.

Given these limitations, we estimate our G&A for 2010 will
    be between $580 million and $620 million. This
    estimate includes approximately $115 million of non-cash,
    share-based compensation, net of related capitalization in
    accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and
    gas properties.

Restructuring
    Costs

In conjunction with the planned 2010 asset divestitures, we
    estimate we will incur certain one-time restructuring costs
    totaling between $203 million and $273 million. Such
    costs estimates consist of employee severance and termination
    costs, contract termination costs and other associated costs. We
    recognized $153 million of employee severance costs during
    the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect the majority of the
    remaining restructuring costs, including any revisions to the
    fourth quarter 2009 employee severance costs, will be
    recognized during 2010.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

Due to the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not
    possible to predict whether we will incur full cost writedowns
    in 2010.

Interest
    Expense

Future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant
    effect on our interest expense. We can only marginally influence
    the prices we will receive in 2010 from sales of oil, gas and
    NGLs and the resulting cash flow. This increases the margin of
    error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances
    and related interest expense. Other factors that affect
    outstanding debt balances and related interest expense, such as
    the amount and timing of capital expenditures are generally
    within our control.

As of February 15, 2010, we had total debt of
    $7.1 billion. This included $5.8 billion of fixed-rate
    debt and $1.3 billion of variable-rate commercial paper
    borrowings. The fixed-rate debt bears interest at an overall
    weighted average rate of 7.2%. The commercial paper borrowings
    bear interest at variable rates based on a standard index such
    as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as
    found on the commercial paper market. As of February 15,
    2010, the weighted average variable rate for our commercial
    paper borrowings was 0.25%. Additionally, any future borrowings
    under our credit facilities would bear interest at various
    fixed-rate options for periods up to twelve months and are
    generally less than the prime rate.

Based on the factors above, we expect our 2010 interest expense
    to be between $325 million and $365 million. The
    estimated interest expense is exclusive of the anticipated
    effects of the interest rate swap contracts presented in the
    “Interest Rate Risk Management” section below.

The 2010 interest expense estimate above is comprised of three
    primary components — interest related to outstanding
    debt, fees and issuance costs, and capitalized interest. We
    expect the interest expense in 2010 related to our fixed-rate
    and floating-rate debt, including net accretion of related
    discounts, to be between $395 million and
    $435 million. We expect the interest expense in 2010
    related to facility and agency fees, amortization of debt
    issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to
    outstanding debt balances to be between $10 million and
    $20 million. We also expect to capitalize between
    $80 million and $90 million of interest
    during 2010.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management

From time to time, we enter into interest rate swaps. Such
    contracts are used to manage our exposure to interest rate
    volatility.



As of February 15, 2010, our interest rate swaps pertaining
    to 2010 consist of instruments with a notional amount of
    $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a
    variable rate. The key terms of these contracts are presented in
    the following table.

Income
    Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2010 will vary materially
    depending on the actual amount of financial pre-tax earnings.
    The tax rate for 2010 will be significantly affected by the
    proportional share of consolidated pre-tax earnings generated by
    our United States and Canadian operations due to the different
    tax rates of each country. Also, certain tax deductions and
    credits will have a fixed impact on 2010 income tax expense
    regardless of the level of pre-tax earnings that are produced.
    Additionally, significant changes in estimated capital
    expenditures, production levels of oil, gas and NGLs, the prices
    of such products, marketing and midstream revenues, or any of
    the various expense items could materially alter the effect of
    these tax deductions and credits on 2010 financial income tax
    rates.

Given the uncertainty of pre-tax earnings, we expect that our
    total financial income tax rate in 2010 will be between 20% and
    40%. The current income tax rate is expected to be between 10%
    and 20%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to be between
    10% and 20%. These ranges do not include the impact of current
    and deferred income taxes that will be recognized upon the
    completion of the 2010 asset divestitures.

Discontinued
    Operations

The following table shows the estimates for 2010 production,
    pricing, expenses and capital associated with our discontinued
    International operations for 2010. These estimates assume the
    sales will occur at the end of 2010. Pursuant to accounting
    rules for discontinued operations, the International assets will
    not be subject to DD&A during 2010.

Capital
    Expenditures

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions in
    recent years, these transactions are opportunity driven. Thus,
    we do not forecast, nor can we reasonably predict, the timing or
    size of such possible acquisitions.

Our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of
    future oil, gas and NGL prices as well as the expected costs of
    the capital additions. Should actual prices received differ
    materially from our price expectations for our future
    production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred and,
    consequently, may increase or decrease total 2010 capital
    expenditures. In addition, if the actual material or labor costs
    of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated
    amounts, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from
    our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed above, the following table shows
    expected ranges for drilling, development and facilities
    expenditures by geographic area. Development capital includes
    development activity related to reserves classified as proved
    and drilling that does not offset currently productive units and
    for which there is not a certainty of continued production from
    a known productive formation. Exploration capital includes
    exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in
    previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs.

In addition to the above expenditures for drilling, development
    and facilities, we expect to capitalize between
    $330 million and $350 million of G&A expenses in
    accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to
    capitalize between $45 million and $55 million of
    interest. We also expect to pay between $80 million and
    $90 million for plugging and abandonment charges.
    Additionally, we expect to spend between $380 million and
    $430 million on our marketing and midstream assets, which
    primarily include our oil pipelines, gas processing plants, and
    gas pipeline systems. We expect to spend between
    $385 million and $435 million for corporate and other
    fixed assets.

Other
    Cash Uses

Our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common
    stock dividend to continue. With the current $0.16 per share
    quarterly dividend rate and 447 million shares of common
    stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009, dividends are
    expected to approximate $286 million.

Capital

Our estimated 2010 cash uses, including our capital activities,
    are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of our
    existing cash balances and operating cash flow. Another major
    source of liquidity will be proceeds from the divestiture of our
    offshore operations, which we estimate will range from
    $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion after taxes. The amount
    of operating cash flow to be generated during 2010 is uncertain
    due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously
    cited. The amount of divestiture proceeds we ultimately receive
    is also uncertain. However, we expect our combined capital
    resources will be adequate to fund our anticipated capital
    expenditures and other cash uses for 2010. Additionally, we can
    borrow commercial paper or access our lines of credit, which had
    an available capacity of approximately $2.0 billion as of
    February 15, 2010, to fund planned or additional capital
    activities.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market
    risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse
    changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. The following disclosures are not meant
    to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
    instruments were entered into for purposes other than
    speculative trading.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
    our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
    driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
    market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian gas and
    NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has been
    volatile and unpredictable for several years. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Consequently, we
    periodically enter into financial hedging activities with
    respect to a portion of our oil and gas production through
    various financial transactions that hedge the future prices
    received. These transactions include financial price swaps,
    basis swaps and costless price collars.

Based on gas price contracts in place as of December 31,
    2009, we have approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of gas
    production in 2010 that is associated with price swaps or
    fixed-price contracts. This amount represents approximately 50%
    of our estimated 2010 gas production. As of December 31,
    2009, we also have basis swaps associated with 0.2 Bcf per
    day of our 2010 gas production. All of the gas price swap
    contracts expire December 31, 2010. The key terms of our
    gas price contracts are presented in the following tables.

Based on oil price collar contracts in place as of
    December 31, 2009, we have hedged 79,000 barrels of
    oil per day for 2010. This amount represents approximately 65%
    of our estimated 2010 oil production. The key terms of our oil
    collar contracts are presented in the following table.

The fair values of our gas price and basis swaps and oil collars
    are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of
    relevant oil and gas price indexes. At December 31, 2009, a
    10% increase in these forward curves would have decreased the
    fair value of our gas price swaps by approximately
    $264 million. A 10% increase in the forward curves
    associated with our oil collars would have decreased the fair
    value of these instruments by approximately $108 million.



Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2009, we had debt outstanding of
    $7.3 billion. Of this amount, $5.9 billion, or 80%,
    bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Additionally, we
    had $1.4 billion of outstanding commercial paper, bearing
    interest at floating rates which averaged 0.29%.

As of December 31, 2009, our interest rate swaps consisted
    of instruments with a total notional amount of
    $1.85 billion. These consist of instruments with a notional
    amount of $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate
    and pay a variable rate. The remaining instruments consist of
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, we will net settle these contracts in September 2011, or
    sooner should we elect. The net settlement amount will be based
    upon us paying a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.99% and
    receiving a floating rate that is based upon the three-month
    LIBOR. The difference between the fixed and floating rate will
    be applied to the notional amount for the

30-year

period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041.
    The key terms of these contracts are presented in the following
    tables.

The fair values of our interest rate instruments are largely
    determined by estimates of the forward curves of the Federal
    Funds rate and LIBOR. At December 31, 2009, a 10% increase
    in these forward curves would have increased our net assets by
    approximately $46 million.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
    subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of
    such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional
    currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable
    exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues,
    expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange
    rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in
    the

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate would not materially impact our December 31,
    2009 balance sheet.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income,
    stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. We also
    have audited Devon Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Devon Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for these
    consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    contained in “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures”
    of Devon Energy Corporation’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements
    included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on control
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
    subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
    conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The more significant of such policies
    are discussed below.

Nature
    of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration,
    development and production, and the acquisition of properties.
    Such activities are concentrated in the following North American
    onshore geographic areas:

•

the Mid-Continent area of the central and southern United
    States, principally in north and east Texas, as well as Oklahoma;

•

the Permian Basin within Texas and New Mexico;

•

the Rocky Mountains area of the United States stretching from
    the Canadian border into northern New Mexico;

•

the onshore areas of the Gulf Coast, principally in south Texas
    and south Louisiana; and

•

the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan in
    Canada.

Devon also has offshore operations located in the Gulf of Mexico
    and certain countries outside North America, including
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. In November 2009, Devon announced
    plans to strategically reposition itself as a high-growth, North
    American onshore exploration and production company. As part of
    this strategic repositioning, Devon plans to bring forward the
    value of its offshore assets by divesting them. In 2008 and 2007
    prior to these plans, Devon sold its assets in Egypt and West
    Africa. These divestiture activities are described more fully in
    Note 18.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations that perform
    various activities to support the oil and gas operations of
    Devon and unrelated third parties. Such activities include
    marketing gas, crude oil and NGLs, as well as constructing and
    operating pipelines, storage and treating facilities and natural
    gas processing plants.

The accounts of Devon’s controlled subsidiaries are
    included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include the following:

•

estimates of proved reserves and related estimates of the
    present value of future net revenues;

•

the carrying value of oil and gas properties;

•

estimates of the fair value of reporting units and related
    assessment of goodwill for impairment;

•

asset retirement obligations;

•

income taxes;

•

derivative financial instruments;



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

obligations related to employee pension and postretirement
    benefits; and

•

legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Devon is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing
    business operations. Devon’s largest areas of risk exposure
    relate to commodity prices, interest rates and Canadian to
    U.S. dollar exchange rates. As discussed more fully below,
    Devon uses derivative instruments primarily to manage commodity
    price risk and interest rate risk. Besides these derivative
    instruments, Devon also had an embedded option derivative
    related to the fair value of its debentures exchangeable into
    shares of Chevron common stock. Devon ceased to have this option
    when the exchangeable debentures matured on August 15, 2008.

Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments
    with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production that
    hedge the future prices received. These instruments are used to
    manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil
    and gas price volatility. Devon’s derivative financial
    instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps and
    costless price collars. Under the terms of the price swaps,
    Devon will receive a fixed price for its production and pay a
    variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the
    basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two
    regional gas index prices and pays a variable differential on
    the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The
    price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged
    production. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside
    of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various
    collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the
    counterparty to the collars.

Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its
    exposure to interest rate volatility. Devon’s interest rate
    swaps include contracts in which Devon receives a fixed rate and
    pays a variable rate on a total notional amount. Devon also has
    forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting
    swaps, Devon will net settle these contracts in September 2011
    or sooner should Devon elect. The net settlement amount will be
    based upon Devon paying a fixed rate and receiving a floating
    rate that is based upon the three-month LIBOR. The difference
    between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the
    notional amount for the

30-year

period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
    such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If such criteria are met for
    fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is recorded in
    the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded
    for the change in fair value of the hedged item. Cash
    settlements with counterparties to Devon’s derivative
    financial instruments are also recorded in the statement of
    operations.

A derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment if Devon designates the instrument as such on the date
    the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a
    business combination or other transaction that includes
    derivative contracts. Additionally, Devon must document the
    relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking the instrument. Devon must also assess, both at the
    instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash
    flow of the hedged item. For derivative financial instruments
    held during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009,
    Devon chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify its
    derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
    changes in commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes
    itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the
    failure of the counterparty to perform



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this
    risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of
    counterparties whom Devon believes are minimal credit risks. It
    is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only
    with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management
    to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally,
    Devon’s derivative contracts generally require cash
    collateral to be posted if either its or the counterparty’s
    credit rating falls below investment grade. The

mark-to-market

exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted,
    decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment
    grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to
    $50 million for the majority of our contracts. As of
    December 31, 2009, the credit ratings of all Devon’s
    counterparties were investment grade.

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative financial
    instrument that results from a change in commodity prices,
    interest rates or other relevant underlyings. The market risks
    associated with commodity price and interest rate contracts are
    managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the
    types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. The oil
    and gas reference prices upon which the commodity instruments
    are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree
    of historical correlation with actual prices received by Devon.
    Devon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
    for speculative trading purposes.

See Note 3 for the amounts included in Devon’s
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
    statements of operations associated with its derivative
    financial instruments.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Certain of Devon’s assets and liabilities are measured at
    fair value at each reporting date. Fair value represents the
    price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to
    transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants. This is price is commonly referred to as the
    “exit price”.

Fair value measurements are classified according to a hierarchy
    that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques.
    This hierarchy consists of three broad levels. Level 1
    inputs on the hierarchy consist of unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the
    highest priority. Level 2 measurements are based on inputs
    other than quoted prices that are generally observable for the
    asset or liability. Common examples of Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and
    liabilities in markets not considered to be active. Level 3
    measurements have the lowest priority and are based upon inputs
    that are not observable from objective sources. The most common
    Level 3 fair value measurement is an internally developed
    cash flow model. Devon uses appropriate valuation techniques
    based on the available inputs to measure the fair values of its
    assets and liabilities. When available, Devon measures fair
    value using Level 1 inputs because they generally provide
    the most reliable evidence of fair value.

Discontinued
    Operations

As previously discussed, Devon is in the process of divesting
    its offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico and certain
    International locations outside North America and previously
    sold its assets in Africa in 2008 and 2007. As a result of these
    divestitures and planned divestitures, all amounts related to
    Devon’s International operations are classified as
    discontinued operations. The Gulf of Mexico properties being
    divested do not qualify as discontinued operations under
    accounting rules. As such, amounts included in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements and these notes that pertain
    to continuing operations include amounts related to Devon’s
    offshore Gulf of Mexico operations.

The captions assets held for sale and liabilities associated
    with assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets present the assets and liabilities associated
    with Devon’s discontinued operations. Devon measures its
    assets held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or
    estimated fair value less costs to



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

sell. Additionally, Devon does not recognize depreciation,
    depletion and amortization on its long-lived assets held for
    sale.

Property
    and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
    gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
    acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
    properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
    and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
    incurred that are directly identified with acquisition,
    exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for
    its own account, and that are not related to production, general
    corporate overhead or similar activities, are also capitalized.
    Interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas
    properties under current evaluation and major development
    projects of oil and gas properties are also capitalized. All
    costs related to production activities, including workover costs
    incurred solely to maintain or increase levels of production
    from an existing completion interval, are charged to expense as
    incurred.

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
    oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
    limitation is the estimated after-tax future net revenues,
    discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil, gas and NGL
    reserves plus the cost of properties not subject to
    amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude future cash
    outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations
    included in the net book value of oil and gas properties. Such
    limitations are imposed separately on a

country-by-country

basis and are tested quarterly.

Future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent
    the average of the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the

12-month

period prior to the end of the period. Costs included in future
    net revenues are determined in a similar manner. Prior to
    December 31, 2009, prices and costs used to calculate
    future net revenues were those as of the end of the appropriate
    quarterly period. Prices are held constant indefinitely and are
    not changed except where different prices are fixed and
    determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of
    those contracts, including derivative contracts in place that
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment. None of Devon’s
    derivative contracts held during the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2009 qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes,
    over the ceiling is written off as an expense. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Capitalized costs are depleted by an equivalent

unit-of-production

method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic
    feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is calculated using
    the capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement
    costs, plus the estimated future expenditures (based on current
    costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves, net of
    estimated salvage values.

Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the
    depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not
    proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Devon
    assesses its unproved properties for impairment quarterly.
    Significant unproved properties are assessed individually. Costs
    of insignificant unproved properties are transferred into the
    depletion calculation over average holding periods ranging from
    three years for onshore properties to seven years for offshore
    properties.

No gain or loss is recognized upon disposal of oil and gas
    properties unless such disposal significantly alters the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in a
    particular country.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a

unit-of-production

basis. Depreciation and amortization of other property and
    equipment, including corporate and other midstream assets and
    leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to
    39 years.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations
    associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing
    well sites, offshore production platforms, and midstream
    pipelines and processing plants when there is a legal obligation
    associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset
    retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair
    value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an
    increase to the associated property and equipment on the
    consolidated balance sheet. If the fair value of a recorded
    asset retirement obligation changes, a revision is recorded to
    both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement
    cost. The asset retirement cost is depreciated using a
    systematic and rational method similar to that used for the
    associated property and equipment.

Investments

Devon reports its investments and other marketable securities at
    fair value, except for debt securities in which management has
    the ability and intent to hold until maturity.

Devon’s primary investments consist of auction rate
    securities that totaled $115 million and $122 million
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    securities are rated AAA — the highest
    rating — by one or more rating agencies and are
    collateralized by student loans that are substantially
    guaranteed by the United States government. Although
    Devon’s auction rate securities generally have contractual
    maturities of more than 20 years, the underlying interest
    rates on such securities are scheduled to reset every seven to
    28 days. Therefore, these auction rate securities were
    generally priced and subsequently traded as short-term
    investments because of the interest rate reset feature.

Since February 8, 2008, Devon has experienced difficulty
    selling its securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism, which provided liquidity to these securities. An
    auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
    securities could not do so. The securities for which auctions
    have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned
    every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.

From February 2008, when auctions began failing, to
    December 31, 2009, issuers have redeemed $37 million
    of Devon’s auction rate securities holdings at par.
    However, based on continued auction failures and the current
    market for Devon’s auction rate securities, Devon has
    classified its auction rate securities as long-term investments
    as of December 31, 2009. These securities are included in
    other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet. Devon has the ability to hold the securities until
    maturity. At this time, Devon does not believe the values of its
    long-term securities are impaired.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
    quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
    reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
    estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
    comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.

Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
    fourth quarters of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Based on these
    assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
    assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    The increase in goodwill from 2008 to 2009 is due to changes in
    the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian
    dollar.

Foreign
    Currency Translation Adjustments

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devon’s
    consolidated operations except its Canadian subsidiaries, which
    use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore,
    the assets and liabilities of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated into U.S. dollars based on the current
    exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Canadian
    income and expenses are translated at average rates for the
    periods presented. Translation adjustments have no effect on net
    income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income in stockholders’ equity. The following table
    presents the balances of Devon’s cumulative translation
    adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
    assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for environmental
    remediation or restoration claims are recorded when it is
    probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Expenditures related to such
    environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance
    with Devon’s accounting policy for property and equipment.
    Reference is made to Note 10 for a discussion of amounts
    recorded for these liabilities.

Revenue
    Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold
    to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the
    revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is transferred
    when production has been delivered to a pipeline, railcar or
    truck or a tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating
    to future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by governmental
    authorities on oil, gas and NGL revenues are presented
    separately from such revenues in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining
    reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced
    owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The
    liability is priced based on current market prices. No
    receivables are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken
    less than its share of production unless all revenue recognition
    criteria are met. If an imbalance exists at the time the
    wells’ reserves are depleted, settlements are made among
    the joint interest owners under a variety of arrangements.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
    products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
    fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the
    revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to gas
    and NGL purchase, transportation and processing contracts are
    reported on a gross basis when Devon takes title to the products
    and has risks and rewards of ownership.

Major
    Purchasers

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, no purchaser accounted for more than
    10% of Devon’s revenues from continuing operations.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
    reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
    properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
    pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Share
    Based Compensation

Devon grants stock options, restricted stock awards and other
    types of share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors
    and selected employees. All such awards are measured at fair
    value on the date of grant and are recognized as a component of
    general and administrative expenses or restructuring costs in
    the accompanying statements of operations over the applicable
    requisite service periods. Generally, Devon uses new shares to
    grant share-based awards and to issue shares upon stock option
    exercises.

Income
    Taxes

Devon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal
    and various state jurisdictions in the United States and by
    other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for
    deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions using the
    asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
    consequences attributable to differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized
    for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected
    utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and
    other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
    settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
    change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
    includes the enactment date.

Devon recognizes the financial statement effects of tax
    positions when it is more likely than not, based on the
    technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon
    examination by a taxing authority. Recognized tax positions are
    initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax
    benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits related to such tax positions are
    included in other long-term liabilities unless the tax position
    is expected to be settled within the upcoming year, in which
    case the liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other
    current liabilities. Interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense.
    Additional information regarding Devon’s unrecognized tax
    benefits, including changes in such amounts during 2009 and
    2008, is provided in Note 17.

Pursuant to the planned divestitures of its International assets
    located outside North America, Devon expects to repatriate the
    earnings from the foreign subsidiaries that own the assets. As a
    result, Devon has recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on
    its foreign earnings as of December 31, 2009.

Net
    (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share

Devon’s basic earnings per share amounts have been computed
    based on the average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding for the period. Basic earnings per share includes
    the effect of participating securities, which primarily consist
    of Devon’s outstanding restricted stock awards. Diluted
    earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method
    to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
    Devon’s dilutive outstanding stock options were exercised.

Statements
    of Cash Flows

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Devon
    considers all highly liquid investments with original
    contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents.

Credit
    Lines

Devon has a $2.65 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving
    line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The
    maturity date for $2.15 billion of the Senior Credit
    Facility is April 7, 2013. The maturity date for the
    remaining $0.5 billion is April 7, 2012. All amounts
    outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity
    dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the
    election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options
    for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally
    less than the prime rate. However, Devon may elect to borrow at
    the prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides
    for an annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable
    quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2009, there were
    no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.

Following the maturity of an unused $700 million short-term
    facility on November 3, 2009, Devon established a new
    $700 million

364-day,

syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the
    “Short-Term Facility”). The Short-Term Facility
    provides Devon with incremental liquidity for near-term capital
    expenditures.

The Short-Term Facility matures on November 2, 2010. On the
    maturity date, all amounts outstanding will be due and payable
    at that time. Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Facility
    bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to
    12 months. Such rates are generally based on LIBOR or the
    prime rate. The Short-Term Facility provides for an annual
    facility fee of approximately $1.75 million that is payable
    quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2009, there were
    no borrowings under the Short-Term Facility.

The Senior Credit Facility and Short-Term Facility contain only
    one material financial covenant. This covenant requires
    Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization
    to be less than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions
    of total funded debt and total capitalization that include
    adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the
    consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is
    adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full
    cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of
    December 31, 2009, Devon was in compliance with this
    covenant. Devon’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2009, as calculated pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, was 20.5%.

Devon also has access to short-term credit under its commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $2.85 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility or the Short-Term Facility on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index
    such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate
    as found on the commercial paper market. As of December 31,
    2009, Devon had $1.4 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at an average rate of 0.29%. The average borrowing
    rate for Devon’s $1.0 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 was 3.00%.

Ocean
    Debt

As a result of the merger with Ocean Energy, Inc., which closed

    The table below summarizes the debt assumed that remains
    outstanding, the fair value of the debt at April 25, 2003,
    and the effective interest rate of the debt assumed after
    determining the fair values of the respective notes using
    April 25, 2003, market interest rates. The premiums
    resulting from fair values exceeding face values are being
    amortized using the effective interest method. All of the notes
    are general unsecured obligations of Devon.

During 2009 and 2008, Devon recognized revisions to its asset
    retirement obligations totaling $33 million and
    $225 million, respectively. The primary factors causing the
    2009 fair value increase were an overall increase in abandonment
    cost estimates, partially offset by an increase in the discount
    rate used to calculate the present value of the obligations. The
    primary factors causing the 2008 fair value increase were an
    overall increase in abandonment cost estimates and a decrease in
    the discount rate used to present value the obligations. In
    addition, higher abandonment cost estimates related to certain
    offshore platforms that were destroyed by Hurricane Ike resulted
    in an $82 million increase in 2008. See additional
    discussion regarding this revision in Note 10 —
    Hurricane Contingencies.

8.

Retirement
    Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
    and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
    Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for U.S. and
    Canadian employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
    Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
    employees’ years of service and compensation and are funded
    from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

Devon’s funding policy regarding the Qualified Plans is to
    contribute the amount of funds necessary for the Qualified
    Plans’ assets to approximately equal the present value of
    benefits earned by the participants, as calculated in accordance
    with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair values of the
    Qualified Plans’ assets were $532 million and
    $430 million, respectively. The assets were
    $164 million less and $209 million less, respectively,
    than the related accumulated benefit obligation. The amount of
    contributions required during future periods will depend on
    investment returns from the plan assets during the same period
    as well as changes in long-term interest rates.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
    employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
    by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
    are based on the employees’ years of service and
    compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
    established trusts to fund these plans’ benefit
    obligations. The total value of these trusts was
    $39 million and $50 million at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively, and is included in noncurrent other
    assets in the consolidated



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

balance sheets. For the remaining Supplemental Plans for which
    trusts have not been established, benefits are funded from
    Devon’s available cash and cash equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
    (“Postretirement Plans”) that provide benefits for
    substantially all U.S. employees. The Postretirement Plans
    provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and
    are, depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
    non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
    Plans are estimated based on Devon’s future cost-sharing
    intentions. Devon’s funding policy for the Postretirement
    Plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with
    available cash and cash equivalents.

Benefit
    Obligations and Funded Status

The following table presents the status of Devon’s pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans for 2009 and 2008. The
    benefit obligation for pension plans represents the projected
    benefit obligation, while the benefit obligation for the
    postretirement benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit
    obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the
    projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no
    assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated
    benefit obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2009
    and 2008 was $873 million and $795 million,
    respectively. Devon’s benefit obligations and plan assets
    are measured each year as of December 31.

Discount rate

— Future pension and
    postretirement obligations are discounted at the end of each
    year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively
    settled, considering the timing of estimated future cash flows
    related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond
    yields, after allowing for call and default risk. High quality
    corporate bond yield indices, such as Moody’s Aa, are
    considered when selecting the discount rate.

Rate of compensation increase

— For measurement
    of the 2009 benefit obligation for the pension plans, the 6.95%
    compensation increase in the table above represents the assumed
    increase through 2011. The rate was assumed to decrease to 5% in
    the year 2012 and remain at that level thereafter.

Expected return on plan assets

— The expected
    rate of return on plan assets was determined by evaluating input
    from external consultants and economists as well as long-term
    inflation assumptions. Devon expects the long-term asset
    allocation to approximate the targeted allocation. Therefore,
    the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on
    the target allocation of investment types in such assets. See
    plan assets discussion below for more information on
    Devon’s target allocations.

Other assumptions

— For measurement of the 2009
    benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans,
    an 8.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered health care benefits was assumed for 2010. The rate was
    assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of 5% in the
    year 2029 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health
    care cost-trend rates affect the amounts reported for retiree
    health care costs. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
    health care cost-trend rates would have the following

Pension
    Plan Assets

Devon’s overall investment objective for its pension
    plans’ assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested
    capital and income to ensure benefit payments can be funded when
    required. To assist in achieving this objective, Devon has
    established certain investment strategies, including target
    allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments,
    designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing.

The vast majority of Devon’s plan assets are invested in
    diversified asset types to generate long-term growth and income.
    The remaining plan assets, generally less than 5%, are invested
    in assets that can be used for near-term benefit payments.
    Derivatives or other speculative investments considered high
    risk are generally prohibited.

At the end of 2009, Devon’s target allocations for plan
    assets are 47.5% for equity securities, 40% for fixed-income
    securities and 12.5% for other investment types. At the end of
    2008, Devon’s target allocation was 60% for equity
    securities and 40% for fixed income securities. The fair values
    of Devon’s pension assets at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, are presented by asset class in the following tables.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair values of the assets and liabilities in the tables above.

Equity securities

— Devon’s equity
    securities consist of investments in United States large and
    small capitalization companies and international large
    capitalization companies. These equity securities are actively
    traded securities that can be redeemed upon demand. The fair
    values of these Level 1 securities are based upon quoted
    market prices.

Devon’s equity securities also include commingled funds
    that invest in large capitalization companies. These equity
    securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively
    traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are
    based upon the net asset values provided by the investment
    managers.

Fixed-income securities

— Devon’s
    fixed-income securities consist of bonds issued by
    investment-grade companies from diverse industries, United
    States Treasury obligations and asset-backed securities.
    Devon’s fixed-income securities are actively traded
    securities that can be redeemed upon demand. The fair values of
    these Level 1 securities are based upon quoted market
    prices.

Other securities

— Devon’s other
    securities include commingled, short-term investment funds.
    These securities can be redeemed on demand but are not actively
    traded. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are
    based upon the net asset values provided by investment managers.

Devon’s other securities also include a hedge fund of funds
    that invests both long and short using a variety of investment
    strategies. Management of the hedge fund has the ability to
    shift investments from value to growth strategies, from small to
    large capitalization stocks, and from a net long position to a
    net short position. Devon’s hedge fund is not actively
    traded and Devon is subject to redemption restrictions with
    regards to this investment. The fair value of this Level 3
    investment represents the fair value as determined by the hedge
    fund manager.

Expected contributions included in the table above include
    amounts related to Devon’s Qualified Plans, Supplemental
    Plans and Postretirement Plans. Of the benefits expected to be
    paid in 2010, $7 million of pension benefits is expected to
    be funded from the trusts established for the Supplemental Plans
    and all $5 million of other postretirement benefits is
    expected to be funded from Devon’s available cash and cash
    equivalents. Expected employer contributions and benefit
    payments for other postretirement benefits are presented net of
    employee contributions.

Other
    Benefit Plans

Devon’s 401(k) Plan covers all its employees in the United
    States. At its discretion, Devon may match a certain percentage
    of the employees’ contributions to the plan. The matching
    percentage is determined annually by the Board of Directors.

In 2007, Devon adopted an enhanced defined contribution
    structure related to its 401(k) Plan effective January 1,
    2008. Participants who elected to participate in this enhanced
    defined contribution structure, as well as all employees hired
    on or after October 1, 2007, continue to receive a
    discretionary match of a percentage of their contributions to
    the 401(k) Plan. These participants also receive additional,
    nondiscretionary contributions by Devon calculated as a
    percentage of annual compensation. The percentage will vary
    based on the employees’ years of service.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
    employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee that is
    based upon the employee’s base compensation and
    classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
    amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
    has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
    plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
    employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
    percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
    additional Devon contributions.

Stockholders’
    Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of 1 billion
    shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and
    4.5 million shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per
    share. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series,
    and the terms and rights of such stock will be determined by the
    Board of Directors.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated 2.9 million
    shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock”). At December 31, 2009, there were no
    shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock issued or
    outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
    entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per share
    equal to the greater of $1.00 or 200 times the aggregate per
    share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends)
    declared on common stock since the immediately preceding
    quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first
    payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock are entitled to 200 votes per share (subject to adjustment
    to prevent dilution) on all matters submitted to a vote of the
    stockholders. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
    neither redeemable nor convertible. The Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but junior to
    all other classes of Preferred Stock.

Preferred
    Stock Redemption

On June 20, 2008, Devon redeemed all 1.5 million
    outstanding shares of its 6.49% Series A cumulative
    preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock was redeemed for
    cash at a redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends up to the redemption date.

Stock
    Repurchases

Devon’s Board of Directors previously approved an ongoing,
    annual stock repurchase program to minimize dilution resulting
    from restricted stock issued to, and options exercised by,
    employees. Also, Devon’s Board of Directors approved a
    program in 2007 to repurchase up to 50 million shares. This
    program was created as a potential use of the proceeds received
    from Devon’s West African property divestitures. Both of
    these plans expired on December 31, 2009, and no new plans
    have been authorized. Devon’s Board of Directors also
    approved a separate 50 million share repurchase program in
    August 2005, which expired on December 31, 2007.

During 2007 and 2008, Devon repurchased 10.6 million shares
    at a total cost of $1.0 billion, or an average of $93.76
    per share, under its repurchase programs. No shares were
    repurchased in 2009. The

    respectively. Devon paid dividends of $5 million in 2008
    and $10 million in 2007 to preferred stockholders. The
    decrease in preferred stock dividend in 2008 is due to the
    redemption of the preferred stock in the second quarter of 2008.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
    course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
    outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
    accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
    matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters
    and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
    similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management
    to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s
    financial position or results of operations after consideration
    of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ
    materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental
    Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
    environmental remediation activities associated with past
    operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes. In
    response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss
    accruals primarily consist of estimated uninsured costs
    associated with remediation. Devon’s monetary exposure for
    environmental matters is not expected to be material.

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including
    Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of
    the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the
    producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from
    federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. Devon does not
    currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with
    respect to such royalty matters.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act. The intent of this legislation was to
    encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico by
    providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain
    federal leases. Deep water leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) have contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or gas
    exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty relief would
    not be granted for that year.

In October 2007, a federal district court ruled in favor of a
    plaintiff who had challenged the legality of including price
    thresholds in deep water leases. Additionally, in January 2009 a
    federal appellate court upheld this district court ruling. This
    judgment was later appealed to the United States Supreme Court,
    which, in



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

October 2009, declined to review the appellate court’s
    ruling. The Supreme Court’s decision ended the MMS’s
    judicial course to enforce the price thresholds.

Prior to September 30, 2009, Devon had $84 million
    accrued for potential royalties on various deep water leases.
    Based upon the Supreme Court’s decision, Devon reduced to
    zero the $84 million loss contingency accrual in the third
    quarter of 2009. The $84 million expense reduction is
    included in other income in the accompanying 2009 consolidated
    statement of operations.

Hurricane
    Contingencies

Prior to September 1, 2006, Devon maintained a
    comprehensive insurance program that included coverage for
    physical damage to its offshore facilities caused by hurricanes.
    This program also included substantial business interruption
    coverage, which entitled Devon to be reimbursed for the portion
    of production suspended longer than forty-five days, subject to
    upper limits to oil and gas prices. Also, the terms of the
    historical insurance included a standard, per-event deductible
    of $1 million for offshore losses as well as a
    $15 million aggregate annual deductible.

Devon suffered insured damages in the third quarter of 2005
    related to hurricanes that struck the Gulf of Mexico. During
    2006 and 2007, Devon received $480 million as a full
    settlement of the amount due from its primary insurers and
    certain of its secondary insurers. During the fourth quarter of
    2008, Devon received $106 million as full settlement of the
    amount due from its remaining secondary insurers. Devon’s
    claims under its then existing insurance arrangements included
    both physical damages and business interruption claims. Devon
    used $424 million of these proceeds as reimbursement of
    repair costs and deductible amounts, resulting in excess
    recoveries. The $162 million of excess recoveries was
    recorded as other income in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations for 2008.

The policy underlying the insurance program terms described
    above expired on August 31, 2006. Due to significant
    changes in the insurance marketplace, Devon no longer has
    coverage for damage that may be caused by named windstorms in
    the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, Devon’s current insurance
    program includes coverage for physical damage and business
    interruption but does not have such coverage for damages or
    business interruption caused from named windstorms in the Gulf
    of Mexico.

During the third quarter of 2008, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav
    damaged certain of Devon’s oil and gas facilities and
    transportation systems in the Gulf of Mexico. These damages
    relate to both production operations that have been repaired and
    restored and production operations that will not be restored.
    These damages are uninsured losses because they resulted from
    named windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.

For the damaged facilities and transportation systems which have
    been repaired or restored, Devon recognized a loss of
    $31 million in 2008. This loss is included in lease
    operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of
    operations. The facilities for which Devon did not restore
    production operations consisted of certain platforms that were
    completely destroyed. Devon began performing asset retirement
    activities associated with the destroyed platforms and related
    wells in 2008. The time and effort required to complete such
    activities is expected to be significant due to the hazardous
    conditions created by the hurricanes. As a result, the estimated
    costs to complete the asset retirement activities were
    $82 million higher than Devon’s previously estimated
    asset retirement obligations related to the destroyed platforms
    and related wells. Therefore, in 2008, Devon increased its asset
    retirement obligations by $82 million with a corresponding
    increase to oil and gas property and equipment in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Other
    Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge,
    there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which
    Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Commitments

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under
    contractual agreements with third-party service providers to
    procure drilling rigs and other related services for
    developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities
    construction. Included in the $3.2 billion total of
    “Drilling and Facility Obligations” in the table below
    is $1.4 billion that relates to long-term contracts for
    three deepwater drilling rigs and certain other contracts for
    onshore drilling and facility obligations in which drilling or
    facilities construction has not commenced. The $1.4 billion
    represents the gross commitment under these contracts.
    Devon’s ultimate payment for these commitments will be
    reduced by any amounts billed to its partners until Devon sells
    the associated offshore properties. Payments for these
    commitments, net of amounts billed to partners, will be
    capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties.

Additionally, Devon’s commitment under these contracts may
    be further reduced if the buyers of its offshore assets assume
    all or a portion of the obligations. If the buyers do not assume
    these obligations, Devon will attempt to sublease the rigs to
    reduce its commitment. However, if the buyers do not assume the
    obligations and Devon is not able to sublease the rigs, Devon
    would be contractually committed to the amounts related to the
    remaining lease periods.

Devon has certain firm transportation agreements that represent
    “ship or pay” arrangements whereby Devon has committed
    to ship certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed
    transportation fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to
    aid the movement of its production to market. Devon expects to
    have sufficient production to utilize the majority of these
    transportation services.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
    lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
    administrative expenses under operating leases, net of

sub-lease

income, was $56 million, $44 million and
    $42 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003
    Ocean merger. The spars are being used in the development of the
    Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Boomvang
    field was divested as part of the 2005 property divestiture
    program. The Nansen operating lease is for a

20-year

term
    and contains various options whereby Devon may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spar. Total rental expense
    included in lease operating expenses under the Nansen operating
    lease was $12 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Devon has
    guaranteed that the Nansen spar will have a residual value at
    the end of the operating lease equal to at least 10% of the fair
    value of the spar at the inception of the lease. The total
    guaranteed value is $14 million in 2022. However, such
    amount may be reduced under the terms of the lease agreement. As
    a result of the sale of the Boomvang field, Devon is subleasing
    the Boomvang Spar. If the sublessee were to default on its
    obligation, Devon would continue to be obligated to pay the
    periodic lease payments and any guaranteed value required at the
    end of the term.

Devon has a floating, production, storage and offloading
    facility (“FPSO”) that is being used in the Panyu
    project offshore China and is being leased under operating lease
    arrangements. This lease expires in September 2018. Devon is
    also leasing an FPSO that is being used in the Polvo project
    offshore Brazil. This lease expires in 2014. Devon has also
    leased an FPSO that will be used when production from its
    Cascade development in the Gulf of Mexico begins in 2010. This
    lease expires in 2015. Total rental expense included in lease
    operating expenses for these FPSO’s was $36 million,
    $25 million and $17 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Devon expects the eventual buyers of these
    offshore assets will assume the FPSO leases. However, the
    amounts in the schedule below reflect its full commitments under
    the leases.

Includes $109 million and $98 million of asset
    retirement obligations related to Devon’s discontinued
    operations at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair values of the assets and liabilities in the tables above.

Level 1
    Fair Value Measurements

Debt

— The fair value of Devon’s
    variable-rate commercial paper borrowings is the carrying value.

Level 2
    Fair Value Measurements

Oil and gas price swaps, basis swaps and
    collars

— The fair values of the oil and gas price
    collars, gas swaps and gas basis swaps are estimated using
    internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward
    commodity price curves, quotes obtained from brokers for
    contracts with similar terms or quotes obtained from
    counterparties to the agreements. The most significant input to
    the cash flow calculations is Devon’s estimate of future
    commodity prices. Devon bases its estimate of future prices upon
    published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC
    Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West
    Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Another
    key input to the cash flow calculations is Devon’s estimate
    of volatility for these forward curves, which is based primarily
    upon implied



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

volatility. The resulting estimated future cash inflows or
    outflows over the lives of the contracts are discounted
    primarily using LIBOR and money market futures rates. These
    pricing and discounting inputs are sensitive to the period of
    the contract, as well as changes in forward prices and regional
    price differentials.

Interest rate swaps

— The fair values of the
    interest rate swaps are estimated using internal discounted cash
    flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves
    or quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements. The
    most significant input to Devon’s cash flow calculations is
    its estimate of future interest rate yields. Devon bases its
    estimate of future yields upon its own internal model that
    utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds
    Rate provided by third parties. The resulting estimated future
    cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are
    discounted primarily using LIBOR and money market futures rates.
    These yield and discounting inputs are sensitive to the period
    of the contract, as well as changes in forward interest rate
    yields.

Debt

— Devon’s fixed-rate debt instruments
    do not actively trade in an established market. The fair values
    of this debt are estimated by discounting the principal and
    interest payments at rates available for debt with similar terms
    and maturity.

Level 3
    Fair Value Measurements

Long-term investments

— Devon’s long-term
    investments presented in the tables above consisted entirely of
    auction rate securities. Due to the auction failures discussed
    in Note 1 and the lack of an active market for Devon’s
    auction rate securities, quoted market prices for these
    securities were not available as of December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008. Therefore, Devon used valuation
    techniques that rely on unobservable, or Level 3, inputs to
    estimate the fair values of its long-term auction rate
    securities. These inputs were based on the AAA credit rating of
    the securities, the probability of full repayment of the
    securities considering the United States government guarantees
    of substantially all of the underlying student loans, the
    collection of all accrued interest to date and continued
    receipts of principal at par. As a result of using these inputs,
    Devon concluded the estimated fair values of its long-term
    auction rate securities approximated the par values as of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. At this time,
    Devon does not believe the values of its long-term securities
    are impaired. The changes in these Level 3 assets during
    2008 and 2009 consisted entirely of redemptions of principal.

Asset retirement obligations

— The fair values
    of the asset retirement obligations are estimated using internal
    discounted cash flow calculations based upon Devon’s
    estimates of future retirement costs. Reconciliations of the
    beginning and ending balances of Devon’s asset retirement
    obligations, including revisions of the estimated fair values in
    2009 and 2008, are presented in Note 7.

12.

Share-Based
    Compensation

On June 3, 2009, Devon’s stockholders adopted the 2009
    Long-Term Incentive Plan, which expires on June 2, 2019.
    This plan authorizes the Compensation Committee, which consists
    of non-management members of Devon’s Board of Directors, to
    grant nonqualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock
    awards, Canadian restricted stock units, performance units,
    stock appreciation rights and cash-out rights to eligible
    employees. The plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified
    stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units
    and stock appreciation rights to directors. A total of
    21.5 million shares of Devon common stock have been
    reserved for issuance pursuant to the plan. To calculate shares
    issued under the plan, options granted represent one share and
    other awards represent 1.84 shares.

Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2005,
    2003 and 1997 under which stock options and restricted stock
    awards were issued to key management and professional employees.
    Options granted under these plans remain exercisable by the
    employees owning such options, but no new options or restricted



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has
    stock options outstanding that were assumed as part of the
    acquisitions of Ocean, Mitchell Energy & Development
    Corp. and Santa Fe Snyder.

With the approval of Devon’s Compensation Committee, Devon
    modified the share-based compensation arrangements for certain
    of Devon’s executives in the second quarter of 2008. The
    modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who
    meet certain

years-of-service

and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding
    share-based grants. As a condition to receiving the benefits of
    these modifications, the executives must agree not to use or
    disclose Devon’s confidential information and not to
    solicit Devon’s employees and customers. The executives are
    required to agree to these conditions at retirement and again in
    each subsequent year until all grants have vested.

Although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of
    the executives’ grants, it does accelerate the expense
    recognition as executives approach the

years-of-service

and age criteria. When the modification was made in the second
    quarter of 2008, certain executives had already met the

years-of-service

and age criteria. As a result, Devon recognized an additional
    $27 million of share-based compensation expense in the
    second quarter of 2008 related to this modification. This
    additional expense would have been recognized in future
    reporting periods if the modification had not been made and the
    executives continued their employment at Devon.

The following table presents the effects of share-based
    compensation included in Devon’s accompanying statement of
    operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007.

Stock
    Options

Under Devon’s 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options granted may not be less than the market
    value of the stock at the date of grant. In addition, options
    granted are exercisable during a period established for each
    grant, which may not exceed eight years from the date of grant.
    The recipient must pay the exercise price in cash or in common
    stock, or a combination thereof, at the time that the option is
    exercised. Options granted generally have a vesting period that
    ranges from three to four years.

The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed
    over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the fair
    values of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model, which requires Devon to make several
    assumptions. The volatility of Devon’s common stock is
    based on the historical volatility of the market price of
    Devon’s common stock over a period of time equal to the
    expected term of the option and ending on the grant date. The
    dividend yield is based on Devon’s historical and current
    yield in effect at the date of grant. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield for
    the expected term of the option at the date of grant. The
    expected term of the options is based on historical exercise and
    termination experience for various groups of employees and
    directors. Each group is determined based on the similarity of
    their historical exercise and termination behavior.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options that were

    $263 million and $151 million, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, Devon’s unrecognized compensation
    cost related to unvested stock options was $66 million.
    Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
    period of 2.6 years.

Restricted
    Stock Awards and Units

Under Devon’s 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, restricted
    stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions,
    restrictions and limitations, if any, that the Compensation
    Committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued
    employment. Generally, restricted stock awards and units vest
    over a minimum restriction period of at least three years from
    the date of grant. During the vesting period, recipients of
    restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject
    to restrictions or other limitations. The fair value of
    restricted stock awards and units on the date of grant is
    expensed over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the
    fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing
    price of Devon’s common stock on the grant date of the
    award or unit.

    cost related to unvested restricted stock awards and units was
    $316 million. Such cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.2 years.

13.

Restructuring
    Costs

In the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon recognized
    $153 million of estimated employee severance costs
    associated with the planned divestitures of its offshore assets
    that was announced in November 2009. This amount was based on
    estimates of the number of employees that will ultimately be
    impacted by the divestitures, and includes $63 million
    related to accelerated vesting of share-based grants. Of the
    $153 million total, $105 million relates to
    Devon’s U.S. Offshore operations and the remainder
    relates to its International discontinued operations.

As of the date these financial statements were prepared, only
    one of the properties Devon intends to sell had actually been
    sold. Furthermore, the vast majority of employees will not be
    impacted by the divestitures until the properties are sold.
    Therefore, Devon’s estimate of employee severance costs
    recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009 was based upon certain
    key estimates that could change as properties are sold. These
    estimates include the number of impacted employees, the number
    of employees offered comparable positions with the buyers and
    the date of separation for impacted employees.

14.

Other
    Financial Instruments

Until October 31, 2008, Devon owned 14.2 million
    shares of Chevron common stock. These shares were held in
    connection with debt owed by Devon that contained an exchange
    option. The exchange option allowed the debt holders, prior to
    the debt’s maturity of August 15, 2008, to exchange
    the debt for shares of Chevron common stock owned by Devon.
    However, Devon had the option to settle any exchanges with cash
    equal to the market value of Chevron common stock at the time of
    the exchange. Devon settled exchange requests during 2008 and
    2007 by paying $1.0 billion during 2008 and
    $0.2 billion during 2007. On October 31, 2008, Devon
    transferred its 14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock
    to Chevron. In exchange, Devon received Chevron’s interest
    in the Drunkard’s Wash coalbed natural gas field in
    east-central Utah and $280 million in cash.

The shares of Chevron common stock and the exchange option
    embedded in the debt were always recorded on Devon’s
    balance sheet at fair value. However, pursuant to accounting
    rules prior to January 1, 2007, only the change in fair
    value of the embedded option had historically been included in
    Devon’s results of operations. Conversely, the change in
    fair value of the Chevron common stock had not been included in
    Devon’s results of operations, but instead had been
    recorded directly to stockholders’ equity as part of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

“accumulated other comprehensive income.” Effective
    January 1, 2007, under new accounting rules, Devon elected
    to begin recognizing the change in fair value of the Chevron
    common stock in its results of operations. Accordingly,
    beginning with the first quarter of 2007, the change in fair
    value of the Chevron common stock owned by Devon, along with the
    change in fair value of the related exchange option, were both
    included in Devon’s results of operations. Also, as a
    result of this change, Devon reclassified $364 million of
    after-tax unrealized gains related to Devon’s investment in
    Chevron common stock from accumulated other comprehensive income
    to retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007.

The following table presents the changes in fair value and cash

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2009 and 2008, Devon reduced the carrying values of
    certain of its oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling

The 2009 reduction was recognized in the first quarter and the
    2008 reductions were recognized in the fourth quarter. The
    reductions resulted from significant decreases in each
    country’s full cost ceiling compared to the immediately
    preceding quarter. The lower United States ceiling value in the
    first quarter of 2009 largely resulted from the effects of
    declining natural gas prices subsequent to December 31,
    2008. The lower ceiling values in the fourth quarter of 2008
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil, gas
    and NGL prices compared to September 30, 2008.

During 2008, Devon repatriated $2.6 billion from certain
    foreign subsidiaries to the United States. Also in the second
    quarter of 2008, Devon made certain tax policy election changes
    to minimize the taxes Devon otherwise would pay for the cash
    repatriations, as well as the taxable gains associated with the
    sales of assets in West Africa. As a result of the
    repatriations, as well as the tax policy election changes, Devon
    recognized additional tax expense of $312 million during
    2008. Of the $312 million, $295 million was recognized
    as current income tax expense, and $17 million was
    recognized as deferred tax expense.

In 2007, deferred income taxes were reduced $261 million
    due to a Canadian statutory rate reduction that was enacted in
    that year.

DEVON

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
    $748 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
    2009. Included in total deferred tax assets is $11 million
    related to various carryforwards available to offset future
    income taxes. The carryforwards consist of $151 million of
    state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire primarily
    between 2010 and 2029. The tax benefits of carryforwards are
    recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the
    utilization of such carryforwards to be “more likely than
    not.” When the future utilization of some portion of the
    carryforwards is determined not to be “more likely than
    not,” a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the
    recorded tax benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the net operating loss
    carryforwards to be utilized between 2010 and 2014. Such
    expectation is based upon current estimates of taxable income
    during this period, considering limitations on the annual
    utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax regulations.
    Significant changes in such estimates caused by variables such
    as future oil and gas prices or capital expenditures could alter
    the timing of the eventual utilization of such carryforwards.
    There can be no assurance that Devon will generate any specific
    level of continuing taxable earnings. However, management
    believes that Devon’s future taxable income will more
    likely than not be sufficient to utilize substantially all its
    tax carryforwards prior to their expiration.

Unrecognized

Devon’s unrecognized tax benefit balance at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $35 million and
    $29 million of interest and penalties, respectively. If
    recognized, all of Devon’s unrecognized tax benefits as of
    December 31, 2009 would affect Devon’s effective
    income tax rate.

Included below is a summary of the tax years, by jurisdiction,
    that remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.

Certain statute of limitation expirations are scheduled to occur
    in the next twelve months. However, Devon is currently in
    various stages of the administrative review process for certain
    open tax years. In addition, Devon is currently subject to
    various income tax audits that have not reached the
    administrative review process. As a result, Devon cannot
    reasonably anticipate the extent that the liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the
    next twelve months.

    Operations

For the three-year period ended December 31, 2009,
    Devon’s discontinued operations include amounts related to
    its assets in Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and other minor
    International properties that it is in the process of divesting.

    operations included amounts related to its assets in Egypt and
    West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire,
    Gabon and other countries in the region, until they were sold.

Devon’s African sales generated total proceeds of
    $3.0 billion. The following table presents the gains on the

Reductions
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, Devon reduced the carrying values of
    certain of its oil and gas properties that are now held for
    sale. These reductions primarily resulted from full cost ceiling
    limitations. A summary of these reductions and additional
    discussion is provided below.

Brazil’s 2009 reduction resulted largely from an
    exploratory well drilled at the BM-BAR-3 block in the offshore
    Barreirinhas Basin. After drilling this well in the first
    quarter of 2009, Devon concluded that the well did not have
    adequate reserves for commercial viability. As a result, the
    seismic, leasehold and drilling costs associated with this well
    contributed to the reduction recognized in the first quarter of
    2009.

    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Brazil’s 2008 reduction was recognized in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and resulted primarily from a significant
    decrease in its full cost ceiling. The lower ceiling value
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil
    prices compared to previous quarter-end prices.

Based on unsuccessful drilling activities in Nigeria, Devon
    reduced the carrying value of its Nigerian oil and gas
    properties in 2007.

(Loss)
    Earnings Per Share

The following table reconciles earnings from continuing
    operations and common shares outstanding used in the
    calculations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for
    2009, 2008 and 2007. Because a net loss from continuing
    operations was incurred during 2009 and 2008, the dilutive
    shares produce an antidilutive net loss per share result.
    Therefore, the diluted loss per share from continuing operations
    reported in the accompanying 2009 and 2008 consolidated
    statements of operations are the same as the basic loss per
    share amounts.

Segment
    Information

Devon manages its operations through seven distinct operating
    segments, or divisions, which are defined primarily by
    geographic areas. For financial reporting purposes, Devon
    aggregates its United States divisions into one reporting
    segment due to the similar nature of the business. However,
    Devon’s Canadian and



DEVON

International divisions are reported as separate reporting
    segments primarily due to significant differences in the
    respective regulatory environments.

Devon’s segments are all primarily engaged in oil and gas
    producing activities, and certain information regarding such
    activities for each segment is included in Note 22.
    Following is certain financial information regarding

Pursuant to the full cost method of accounting, Devon
    capitalizes certain of its general and administrative expenses
    that are related to property acquisition, exploration and
    development activities. Such capitalized expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $332 million, $337 million and $277 million in
    the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Also, Devon
    capitalizes interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved
    oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and
    gas properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $74 million, $71 million and $48 million in the
    years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Results
    of Operations

    associated with Devon’s oil and gas producing activities,
    including general and administrative expenses directly related
    to such producing activities. They do not include any allocation
    of Devon’s interest costs or general corporate overhead

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    gas and oil. This rate is not necessarily indicative of the
    relationship of natural gas and oil prices. Natural gas liquids
    reserves are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SEC’s
    Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

At the end of 2009, Devon adopted the SEC’s

Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting

, as well as the
    conforming rule changes issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. Upon adoption, the two primary rule changes
    that impacted Devon’s year-end reserves estimates were
    those related to assumptions for pricing and reasonable
    certainty.

The SEC’s prior rules required proved reserve estimates to
    be calculated using prices as of the end of the period and held
    constant over the life of the reserves. The revised rules
    require reserves estimates to be calculated using an average of
    the

first-day-of-the-month

price for the preceding

12-month

period.

The revised rules amend the definition of proved reserves to
    permit the use of reliable technologies to establish the
    reasonable certainty of proved reserves. This revision includes
    provisions for establishing levels of lowest known hydrocarbons
    and highest known oil through reliable technology other than
    well penetrations. This revision also allows proved reserves to
    be claimed beyond development spacing areas that are immediately
    adjacent to developed spacing areas if economic producibility
    can be established with reasonable certainty based on reliable
    technologies. As a result of adopting these provisions of the
    new rules, Devon’s 2009 reserves increased approximately
    65 MMBoe, or 2%. This increase is included in the 2009
    extensions and discoveries total.

Price
    Revisions


— Reserves increased 177 MMBoe due to
    higher oil prices, partially offset by lower gas prices. The
    increase in oil reserves primarily related to Devon’s
    Jackfish thermal heavy oil reserves in Canada. At the end of
    2008, 331 MMBoe of reserves related to Jackfish were not
    considered proved. However, due to higher prices, these reserves
    were considered proved as of December 31, 2009.
    Significantly lower gas prices caused Devon’s reserves to
    decrease 116 MMBoe, which primarily related to its United
    States reserves.


— Due to significantly lower oil, gas and
    NGL prices as of December 31, 2008 compared to
    December 31, 2007, 487 MMBoe of reserves were not
    considered proved as of December 31, 2008. Of the
    487 MMBoe price revisions, 331 MMBoe related to
    Jackfish steam-assisted gravity drainage project in Canada.

The 487 MMBoe price revision also included 28 MMBoe
    related to Devon’s proved reserves in the Canadian province
    of Alberta. In December 2008, the provincial government of
    Alberta enacted a new royalty regime. The new regime for
    conventional oil, gas, NGL and heavy oil production was
    effective January 1, 2009. As a result of the newly enacted
    royalties, Devon’s proved reserves decreased as of
    December 31, 2008.

Revisions
    Other Than Price

The 2009 total revision included 48 MMBoe related to the
    Barnett Shale. The 2008 total included performance revisions of
    22 MMBoe in the Barnett Shale. The 2007 total included
    performance revisions of 39 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale,
    13 MMBoe at Jackfish and 13 MMBoe at Carthage.

Extensions
    and Discoveries


— Of the 458 MMBoe of 2009 extensions
    and discoveries, 204 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale
    area in Texas, 118 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 49 MMBoe
    related to the Cana-Woodford Shale area in western Oklahoma,
    14 MMBoe related to the Rocky Mountain area, 11 MMBoe
    related to Deepwater Production in the Gulf, 8 MMBoe
    related to the Carthage Conventional area in east Texas, and
    7 MMBoe related to the Haynesville Shale area in east Texas.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The 2009 extensions and discoveries included 371 MMBoe
    related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling
    activities, including 203 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale,
    118 MMBoe at Jackfish and 24 MMBoe at the
    Cana-Woodford Shale.


— Of the 546 MMBoe of 2008 extensions
    and discoveries, 252 MMBoe related to the Barnett Shale,
    101 MMBoe related to Jackfish, 44 MMBoe related to
    Carthage Conventional, 21 MMBoe related to the
    Cana-Woodford Shale, 19 MMBoe related to the Lloydminster
    heavy oil development in Canada and 17 MMBoe related to the
    Arkoma-Woodford Shale area in southeastern Oklahoma.

The 2008 extensions and discoveries included 420 MMBoe
    related to additions from Devon’s infill drilling
    activities, including 243 MMBoe at the Barnett Shale,
    101 MMBoe at Jackfish, 22 MMBoe at Carthage
    Conventional, 18 MMBoe at Lloydminster and 11 MMBoe at
    the Cana-Woodford Shale.


— Of the 314 MMBoe of 2007 extensions

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

The domestic reserves were evaluated by the independent
    petroleum consultants of LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and
    Ryder Scott Company, L.P. in each of the years presented. The
    Canadian reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum
    consultants of AJM Petroleum Consultants in each of the years
    presented.

Future cash inflows, development costs and production costs were

    were used to estimate Devon’s proved oil and gas reserves
    at the end of each year. For 2009, the prices averaged $47.80
    per barrel of oil, $3.12 per Mcf of gas and $22.78 per barrel of
    natural

gas liquids. Of the $10.9 billion of future development
    costs as of the end of 2009, $2.0 billion,
    $1.6 billion and $0.9 billion are estimated to be
    spent in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
    also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
    Included as part of the $10.9 billion of future development
    costs are $1.1 billion of future dismantlement, abandonment
    and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
    expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
    Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
    appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
    flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
    properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
    to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
    impact of future operations.

The principal changes in the standardized measure of discounted
    future net cash flows attributable to Devon’s proved
    reserves are as follows:

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
    that material information relating to Devon, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
    certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
    senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
    principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective
    as of December 31, 2009 to ensure that the information
    required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files
    or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for Devon, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision
    and with the participation of Devon’s management, including
    our principal executive and principal financial officers, Devon
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this
    evaluation under the COSO Framework, which was completed on
    February 18, 2010, management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
    firm who audited Devon’s consolidated financial statements
    as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, as stated
    in their report, which is included under “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2009 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.
