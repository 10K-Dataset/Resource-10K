PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries
    (“Devon”), is an independent energy company engaged
    primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and
    production, the transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the
    processing of natural gas. We own oil and gas properties
    principally in the United States and Canada and, to a lesser
    degree, various regions located outside North America, including
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. We also own properties in West
    Africa that we intend to sell in 2008. In addition to our oil
    and gas operations, we have marketing and midstream operations
    primarily in North America. These include marketing natural gas,
    crude oil and NGLs, and constructing and operating pipelines,
    storage and treating facilities and gas processing plants. A
    detailed description of our significant properties and
    associated 2007 developments can be found under
    “Item 2. Properties.”

We began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. In
    1988, our common stock began trading publicly on the American
    Stock Exchange under the symbol “DVN”. In October
    2004, we transferred our common stock listing to the New York
    Stock Exchange. Our principal and administrative offices are
    located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK

73102-8260

(telephone 405/235-3611).

Strategy

We have a two-pronged operating strategy. First, we invest the
    vast majority of our capital budget in low-risk exploitation and
    development projects on our extensive North American property
    base, which provides reliable and repeatable production and
    reserves additions. To supplement that low-risk part of our
    strategy, we also annually invest a measured amount of capital
    in high-impact, long cycle-time projects to replenish our
    development inventory for the future. The philosophy that
    underlies the execution of this strategy is to strive to
    increase value on a per share basis by:

•

building oil and gas reserves and production;

•

exercising capital discipline;

•

preserving financial flexibility;

•

maintaining a low unit-cost structure; and

•

improving performance through our marketing and midstream
    operations.

Development
    of Business

During 1988, we expanded our capital base with our first
    issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a
    substantial expansion program that has continued through the
    subsequent years. This expansion is attributable to both a
    focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of
    years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling
    program. We have increased our total proved reserves from
    8 MMBoe


at year-end 1987 to
    2,496 MMBoe


at year-end 2007.

During the same time period, we have grown proved reserves from
    0.66
    Boe


per diluted share at the end of 1987 to 5.56
    Boe


per diluted share at the end of 2007. This represents a compound
    annual growth rate of 11%. We have also increased production
    from 0.09
    Boe


per diluted share in 1987 to 0.50
    Boe


per diluted share in 2007, for a compound annual growth rate of
    9%. This per share growth is a direct result of successful
    execution of our strategic plan and other key transactions and
    events.


Excludes
    the effects of mergers in 1998 and 2000 that were accounted for
    as poolings of interests.


Excludes
    reserves in West Africa that are held for sale and classified as
    discontinued operations as of December 31, 2007.



We achieved a number of significant accomplishments in our
    operations during 2007, including those discussed below.

•

Drilling Success

— We drilled 2,440 wells
    with an overall 98% rate of success. As a result of our success
    with the drill-bit, our proved reserves increased 9% to reach a
    record of 2.5 billion Boe at year-end 2007. We added
    390 MMBoe of proved reserves during the year with
    extensions, discoveries and performance revisions, a total which
    was well in excess of the 224 MMBoe we produced during the
    year. Consistent with our two-pronged operating strategy, 92% of
    the wells we drilled were North American development wells.

•

Barnett Shale Growth

— We continue to retain
    our positions as the largest producer and largest lease holder
    in the Barnett Shale area of north Texas. We increased our
    production from the Barnett Shale area by 33% in 2007, exiting
    the year at 950 MMcfe per day net to our ownership
    interest. We drilled 539 wells in the Barnett Shale in
    2007, which included our 1,000th horizontal well. We have
    interests in nearly 3,200 producing wells in the Barnett Shale
    and hold approximately 727,000 net acres of Barnett Shale
    leases. At December 31, 2007, we had estimated proved
    reserves of 724 MMBoe in the Barnett Shale area.

•

U.S. Onshore Production and Reserves
    Growth

— Our U.S. onshore properties,
    including the Barnett Shale, the Groesbeck and Carthage areas in
    east Texas and the Washakie basin in Wyoming, showed strong
    production growth in 2007. These three areas, which accounted
    for a little over 60% of our U.S. onshore production, had
    production growth in 2007 of 19% compared to 2006.

In addition to production growth, our U.S. onshore
    properties also demonstrated measurable growth in proved
    reserves. U.S. onshore proved reserves grew 282 MMBoe
    due to extensions, discoveries and performance revisions. This
    was more than double our U.S. onshore production in 2007 of
    125 MMBoe. Our drilling activities increased our 2007
    U.S. onshore proved reserves by14% compared to the end of
    2006.

•

Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Development

— In
    2007, we continued to build off prior years’ successful
    drilling results with our deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration
    and development program. To date, we have drilled four discovery
    wells in the Lower Tertiary trend — Cascade in 2002
    (50% working interest), St. Malo in 2003 (22.5% working
    interest), Jack in 2004 (25% working interest) and Kaskida in
    2006 (20% working interest). These achievements, along with our
    2007 developments discussed below, support our positive view of
    the Lower Tertiary and demonstrate the potential of our
    high-impact exploration strategy on growth of long-term
    production, reserves and value.

Specific Gulf of Mexico developments in 2007 included the
    following:

•

We commenced production from the deepwater Merganser field. At
    the end of 2007, our combined production from the two Merganser
    natural gas wells was about 51 MMcf per day. We have a 50%
    working interest in the Merganser field, which produces into the
    Independence Hub.

•

We sanctioned Cascade for phase one development and awarded
    various service and facilities contracts for he project. We
    anticipate first production at Cascade in 2010.

•

We initiated the drilling of delineation wells at St. Malo,
    Jack, Kaskida and Mission Deep. We have a 50% working interest
    in Mission Deep, which is a Miocene discovery made in 2006.

•

We are participating in two Lower Tertiary exploratory wells
    that were initiated in 2007 — Chuck (29.5% working
    interest) and Green Bay (23% interest). The Chuck well has
    reached total depth and is being evaluated. Drilling of the
    Green Bay well toward its target objective continues.

•

Jackfish

— We completed construction and
    commenced steam injection at our 100%-owned Jackfish thermal
    heavy oil project in the Alberta oil sands. Oil production from
    Jackfish is expected to ramp up throughout 2008 toward a peak
    production target of 35,000 Bbls per day. Additionally, we
    began front-end engineering and design work on an extension of
    our Jackfish project. We hope to receive regulatory



approval and formally sanction this second phase in the middle
    of 2008. Like the first phase, this second phase of Jackfish is
    also expected to eventually produce 35,000 Bbls per day.

•

Lloydminster

— Also in Canada, we increased
    production from the Lloydminster oil play in Alberta by 40% to
    approximately 33,500 Boe per day. We drilled 429 wells at
    Lloydminster in 2007, which added 22 million Boe of proved
    reserves.

•

Polvo

— We completed construction and
    fabrication of the Polvo oil development project offshore Brazil
    and began producing oil from the first of ten planned wells.
    Polvo, located in the Campos basin, was discovered in 2004 and
    is our first operated development project in Brazil. We have a
    60% working interest in Polvo.

In November 2006 and January 2007, we announced plans to divest
    our operations in Egypt and West Africa, including Equatorial
    Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon and other countries in the
    region. Divesting these properties will allow us to redeploy our
    financial and intellectual capital to the significant growth
    opportunities we have developed onshore in North America and in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we will sharpen our
    focus in North America and concentrate our international
    operations in Brazil and China, where we have established
    competitive advantages.

In October 2007, we completed the sale of our operations in
    Egypt and received proceeds of $341 million. As a result of
    this sale, we recognized a $90 million after-tax gain in
    the fourth quarter of 2007. In November 2007, we announced an
    agreement to sell our operations in Gabon for
    $205.5 million. We are finalizing purchase and sales
    agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government
    approvals for the remaining properties in the West African
    divestiture package. We are optimistic we can complete these
    sales during the first half of 2008.

Pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations, the
    amounts in this document related to continuing operations for
    2007 and all prior years presented do not include amounts
    related to our operations in Egypt and West Africa.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographical Areas

Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
    our segments and geographical areas.

Oil,
    Natural Gas and NGL Marketing

The spot market for oil, gas and NGLs is subject to volatility
    as supply and demand factors fluctuate. As detailed below, we
    sell our production under both long-term (one year or more) or
    short-term (less than one year) agreements. Regardless of the
    term of the contract, the vast majority of our production is
    sold at variable or market sensitive prices.

Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging
    arrangements, fixed-price contracts or firm delivery commitments
    with a portion of our oil and gas production. These activities
    are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our
    exposure to price fluctuations. See “Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Oil
    Marketing

Our oil production is sold under both long-term (one year or
    more) and short-term (less than one year) agreements at prices
    negotiated with third parties. As of February 2008, all of our
    oil production is sold at variable or market-sensitive prices.

Natural
    Gas Marketing

Our gas production is also sold under both long-term and
    short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties.
    Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2008,
    approximately 81% of our natural gas production was sold under
    short-term contracts at variable or market-sensitive prices.
    These market-sensitive sales are referred to as “spot
    market” sales. Another 17% of our production was committed
    under various long-term



contracts, which dedicate the natural gas to a purchaser for an
    extended period of time but still at market sensitive prices.
    The remaining 2% of our gas production was sold under long-term
    fixed price contracts.

NGL
    Marketing

Our NGL production is sold under both long-term and short-term
    agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although
    exact percentages vary, as of February 2008, approximately 69%
    of our NGL production was sold under short-term contracts at
    variable or market-sensitive prices. The remaining NGL
    production is sold under long-term market-indexed contracts
    which are subject to market pricing variations.

Marketing
    and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations
    is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide
    such services by gathering, processing and marketing oil, gas
    and NGL production in a timely and efficient manner. Our most
    significant midstream asset is the Bridgeport processing plant
    and gathering system located in north Texas. These facilities
    serve not only our gas production from the Barnett Shale but
    also gas production of other producers in the area. Our
    midstream assets also include our 50% interest in the Access
    Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This pipeline system
    allows us to blend our Jackfish heavy oil production with
    condensate and then transport the combined product to the
    Edmonton area.

Our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by:

•

selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams
    processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for
    marketing, and

•

selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport
    pipelines and unrelated third-party pipelines.

Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily
    incurred from:

•

purchasing the gas streams entering our transport pipelines and
    plants;

•

purchasing fuel needed to operate our plants, compressors and
    related pipeline facilities;

•

purchasing third-party NGLs;

•

operating our plants, gathering systems and related
    facilities; and

•

transporting products on unrelated third-party pipelines.

Customers

We sell our gas production to a variety of customers including
    pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and
    local distribution companies. Gathering systems and interstate
    and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and
    deliveries.

The principal customers for our crude oil production are
    refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have
    pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event
    pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is
    trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities.

Our NGL production is primarily sold to customers engaged in
    petrochemical, refining and heavy oil blending activities.
    Pipelines, railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products
    to market.

No purchaser accounted for over 10% of our revenues in 2007,
    2006 or 2005.

Seasonal
    Nature of Business

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases
    during the summer months and increases during the winter months.
    Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes
    lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities,
    local distribution companies and industrial users utilize
    natural gas



storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter
    requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal
    demand fluctuations.

Government
    Regulation

The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of
    regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil
    and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review
    for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to this legislation,
    numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and
    regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
    individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
    for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a
    significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production and
    marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations
    increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
    profitability. Because new legislation affecting the oil and gas
    industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are
    frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict
    the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and
    regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these laws
    and regulations will affect our operations in a manner
    materially different than they would affect other oil and gas
    companies of similar size.

The following are significant areas of government control and
    regulation in the United States, Canada and other international
    locations in which we operate.

Exploration
    and Production Regulation

Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal,
    state, provincial, local and international laws and regulations,
    including regulations related to the acquisition of seismic
    data; the location of wells; drilling and casing of wells; well
    production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation,
    storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil
    and gas operations; surface usage and the restoration of
    properties upon which wells have been drilled; the calculation
    and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes; the
    plugging and abandoning of wells; the transportation of
    production; and, in international operations, minimum
    investments in the country of operations.

Our operations are also subject to conservation regulations,
    including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing
    units or proration units; the number of wells that may be
    drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable from oil and
    natural gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and
    natural gas properties. In the United States, some states allow
    the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate
    exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of
    lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil
    and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws
    generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose
    certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of
    production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the
    amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and
    to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can
    drill.

Certain of our U.S. oil and natural gas leases are granted
    by the federal government and administered by various federal
    agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and the
    Minerals Management Service (“MMS”) of the Department
    of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed
    federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other
    matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these
    leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to
    the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in
    recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new
    rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and
    royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands.
    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also has jurisdiction
    over certain U.S. offshore activities pursuant to the Outer
    Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Royalties
    and Incentives in Canada

The royalty system in Canada is a significant factor in the
    profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties
    payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are
    determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties
    are determined by government regulation and are generally
    calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production,
    with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed



reference prices, well productivity, geographical location,
    field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum
    product produced. From time to time, the federal and provincial
    governments of Canada have also established incentive programs
    such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays and tax
    credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration
    or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have
    the effect of increasing our revenues, earnings and cash flow.

On October 25, 2007, the provincial government of Alberta
    announced a new royalty regime. The new regime contemplates the
    introduction of new royalties for conventional oil, natural gas,
    NGL and bitumen production effective January 1, 2009. The
    royalties will be linked to price and production levels and will
    apply to both new and existing conventional oil and gas
    activities and oil sands projects.

The implementation of the proposed changes to the royalty regime
    in Alberta is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The
    significant changes to the royalty regime require new
    legislation, changes to the existing legislation and regulation
    and development of proprietary software to support the
    calculation and collection of royalties. Additionally, certain
    proposed changes contemplate further public

and/or

industry consultation. Finally, the proposed royalty structure
    may be modified prior to its implementation.

We believe this proposal would reduce future earnings and cash
    flows from our oil and gas properties located in Alberta.
    Additionally, assuming all other factors are equal, higher
    royalty rates would likely result in lower levels of capital
    investment in Alberta relative to our other areas of operations.
    However, the magnitude of the potential impact, which will
    depend on the final form of enacted legislation and other
    factors that impact the relative expected economic returns of
    capital projects, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Pricing
    and Marketing in Canada

Any oil or natural gas export to be made pursuant to an export
    contract of a certain duration or covering a certain quantity
    requires an exporter to obtain an export permit from
    Canada’s National Energy Board (“NEB”). The
    governments of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also
    regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from
    those provinces for consumption elsewhere.

Investment
    Canada Act

The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada
    approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a
    Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by
    Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural
    resource properties may be considered to be a transaction
    requiring such approval.

Production
    Sharing Contracts

Many of our international licenses are governed by production
    sharing contracts (“PSCs”) between the concessionaires
    and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that
    define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue
    sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries.
    Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms
    and time limits of generally 30 years. PSCs also generally
    contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. As a result,
    at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of
    return, PSCs generally allow the government agency to retain
    higher fractions of revenue.

Environmental
    and Occupational Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and
    international laws and regulations concerning occupational
    safety and health as well as the discharge of materials into,
    and the protection of, the environment. Environmental laws and
    regulations relate to, among other things, assessing the
    environmental impact of seismic acquisition, drilling or
    construction activities; the generation, storage, transportation
    and disposal of waste materials; the monitoring, abandonment,
    reclamation and remediation of well and other sites, including
    sites of former operations; and the development of emergency
    response and spill contingency plans.



The application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000
    governing Environmental Management Systems, is required to be
    implemented for some international oil and gas operations.

In 1997, numerous countries participated in an international
    conference under the United Nations Framework Convention on
    Climate Change and adopted an agreement known as the Kyoto
    Protocol (the “Protocol”). The Protocol became
    effective February 16, 2005, and requires reductions of
    certain emissions that contribute to atmospheric levels of
    greenhouse gases (“GHG”). Certain countries in which
    we operate (but not the United States) have ratified the
    Protocol. Pursuant to its ratification of the Protocol in April
    2007, the federal government of Canada released its Regulatory
    Framework for Air Emissions, a plan to implement mandatory
    reductions in GHG emissions by way of regulation under existing
    legislation. The mandatory reductions on GHG emissions will
    create additional costs for the Canadian oil and gas industry.
    Certain provinces in Canada have also implemented legislation
    and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, which will also have a
    cost associated with compliance. Presently, it is not possible
    to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with
    any laws or regulations developed to achieve emissions
    reductions in Canada or elsewhere, but such expenditures could
    be substantial.

In 2006, we published our Corporate Climate Change Position and
    Strategy. Key components of the strategy include initiation of
    energy efficiency measures, tracking emerging climate change
    legislation and publication of a corporate GHG emission
    inventory, which occurred in January 2008. All provisions of the
    strategy are completed or are in progress.

We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and
    health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our
    business. With the efforts of our Environmental, Health and
    Safety Department, we have been able to plan for and comply with
    environmental and safety and health initiatives without
    materially altering our operating strategy. We anticipate making
    increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a
    result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the
    protection of the environment. While our unreimbursed
    expenditures in 2007 concerning such matters were immaterial, we
    cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our
    future exposure concerning such matters.

We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to
    limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial
    environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and
    accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances.
    However, we do not maintain 100% coverage concerning any
    environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect
    to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a
    violation of law.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    5,000 employees. We consider labor relations with our
    employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages
    or strikes pertaining to our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in
    general, are subject to a variety of risks. If any of the
    following risk factors should occur, our profitability,
    financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted.
    As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of
    their investment in Devon.

Oil,
    Natural Gas and NGL Prices are Volatile

Our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and
    demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. A significant downward
    movement of the prices for these commodities could have a
    material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves,
    revenues and operating cash flows, as well as the level of
    planned drilling activities. Such a downward price movement
    could also have a material adverse effect on our profitability,
    the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and future
    growth. Historically, prices have been volatile and are likely
    to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors
    beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited
    to:

•

consumer demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;

•

conservation efforts;

•

OPEC production levels;

•

weather;

•

regional market pricing differences;

•

differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus
    heavy or sour crude) and Btu content of gas produced;

•

the level of imports and exports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels;

•

the overall economic environment; and

•

governmental regulations and taxes.

Estimates
    of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
    geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir,
    particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of
    judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop
    different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue
    based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a
    given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result
    of several factors including additional development activity,
    the viability of production under varying economic conditions
    and variations in production levels and associated costs.
    Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates
    may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such
    revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse
    effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our
    financial condition and profitability. Additional discussion of
    our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is
    described in “Item 2. Properties — Proved
    Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue.”

Discoveries
    or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a
    Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally
    declines as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
    production costs generally increase, due to decreasing reservoir
    pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved
    reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline
    materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful
    exploration and development activities or, through engineering
    studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells,
    secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves, or
    acquire additional properties containing proved reserves.
    Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL



production and related per unit production costs are highly
    dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring
    additional reserves.

Future
    Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve
    Substantial Costs

Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire
    properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are
    subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not
    encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The
    costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In
    addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling
    operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions;

•

lack of access to pipelines or other methods of transportation;

•

environmental hazards or liabilities; and

•

shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.

A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in
    a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular
    property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful
    in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an
    adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
    condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling
    activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves
    greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently performing
    exploratory drilling activities in certain international
    countries. We have been granted drilling concessions in these
    countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur
    capital expenditures. Even if future drilling activities are
    unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves, we will likely be
    required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital
    expenditures.

Industry
    Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be
    Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent
    oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases
    and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel
    required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
    is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Higher
    recent commodity prices have increased drilling and operating
    costs. Higher prices have also increased the costs of properties
    available for acquisition, and there are a greater number of
    publicly traded companies and private-equity firms with the
    financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Certain
    of our competitors have financial and other resources
    substantially larger than ours, and they have also established
    strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental
    relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a
    consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding
    for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors
    may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that
    affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as
    changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and
    availability of alternative fuels and the application of
    government regulations.



International
    Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic and Other
    Risks

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. We also have operations in various
    countries in West Africa that we intend to sell in 2008. In
    these areas outside of North America, we face political and
    economic risks and other uncertainties that are more prevalent
    than what exist for our operations in North America. Such
    factors include, but are not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental
    agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
    overall business and results of operations by distracting
    management’s attention from our more significant assets.
    Various regions of the world have a history of political and
    economic instability. This instability could result in new
    governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in
    a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment.
    In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of
    contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This
    could adversely affect our interests and our future
    profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

Government
    Laws and Regulations Can Change

Our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in
    the United States, Canada and the other countries in which we
    operate. In addition, we are also subject to the laws and
    regulations of various states, provinces and local governments.
    Pursuant to such legislation, numerous government departments
    and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding
    on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of
    which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Changes
    in such legislation have affected, and at times in the future
    could affect, our operations. Political developments can
    restrict production levels, enact price controls, change
    environmental protection requirements, and increase taxes,
    royalties and other amounts payable to governments or
    governmental agencies. Although we are unable to predict changes
    to existing laws and regulations, such changes could
    significantly impact our profitability. While such legislation
    can change at



any time in the future, those laws and regulations outside North
    America to which we are subject generally include greater risk
    of unforeseen change.

Environmental
    Matters and Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and
    international laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us
    for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from our operations in affected areas. Any future
    environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the
    environment are uncertain and will be governed by several
    factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.
    There is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or
    regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not
    have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Insurance
    Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration, development, production and processing of oil,
    natural gas and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen
    occurrences such as hurricanes, blowouts, cratering, fires and
    loss of well control. These occurrences can result in damage to
    or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to
    persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment.
    We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in
    accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that
    management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against
    all operational risks is not available to us. Due to changes in
    the insurance marketplace following the 2005 hurricanes in the
    Gulf of Mexico, we currently have only a

de minimis

amount of coverage for any damage that may be caused by
    future named windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.

Our
    Short-Term Investments Are Subject To Risks Which May Affect
    Their Liquidity and Value

To maximize earnings on available cash balances, we periodically
    invest in securities that we consider to be short-term in nature
    and generally available for short-term liquidity needs. Such
    investments include asset-backed securities that have an auction
    rate reset feature (“auction rate securities”). Our
    auction rate securities are collateralized by student loans
    which are substantially guaranteed by the United States
    government, and generally have contractual maturities of more
    than 20 years. However, the underlying interest rates on
    such securities are scheduled to reset every 28 days.
    Therefore, these auction rate securities are generally priced
    and subsequently trade as short-term investments because of the
    interest rate reset feature.

At December 31, 2007, we held $372 million of auction
    rate securities. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we have
    reduced our auction rate securities holdings to
    $153 million. However, beginning on February 8, 2008,
    we experienced difficulty selling additional securities due to
    the failure of the auction mechanism which provides liquidity to
    these securities. An auction failure means that the parties
    wishing to sell securities could not do so. The securities for
    which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and
    be auctioned every 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.
    Accordingly, there may be no effective mechanism for selling
    these securities.

All of our auction rate securities, including those subject to
    failed auctions, are currently rated AAA — the highest
    rating — by one or more rating agencies. However,
    these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,
    market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by
    continued problems in the global credit markets, including but
    not limited to, U.S. subprime mortgage defaults, writedowns
    by major financial institutions due to deteriorating values of
    their asset portfolios (including leveraged loans,
    collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps and other
    credit-linked products). These and other related factors have
    affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused
    credit and liquidity issues. If issuers are unable to
    successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings
    deteriorate, our ability to liquidate these securities and fully
    recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term
    may be limited. As a result, we may deem such investments to be
    long-term in nature and generally not available for short-term
    liquidity needs. Additionally, under such circumstances, we may
    record an impairment charge on these investments in the future.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of our properties consist of interests in
    developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage
    located in our core operating areas. These interests entitle us
    to drill for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from specific
    areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests
    and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net
    profits interests, foreign government concessions and other
    forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and
    NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant
    midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region
    in north Texas. These assets include approximately
    2,700 miles of pipeline, two gas processing plants with
    750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a 15 MBbls per
    day NGL fractionator. To support our production in the Woodford
    Shale, located in southeast Oklahoma, we plan to bring online a
    200 MMcf per day gas processing plant in 2008.

Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline
    transportation system in Canada. This

220-mile

dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in
    northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal in
    Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the
    Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the
    combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market. We have a 50%
    ownership interest in the Access Pipeline.

Proved
    Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated
    quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological
    and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of
    the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of
    changes in existing prices provided only by contractual
    arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
    conditions.

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment as discussed in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As a result, we have
    developed internal policies for estimating and recording
    reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved
    reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
    guidance, and assign responsibilities for compliance in reserves
    bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the
    “Group”). Our policies also require that reserve
    estimates be made by qualified reserves estimators
    (“QREs”), as defined by the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers’ standards. A list of our QREs is kept by the
    Senior Advisor — Corporate Reserves. All QREs are
    required to receive education covering the fundamentals of SEC
    proved reserves assignments.

The Group is responsible for the internal review and
    certification of reserves estimates and includes the
    Manager — Reserves and Economics and the Senior
    Advisor — Corporate Reserves. The Group reports
    independently of any of our operating divisions. The Vice
    President — Strategic Planning is directly responsible
    for overseeing the Group and reports to our President. No
    portion of the Group’s compensation is directly dependent
    on the quantity of reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
    operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
    reserves that are audited include major fields and major
    additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group
    reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum
    consultants discussed below.

In addition to internal audits, we engage three independent
    petroleum consulting firms to both prepare and audit a
    significant portion of our proved reserves. Ryder Scott Company,
    L.P. prepared the 2007 reserves estimates for all our offshore
    Gulf of Mexico properties and for 99% of our International
    proved reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the
    2007 reserves estimates for 88% of our domestic onshore



properties. AJM Petroleum Consultants prepared estimates
    covering 34% of our 2007 Canadian reserves and audited an
    additional 51% of our Canadian reserves.

Set forth below is a summary of the reserves that were
    evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2007, 2006 and
    2005.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by our employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

In addition to conducting these internal and external reviews,
    we also have a Reserves Committee which consists of four
    independent members of our Board of Directors. Although we are
    not required to have a Reserves Committee, we established ours
    in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves
    estimation and certification process. The Reserves Committee was
    designed to assist the Board of Directors with its duties and
    responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved
    reserves, much like our Audit Committee assists the Board of
    Directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting
    requirements. Besides being independent, the members of our
    Reserves Committee also have educational backgrounds in geology
    or petroleum engineering, as well as experience relevant to the
    reserves estimation process.

The Reserves Committee meets at least twice a year to discuss
    reserves issues and policies, and periodically meets separately
    with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our
    independent petroleum consultants. The responsibilities of the
    Reserves Committee include the following:

•

perform an annual review and evaluation of our consolidated oil,
    gas and NGL reserves;

•

verify the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting
    system;

•

evaluate, prepare and disclose our compliance with legal and
    regulatory requirements related to our oil, gas and NGL reserves;

•

investigate and verify the qualifications and independence of

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of
    the relationship of gas and oil prices. NGL reserves are
    converted to Boe on a one-to-one basis with oil.





As presented in the previous table, we had 1,874 MMBoe of
    proved developed reserves at December 31, 2007. Proved
    developed reserves consist of proved developed producing
    reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The

No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or
    included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental
    authority or agency since the beginning of 2007 except in
    filings with the SEC and the Department of Energy
    (“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC
    correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein.
    Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same
    underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates
    of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires
    reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we
    operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not
    operate.

The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
    attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect
    market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to
    December 31, 2007. There can be no assurance that all of
    the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods
    indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that
    existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

Production,
    Revenue and Price History

Certain information concerning oil, natural gas and NGL
    production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding
    royalties and other third party interests) and operating
    expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2007, is
    set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Operation
    of Properties

The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the
    responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or
    operating agreements. The operator supervises production,
    maintains production records, employs field personnel and
    performs other functions.

We are the operator of 21,226 of our wells. As operator, we
    receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
    performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing
    and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
    in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the
    monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
    administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.



Organization
    Structure and Property Profiles

Our properties are located within the U.S. onshore and
    offshore regions, Canada, and certain locations outside North
    America. The following table presents proved reserve information
    for our significant properties as of December 31, 2007,
    along with their production volumes for the year 2007. Included
    in the table are certain U.S. offshore properties that
    currently have no proved reserves or production. Such properties
    are considered significant because they may be the source of
    significant future growth in proved reserves and production. The
    table does not include our West African operations that were
    classified as discontinued in 2007. Additional summary profile
    information for our significant properties is provided following

U.S.
    Onshore

Barnett Shale

— The Barnett Shale, located in
    north Texas, is our largest property both in terms of production
    and proved reserves. Our leases include approximately
    727,000 net acres located primarily in



Denton, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties. The Barnett
    Shale is a non-conventional reservoir and it produces natural
    gas and NGLs. We have an average working interest of greater
    than 90%. We drilled 539 gross wells in 2007 and expect to
    drill between 500 and 600 gross wells in 2008.

Carthage

— The Carthage area in east Texas
    includes primarily Harrison, Marion, Panola and Shelby counties.
    Our average working interest is about 85% and we hold
    approximately 131,000 net acres. Our Carthage area wells
    produce primarily natural gas and NGLs from conventional
    reservoirs. We drilled 152 gross wells in 2007 and plan to
    drill approximately 122 gross wells in 2008.

Permian Basin, Texas

— Our oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of west Texas comprise
    approximately 464,000 net acres located primarily in
    Andrews, Crane, Martin, Terry, Ward and Yoakum counties. These
    properties produce both oil and natural gas from conventional
    reservoirs. Our average working interest in these properties is
    about 40%. We drilled 77 gross wells in 2007 and plan to
    drill approximately 38 gross wells in the area in 2008.

Washakie

— Our Washakie area leases are
    concentrated in Carbon and Sweetwater counties in southern
    Wyoming. Our average working interest is about 76% and we hold
    about 157,000 net acres in the area. The Washakie wells
    produce primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs. In
    2007, we drilled 161 gross wells, and we plan to drill
    approximately 111 gross wells in 2008.

Groesbeck

— The Groesbeck area of east Texas
    includes portions of Freestone, Leon, Limestone and Robertson
    counties. Our average working interest is approximately 72% and
    we hold about 172,000 net acres of land. The Groesbeck
    wells produce primarily natural gas from conventional
    reservoirs. In 2007, we drilled 21 gross wells, and we
    anticipate drilling approximately 16 additional gross wells in
    2008.

Permian Basin, New Mexico

— Our Permian Basin
    properties in southeastern New Mexico produce conventional oil
    and natural gas. We hold about 286,000 net acres
    concentrated in Eddy and Lea counties and have an average
    working interest of about 75% in these properties. In 2007, we
    drilled 78 gross wells in this area, and we expect to drill
    approximately 94 gross wells in 2008.

U.S.
    Offshore

Deepwater Producing

— Our assets in the Gulf of
    Mexico include four significant producing
    properties —  Magnolia, Merganser, Nansen and Red Hawk
    — located in deep water (greater than 600 feet).
    We have a 50% working interest in these properties. They are
    located on federal leases and total approximately
    46,000 net acres. The properties produce both oil and
    natural gas.

Deepwater Development

— In addition to our four
    significant deepwater producing properties, we are in the
    process of developing our deepwater Cascade project discovered
    in 2002. Cascade is located on federal leases encompassing
    approximately 12,000 net acres. We have a 50% working
    interest in Cascade. In 2007, we sanctioned development plans
    and awarded various service and facility contracts including
    contracts for an FPSO and shuttle tankers. The first of two
    development wells is planned for 2008. Production from Cascade,
    which will be primarily oil, is expected to begin in 2010.

Deepwater Exploration

— Our exploration program
    in the Gulf of Mexico is focused primarily on deepwater
    opportunities. Our deepwater exploratory prospects include
    Miocene-aged objectives (five million to 24 million years)
    and older and deeper Lower Tertiary objectives. We hold federal
    leases comprising approximately one million net acres in our
    deepwater exploration inventory.

In 2006, a successful production test of the Jack
    No. 2 well provided evidence that our Lower Tertiary
    properties may be a source of meaningful future reserve and
    production growth. Through 2007, we have drilled four discovery
    wells in the Lower Tertiary. These include Cascade in 2002 (see
    “Deepwater Development” above), St. Malo in 2003, Jack
    in 2004 and Kaskida in 2006. We currently hold 194 blocks in the
    Lower Tertiary and we have identified 21 additional prospects to
    date.

At St. Malo, in which our working interest is 22.5%, we expect
    to complete two delineation wells in 2008. At Jack, where our
    working interest is 25%, we expect to complete a second
    appraisal well in early 2008. A second well (Cortez Bank) was
    drilled on the Kaskida unit in 2007 and other well operations
    are



planned for 2008. Our working interest in Kaskida is 20%, and we
    believe Kaskida is the largest of our four Lower Tertiary
    discoveries to date. The Kaskida discovery was our first in the
    Keathley Canyon deepwater lease area. Of our additional 21 Lower
    Tertiary exploration prospects we have identified, 15 are on our
    Keathley Canyon acreage.

Also in 2007, we participated in a delineation well on the
    Miocene-aged Mission Deep prospect in which we have a 50%
    working interest. We have identified 15 additional prospects in
    our deepwater Miocene inventory to date.

In total, we drilled one exploratory and one delineation well in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2007 and plan to drill between
    10 and 12 such wells in 2008. Our working interests in these
    exploratory opportunities range from 20% to 50%.

Canada

Jackfish

— We are currently developing our
    100%-owned Jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the
    non-conventional oil sands of east central Alberta. We are
    employing steam-assisted gravity drainage at Jackfish, and we
    began steam injection in the third quarter of 2007. Production
    is expected to ramp up throughout 2008 toward a peak production
    target of 35,000 Bbls per day . We hold approximately
    73,000 net acres in the entire Jackfish area, which can
    support expansion of the original project. We requested
    regulatory approval in late September 2006 to increase the scope
    and size of the original project. In 2007, we began front-end
    engineering and design work on this extension of the Jackfish
    project. We hope to receive regulatory approval and formally
    sanction this second phase in the middle of 2008. Like the first
    phase, this second phase of Jackfish is also expected to
    eventually produce 35,000 Bbls per day of heavy oil
    production.

Lloydminster

— Our Lloydminster properties are
    located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and
    western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by
    conventional means without steam injection. We hold
    2.1 million net acres and have a 97% average working
    interest in our Lloydminster properties. In 2007, we drilled
    429 gross wells in the area and plan to drill approximately
    475 gross wells in 2008.

Deep Basin

— Our properties in Canada’s
    Deep Basin include portions of west central Alberta and east
    central British Columbia. We hold approximately 609,000 net
    acres in the Deep Basin. The area produces primarily natural gas
    and natural gas liquids from conventional reservoirs. Our
    average working interest in the Deep Basin is 45%. In 2007, we
    drilled 41 gross wells and plan to drill approximately
    49 gross wells in the area in 2008.

Peace River Arch

— The Peace River Arch is
    located in west central Alberta. We hold approximately
    494,000 net acres in the area, which produces primarily
    natural gas and NGLs from conventional reservoirs. Our average
    working interest in the area is approximately 70%. We drilled
    60 gross wells in the Peace River Arch in 2007, and we
    expect to drill approximately 65 additional gross wells in 2008.

Northeast British Columbia

— Our northeast
    British Columbia properties are located primarily in
    British Columbia and to a lesser extent in northwestern
    Alberta. We hold approximately 1.2 million net acres in the
    area. These properties produce principally natural gas from
    conventional reservoirs. We hold a 72% average working interest
    in these properties. We drilled 64 gross wells in the area
    in 2007, and we plan to drill approximately 37 gross wells
    in 2008.

International

Azerbaijan

— Outside North America,
    Devon’s largest international property in terms of proved
    reserves is the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (“ACG”) oil
    field located offshore Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea. ACG
    produces crude oil from conventional reservoirs. We hold
    approximately 6,000 net acres in the ACG field and have a
    5.6% working interest. In 2007, we participated in drilling
    11 gross wells, and we expect to drill approximately
    16 gross wells in 2008.



China

— Our production in China is from the
    Panyu development in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South
    China Sea. Panyu fields produce oil from conventional
    reservoirs. In addition to Panyu, which is located on
    Block 15/34, we hold leases in four exploratory blocks
    offshore China. In total, we have 7.9 million net acres
    under lease in China. We have a 24.5% working interest at Panyu
    and 100% working interests in the exploratory blocks. We drilled
    three gross wells in China in 2007, all in the Panyu field. In
    2008, we expect to drill approximately six gross wells in the
    Panyu field, one exploratory well on Block 42/05 and one
    exploratory well on Block 11/34.

Brazil

— We commenced oil production in Brazil
    from our Polvo development area in 2007. Polvo, which we operate
    with a 60% interest, is located offshore in the Campos Basin in
    Block BM-C-8. In addition to our development project at Polvo,
    we hold acreage in eight exploratory blocks. In aggregate, we
    have 793,000 net acres in Brazil. Our working interests
    range from 18% to 100% in these blocks. We drilled three gross
    wells in Brazil in 2007 and plan to drill approximately eight
    gross wells in 2008.

Title to
    Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
    customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
    not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We
    believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the
    value of such properties or from the respective interests
    therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
    of the business.

As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
    of local records, little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
    Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of
    outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an
    acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of
    drilling operations on undeveloped properties.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including us, have
    been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal
    False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and
    related parties used below-market prices, improper deductions,
    improper measurement techniques and transactions with
    affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from
    federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The principal suit
    in which we are a defendant is

United States ex rel.
    Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al

. (the “Wright
    case”). The suit was originally filed in August 1996 in the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
    but was consolidated in October 2000 with other suits for
    pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for
    the District of Wyoming. On July 10, 2003, the District of
    Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to the Eastern District of
    Texas to resume proceedings. On April 12, 2007, the court
    entered a trial plan and scheduling order in which the case will
    proceed in phases. Two phases have been scheduled to date, with
    the first scheduled to begin in August 2008 and the second
    scheduled to begin in February 2009. We are not included in the
    groups of defendants selected for these first two phases. We
    believe that we have acted reasonably, have legitimate and
    strong defenses to all allegations in the suit, and have paid
    royalties in good faith. We do not currently believe that we are
    subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit
    and no related liability has been recorded in our consolidated
    financial statements.

Other
    Matters

We are involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the
    date of this report, there were no other material pending legal
    proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our
    property is subject.

Overview
    of Business

Devon is the largest U.S. based independent oil and gas
    producer and processor of natural gas and natural gas liquids in
    North America. Our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides
    stable production and a platform for future growth. Over
    90 percent of our production from continuing operations is
    from North America. We also operate in selected international
    areas, including Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. Our production
    mix in 2007 was 64 percent natural gas and 36 percent
    oil and NGLs such as propane, butane and ethane. We are
    currently producing 2.4 Bcf of natural gas each day, or
    about 3 percent of all the gas consumed in North America.

In managing our global operations, we have an operating strategy
    that is focused on creating and increasing value per share. Key
    elements of this strategy are replacing oil and gas reserves,
    growing production and exercising capital discipline. We must
    also control operating costs and manage commodity pricing risks
    to achieve long-term success.

•

Oil and gas reserve replacement

— Our financial
    condition and profitability are significantly affected by the
    amount of proved reserves we own. Oil and gas properties are our
    most significant assets, and the reserves that relate to such
    properties are key to our future success. To increase our proved
    reserves, we must replace quantities produced with additional
    reserves from successful exploration and development activities
    or property acquisitions.

•

Production growth

— Our profitability and
    operating cash flows are largely dependent on the amount of oil,
    gas and NGLs we produce. Growing production from existing
    properties is difficult because the rate of production from oil
    and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.
    As a result, we constantly drill for and develop reserves on
    properties that provide a balance of near-term and long-term
    production. In addition, we may acquire properties with proved
    reserves that we can develop and subsequently produce to help us
    meet our production goals.

•

Capital investment discipline

— Effectively
    deploying our resources into capital projects is key to
    maintaining and growing future production and oil and gas
    reserves. As a result, we deploy virtually all our available
    cash flow into capital projects. Therefore, maintaining a
    disciplined approach to investing in capital projects is
    important to our profitability and financial condition. Our
    ability to control capital expenditures can be affected by
    changes in commodity prices. During times of high commodity
    prices, drilling and related costs often escalate due to the
    effects of supply versus demand economics. Approximately 83% of
    our planned 2008 investment in capital projects is dedicated to
    a foundation of low-risk projects primarily in North America.
    The remainder of our capital is invested in high-impact projects
    primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and China. By deploying
    our capital in this manner, we are able to consistently deliver
    cost-efficient drill-bit growth and provide a strong source of
    cash flow while balancing short-term and long-term growth
    targets.

•

Operating cost controls

— To maintain our
    competitive position, we must control our lease operating costs
    and other production costs. As reservoirs are depleted and
    production rates decline, per unit production costs will
    generally increase and affect our profitability and operating
    cash flows. Similar to capital expenditures, our ability to
    control operating costs can be affected by significant increases
    in commodity prices. Our base North American production is
    focused in core areas of our operations where we can achieve
    economies of scale to help manage our operating costs.

•

Commodity pricing risks

— Our profitability is
    highly dependent on the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs.
    These prices are determined primarily by market conditions.
    Market conditions for these products have been, and will
    continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide economic
    activity, weather and other factors that are beyond our control.
    To manage this volatility, we will sometimes utilize financial
    hedging arrangements and fixed-price contracts. During 2007,
    approximately 5% of our gas production was subject to financial
    collar and swap contracts or fixed-price physical delivery
    contracts. Based on contracts in place as of February 15,
    2008, during 2008 approximately 64% of our gas production and
    12% of our oil production will be subject to financial collar
    and swap contracts or fixed-price physical delivery contracts.



Overview
    of 2007 Results and Outlook

2007 was Devon’s best year in its

20-year

history as a public company. We achieved key operational
    successes and continued to execute our strategy to increase
    value per share. As a result, we delivered record amounts for
    earnings, earnings per share and operating cash flow, and also
    grew proved reserves to a new all-time high. Key measures of our
    financial and operating performance for 2007, as well as certain
    operational developments, are summarized below:

•

Production grew 12% over 2006, to 224 million Boe

•

Net earnings rose 27%, reaching an all-time high of
    $3.6 billion

•

Diluted net earnings per share increased 26% to a record $8.00
    per diluted share

•

Net cash provided by operating activities reached
    $6.7 billion, representing a 11% increase over 2006

•

Estimated proved reserves reached a record amount of
    2.5 billion Boe

•

Discoveries, extensions and performance revisions added
    390 million Boe of proved reserves, or 17% of the
    beginning-of-year proved reserves

•

Capital expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development
    activities were $5.8 billion

•

The combined realized price for oil, gas and NGLs per Boe
    increased 6% to $42.96

•

Marketing and midstream operating profit climbed to a record
    $509 million

Operating costs increased due to the 12% growth in production,
    inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field
    services and the weakened U.S. dollar compared to the
    Canadian dollar. Per unit lease operating expenses increased 15%
    to $8.16 per Boe.

During 2007, we used $6.2 billion of cash flow from
    continuing operations along with other capital resources to fund
    $6.2 billion of capital expenditures, reduce debt
    obligations by $567 million, repurchase $326 million
    of our common stock and pay $259 million in dividends to
    our stockholders. We also ended the year with $1.7 billion
    of cash and short-term investments.

From an operational perspective, we completed another successful
    year with the drill-bit. We drilled 2,440 wells with an
    overall 98% rate of success. This success rate enabled us to
    increase our proved reserves by 9% to a record of
    2.5 billion Boe at the end of 2007. We added 390 MMBoe
    of proved reserves during the year with extensions, discoveries
    and performance revisions, which was well in excess of the
    224 MMBoe we produced during the year. Consistent with our
    two-pronged operating strategy, 92% of the wells we drilled were
    North American development wells.

Besides completing another successful year of drilling, we also
    had several other key operational achievements during 2007. In
    the Gulf of Mexico, we continued to build off prior years’
    successful drilling results with our deepwater exploration and
    development program. We commenced production from the Merganser
    field, and we also began drilling our first operated exploratory
    well in the Lower Tertiary trend of the Gulf of Mexico. We also
    made progress toward commercial development of our four previous
    discoveries in the Lower Tertiary trend.

At our 100%-owned Jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the
    Alberta oil sands, we completed construction and commenced steam
    injection. Oil production from Jackfish is expected to ramp up
    throughout 2008 toward a peak production target of
    35,000 Bbls per day. Additionally, we began front-end
    engineering and design work on an extension of our Jackfish
    project. Like the first phase, this second phase of Jackfish is
    also expected to eventually produce 35,000 Bbls per day.

Finally, we completed construction and fabrication of the Polvo
    oil development project offshore Brazil and began producing oil
    from the first of ten planned wells. Polvo, located in the
    Campos basin, was discovered in 2004 and is our first operated
    development project in Brazil.



In November 2006 and January 2007, we announced plans to divest
    our operations in Egypt and West Africa, including
    Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon and other countries
    in the region. Divesting these properties will allow us to
    redeploy our financial and intellectual capital to the
    significant growth opportunities we have developed onshore in
    North America and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Additionally,
    we will sharpen our focus in North America and concentrate our
    international operations in Brazil and China, where we have
    established competitive advantages.

In October 2007, we completed the sale of our operations in
    Egypt and received proceeds of $341 million. As a result of
    this sale, we recognized a $90 million after-tax gain in
    the fourth quarter of 2007. In November 2007, we announced an
    agreement to sell our operations in Gabon for
    $205.5 million. We are finalizing purchase and sales
    agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government
    approvals for the remaining properties in the West African
    divestiture package. We are optimistic we can complete these
    sales during the first half of 2008 and then primarily use the
    proceeds to repay our outstanding commercial paper and revolving
    credit facility borrowings and resume common stock repurchases.

Looking to 2008, we announced in February 2008 that we have
    hedged a meaningful portion of our expected 2008 production with
    financial price collar and swap arrangements. As of
    February 15, 2008, approximately 62% of our expected 2008
    gas production is subject to either price collars with a floor
    price of $7.50 per MMBtu and an average ceiling price of $9.43
    per MMBtu, or price swaps with an average price of $8.24 per
    MMBtu. Another 2% of our expected 2008 gas production is subject
    to fixed-price physical contracts. Also, as of February 15,
    2008, approximately 12% of our expected 2008 oil production is
    subject to price collars with a floor price of $70.00 per barrel
    and an average ceiling price of $140.23 per barrel.

Additionally, our operational accomplishments in recent years
    have laid the foundation for continued growth in future years,
    at competitive unit costs, which we expect will continue to
    create additional value for our investors. In 2008, we expect to
    deliver proved reserve additions of 390 to 410 million Boe
    with related capital expenditures in the range of $6.1 to
    $6.4 billion. We expect production to increase
    approximately 9% from 2007 to 2008, which reflects our
    significant reserve additions in recent years as well as those
    expected in 2008. Additionally, our exploration program exposes
    us to high-impact projects in North America and international
    locations that can fuel more growth in the years to come.

Oil
    Revenues

2007 vs. 2006

Oil revenues increased $700 million
    due to a 13 million barrel increase in production. The
    increase in our 2007 oil production was primarily due to our
    properties in Azerbaijan where we achieved payout of certain
    carried interests in the last half of 2006. This led to a nine
    million barrel increase in 2007 as compared to 2006. Production
    also increased 3.5 million barrels due to increased
    development activity in our



Lloydminster area in Canada. Also, oil sales from our Polvo
    field in Brazil began during the fourth quarter of 2007, which
    resulted in 0.5 million barrels of increased production.

Oil revenues increased $359 million as a result of a 11%
    increase in our realized price. The average NYMEX West Texas
    Intermediate index price increased 9% during the same time
    period, accounting for the majority of the increase.

2006 vs. 2005

Oil revenues decreased $155 million
    due to a four million barrel decrease in production. Production
    lost from properties divested in 2005 caused a decrease of four
    million barrels, and production declines related to our
    U.S. and Canadian properties caused a decrease of three
    million barrels. These decreases were partially offset by a
    three million barrel increase from reaching payout of certain
    carried interests in Azerbaijan.

Oil revenues increased $795 million as a result of a 49%
    increase in our realized price. The expiration of oil hedges at
    the end of 2005 and a 17% increase in the average NYMEX West
    Texas Intermediate index price caused the increase in our
    realized oil price.

Gas
    Revenues

2007 vs. 2006

A 55 Bcf increase in production caused
    gas revenues to increase by $329 million. Our drilling and
    development program in the Barnett Shale field in north Texas
    contributed 53 Bcf to the gas production increase. The June
    2006 Chief Holdings LLC (“Chief”) acquisition also
    contributed 12 Bcf of increased production. During 2007, we
    also began first production from the Merganser field in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in seven Bcf of
    increased production. These increases and the effects of new
    drilling and development in our other North American properties
    were partially offset by natural production declines primarily
    in Canada.

A 1% decline in our average realized price caused gas revenues
    to decrease $78 million in 2007.

2006 vs. 2005

An 11 Bcf decrease in production
    caused gas revenues to decrease by $77 million. Production
    lost from the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of
    35 Bcf. As a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Dennis and
    Ivan which occurred in 2005, gas volumes suspended in 2006 were
    three Bcf more than those suspended in 2005. These decreases
    were partially offset by the June 2006 Chief acquisition, which
    contributed 10 Bcf of production during the last half of
    2006, and additional production from new drilling and
    development in our U.S. onshore and offshore properties.

A 14% decline in average prices caused gas revenues to decrease
    $772 million in 2006. The 2005 average gas price was
    impacted by the supply disruptions caused by that year’s
    hurricanes.

Marketing

2007 vs. 2006

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
    $64 million, while operating costs and expenses decreased
    $9 million, causing operating profit to increase
    $73 million. Revenues increased primarily due to higher
    prices realized on NGL sales.

2006 vs. 2005

Marketing and midstream revenues decreased
    $120 million, and operating costs and expenses also
    decreased $106 million, causing operating profit to
    decrease $14 million. Both revenues and expenses in 2006
    decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, partially
    offset by the effect of higher gas pipeline throughout.

    table.

Lease
    Operating Expenses (“LOE”)

2007 vs. 2006

LOE increased $403 million in 2007.
    The largest contributor to this increase was our 12% growth in
    production, which caused an increase of $168 million.
    Another key contributor to the LOE increase was the continued
    effects of inflationary pressure driven by increased competition
    for field services. Increased demand for these services continue
    to drive costs higher for materials, equipment and personnel
    used in both recurring activities as well as well-workover
    projects. Furthermore, changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. and Canadian dollar also caused LOE to increase
    $40 million.

2006 vs. 2005

LOE increased $181 million in 2006
    largely due to higher commodity prices. Commodity price
    increases in 2005 and the first half of 2006 contributed to
    industry-wide inflationary pressures on materials and personnel
    costs. Additionally, the availability of higher commodity prices
    contributed to our decision to perform more well workovers and
    maintenance projects to maintain or improve production volumes.
    Commodity price increases also caused operating costs such as ad
    valorem taxes, power and fuel costs to rise.

A higher Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2006
    caused LOE to increase $34 million. LOE also increased
    $33 million due to the June 2006 Chief acquisition and the
    payouts of our carried interests in Azerbaijan in the last half
    of 2006. The increases in our LOE were partially offset by a
    decrease of $82 million related to properties that were
    sold in 2005.

The factors described above were also the primary factors
    causing LOE per Boe to increase during 2006. Although we
    divested properties in 2005 that had higher

per-unit

operating costs, the cost escalation largely



related to higher commodity prices and the weaker
    U.S. dollar had a greater effect on our per unit costs than
    the property divestitures.

Production
    Taxes

The following table details the changes in production taxes
    between 2005 and 2007. The majority of our production taxes are
    assessed on our onshore domestic properties. In the U.S., most
    of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of
    revenues. Therefore, the changes due to revenues in the table
    primarily relate to changes in oil, gas and NGL revenues from
    our U.S. onshore properties.

2007 production taxes

$


2007 vs. 2006

Production taxes decreased $66 million
    due to a decrease in the effective production tax rate in 2007.
    Our lower production tax rates in 2007 were primarily due to an
    increase in tax credits received on certain horizontal wells in
    the state of Texas and the increase in Azerbaijan revenues
    subsequent to the payouts of our carried interests in the last
    half of 2006. Our Azerbaijan revenues are not subject to
    production taxes. Therefore, the increased revenues generated in
    Azerbaijan in 2007 caused our overall rate of production taxes
    to decrease.

2006 vs. 2005

Production taxes increased $31 million
    due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2006.
    A new Chinese “Special Petroleum Gain” tax was the
    primary contributor to the higher rate.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties
    (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying
    the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during
    the year, by the “depletable base.” The depletable
    base represents our net capitalized investment plus future
    development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves.
    Generally, if reserve volumes are revised up or down, then the
    DD&A rate per unit of production will change inversely.
    However, if the depletable base changes, then the DD&A rate
    moves in the same direction. The per unit DD&A rate is not
    affected by production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A, as
    opposed to the rate per unit of production, generally moves in
    the same direction as production volumes. Oil and gas property
    DD&A is calculated separately on a

country-by-country

basis.

The changes in our production volumes, DD&A rate per unit
    and DD&A of oil and gas properties between 2005 and 2007
    are shown in the table below.

2007 vs. 2006

The 12% production increase caused oil and
    gas property related DD&A to increase $242 million. In
    addition, oil and gas property related DD&A increased
    $355 million due to a 15% increase in the DD&A rate.
    The largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary
    pressure on both the costs incurred during 2007 as well as the
    estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on
    proved undeveloped reserves. Other factors contributing to the
    rate increase include the transfer of previously unproved costs
    to the depletable base as a result of 2007 drilling activities
    and a higher Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2007.
    The effect of these increases was partially offset by a decrease
    resulting from higher reserve estimates due to the effects of
    higher 2007 year-end commodity prices.

2006 vs. 2005

The 3% production decrease caused oil and
    gas property related DD&A to decrease $51 million.
    However, oil and gas property related DD&A increased
    $342 million due to a 20% increase in the DD&A rate.
    The largest contributor to the rate increase was inflationary
    pressure on both the costs incurred during 2006 as well as the
    estimated development costs to be spent in future periods on
    proved undeveloped reserves. Other factors contributing to the
    rate increase included the June 2006 Chief acquisition and the
    transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base as
    a result of 2006 drilling activities. A reduction in reserve
    estimates due to the effects of lower 2006 year-end
    commodity prices also contributed to the rate increase.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our net G&A consists of three primary components. The
    largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses
    incurred for personnel costs, office expenses, professional fees
    and other G&A items. The gross amount of these expenses is
    partially reduced by two offsetting components. One is the
    amount of G&A capitalized pursuant to the full cost method
    of accounting related to exploration and development activities.
    The other is the amount of G&A reimbursed by working
    interest owners of properties for which we serve as the
    operator. These reimbursements are received during both the
    drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. The
    gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts capitalized
    and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Net G&A includes
    expenses related to oil, gas and NGL exploration and production
    activities, as well as marketing and midstream activities. See
    the following table for a summary of G&A expenses by
    component.

2007 vs. 2006

Gross G&A increased $198 million.
    The largest contributors to this increase were higher employee
    compensation and benefits costs. These cost increases, which
    were related to our continued growth and industry inflation,
    caused gross G&A to increase $134 million. Of
    this increase, $55 million related to higher stock
    compensation. In addition, changes in the
    Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate caused a
    $13 million increase in costs.

2006 vs. 2005

Gross G&A increased $189 million.
    Higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused
    gross G&A to increase $148 million. Of this
    increase, $34 million represented stock option expense
    recognized pursuant to our adoption in 2006 of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

. An additional $28 million of the increase
    related to higher restricted stock compensation. In addition,
    changes in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate caused
    an $11 million increase in costs.

The factors discussed above were also the primary factors that
    caused the $69 million and $85 million increases in
    capitalized G&A in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Interest based on debt outstanding increased $22 million
    from 2006 to 2007. This increase was largely due to higher
    average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit
    facility borrowings in 2007 than in 2006, partially offset by
    the effects of repaying various maturing notes in 2007 and 2006.
    Interest based on debt outstanding decreased $21 million
    from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the repayment of various
    maturing notes in 2005 and 2006, partially offset by an increase
    in commercial paper borrowings during 2006 to fund the June 2006
    Chief acquisition.

Capitalized interest increased from 2005 to 2007 primarily due
    to higher cumulative costs related to the development of the
    second phase of our Jackfish heavy oil development project in
    Canada and the construction of the related Access Pipeline.
    Higher development costs in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil also
    contributed to the increase.

During 2005, we redeemed our $400 million 6.75% notes
    due March 15, 2011 and our zero coupon convertible senior
    debentures prior to their scheduled maturity dates. The other
    interest category in the table above includes $81 million
    in 2005 related to these early retirements.

The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

, we began recognizing unrealized gains and
    losses on our investment in Chevron common stock in net earnings
    rather than as part of other comprehensive income. The change in
    fair value of our investment in Chevron common stock resulted
    from an increase in the price of Chevron’s common stock
    during 2007.

In 2005, we recognized a $39 million loss on certain oil
    derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified for
    hedge accounting because the hedged production exceeded actual
    and projected production under these contracts. The lower than
    expected production was caused primarily by hurricanes that
    affected offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2006 and 2005, we reduced the carrying value of certain
    of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities. A detailed
    description of how full cost ceiling limitations are determined
    is included in the “Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates” section of this report. A summary of these
    reductions and additional discussion is provided below.

    Reductions

During the second quarter of 2006, we drilled two unsuccessful
    exploratory wells in Brazil and determined that the capitalized
    costs related to these two wells should be impaired. Therefore,
    in the second quarter of 2006, we recognized a $16 million
    impairment of our investment in Brazil equal to the costs to
    drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of
    block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related to this
    impairment. The two wells were unrelated to our Polvo
    development project in Brazil.

As a result of a decline in projected future net cash flows, the
    carrying value of our Russian properties exceeded the full cost
    ceiling by $10 million at the end of the third quarter of
    2006. Therefore, we recognized a $20 million reduction of
    the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in Russia,
    offset by a $10 million deferred income tax benefit.



    Reduction

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we were capitalizing the
    costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in Brazil pending the
    determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in
    Brazil. At the end of 2005, it was expected that a small initial
    portion of the proved reserves ultimately expected at Polvo
    would be recorded in 2006. Based on preliminary estimates
    developed in the fourth quarter of 2005, the value of this
    initial partial booking of proved reserves was not sufficient to
    offset the sum of the related proportionate Polvo costs plus the
    costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts. Therefore,
    we determined that the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to the
    Polvo project should be impaired. These costs totaled
    approximately $42 million. There was no tax benefit related
    to this Brazilian impairment.

Interest and dividend income decreased from 2006 to 2007
    primarily due to a decrease in income-earning cash and
    investment balances, partially offset by an increase in the
    dividend rate on our investment in Chevron common stock.
    Interest and dividend income increased from 2005 to 2006
    primarily due to an increase in cash and short-term investment
    balances and higher interest rates.

During 2005, we sold certain non-core midstream assets for a net
    gain of $150 million. Also during 2005, we incurred a
    $55 million loss on certain commodity hedges that no longer
    qualified for hedge accounting and were settled prior to the end
    of their original term. These hedges related to U.S. and
    Canadian oil production from properties sold as part of our 2005
    property divestiture program. This loss was partially offset by
    a $7 million gain related to interest rate swaps that were
    settled prior to the end of their original term in conjunction
    with the early redemption of the $400 million
    6.75% senior notes in 2005.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, deferred income taxes were reduced
    $261 million, $243 million and $14 million,
    respectively, due to successive Canadian statutory rate
    reductions that were enacted in each such year.

In 2006, deferred income taxes increased $39 million due to
    the effect of a new income-based tax enacted by the state of
    Texas that replaced a previous franchise tax. The new tax was
    effective January 1, 2007.

In 2005, we recognized $28 million of taxes related to our
    repatriation of $545 million to the United States. The
    cash was repatriated to take advantage of U.S. tax
    legislation that allowed qualifying companies to repatriate cash
    from foreign operations at a reduced income tax rate.
    Substantially all of the cash repatriated by us in 2005 related
    to prior earnings of our Canadian subsidiary.

Earnings
    From Discontinued Operations

In November 2006 and January 2007, we announced our plans to
    divest our operations in Egypt and West Africa, including
    Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon and other countries
    in the region. Pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued
    operations, we have classified all 2007 and prior period amounts
    related to our operations in Egypt and West Africa as
    discontinued operations.

In October 2007, we completed the sale of our Egyptian
    operations and received proceeds of $341 million. As a
    result of this sale, we recognized a $90 million after-tax
    gain in the fourth quarter of 2007. In November 2007, we
    announced an agreement to sell our operations in Gabon for
    $205.5 million. We are finalizing purchase and sales
    agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government
    approvals for the remaining properties in the West African
    divestiture package. We are optimistic we can complete these
    sales during the first half of 2008.

Following are the components of earnings from discontinued
    operations between 2005 and 2007.

2007 vs. 2006

Earnings from discontinued operations
    increased $248 million in 2007. In addition to variances
    caused by changes in production volumes and realized prices, our
    earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 were impacted by
    other significant factors. Pursuant to accounting rules for
    discontinued operations, we ceased recording DD&A in
    November 2006 related to our Egyptian operations and in January
    2007 related to our West African operations. This reduction in
    DD&A caused earnings from discontinued operations to
    increase $119 million in 2007. Earnings in 2007 also
    benefited from the $90 million gain from the sale of our
    Egyptian operations.

In addition, earnings from discontinued operations increased
    $90 million in 2007 due to the net effect of reductions in
    carrying value in 2006 and 2007. Our earnings in 2007 were
    reduced by $13 million from these reductions, compared to
    $103 million of reductions recorded in 2006. Due to
    unsuccessful drilling activities in Nigeria, in the first
    quarter of 2006, we recognized an $85 million impairment of
    our investment in Nigeria equal to the costs to drill two dry
    holes and a proportionate share of block-related costs. There
    was no income tax benefit related to this impairment. As a
    result of unsuccessful exploratory activities in Egypt during
    2006, the net book value of our Egyptian oil and gas properties,
    less related deferred income taxes, exceeded the ceiling by
    $18 million as of the end of September 30, 2006.
    Therefore, in 2006 we recognized an $18 million after-tax
    loss ($31 million pre-tax). In the second quarter of 2007,
    based on drilling activities in Nigeria, we recognized a
    $13 million after-tax loss ($64 million pre-tax).

2006 vs. 2005

Earnings from discontinued operations
    increased $179 million in 2006. This increase was largely
    due to an increase in realized crude oil prices, partially
    offset by a 19% decline in oil production.



In addition, earnings from discontinued operations increased
    $16 million due to the net effect of a $119 million
    after-tax impairment of our investment in Angola in 2005,
    partially offset by the 2006 Nigerian and Egyptian impairments
    totaling $103 million as described above. Our interests in
    Angola were acquired through the 2003 Ocean Energy merger, and
    our Angolan drilling program discovered no proven reserves.
    After drilling three unsuccessful wells in the fourth quarter of
    2005, we determined that all of the Angolan capitalized costs
    should be impaired. As a result, we recognized a
    $170 million impairment with a $51 million related tax
    benefit.

Operating
    Cash Flow — Continuing Operations

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flow”) continued to be our primary source of capital and
    liquidity in 2007. Changes in operating cash flow are largely
    due to the same factors that affect



our net earnings, with the exception of those earnings changes
    due to such noncash expenses as DD&A, financial instrument
    fair value changes, property impairments and deferred income tax
    expense. As a result, our operating cash flow increased in 2007
    primarily due to the increase in earnings as discussed in the
    “Results of Operations” section of this report.

During 2007 and 2006, operating cash flow was primarily used to
    fund our capital expenditures. Excluding the $2.0 billion
    Chief acquisition in June 2006, our operating cash flow was
    sufficient to fund our 2007 and 2006 capital expenditures.
    During 2005, operating cash flow was sufficient to fund our 2005
    capital expenditures and $1.3 billion of debt repayments.

Other
    Sources of Cash

As needed, we utilize cash on hand and access our available
    credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program
    as sources of cash to supplement our operating cash flow.
    Additionally, we invest in highly liquid, short-term investments
    to maximize our income on available cash balances. As needed, we
    may reduce such short-term investment balances to further
    supplement our operating cash flow.

During 2007, we borrowed $1.5 billion under our unsecured
    revolving line of credit and reduced our short-term investment
    balances by $202 million. We also received
    $341 million of proceeds from the sale of our Egyptian
    operations. These sources of cash were used primarily to fund
    net commercial paper repayments, long-term debt repayments,
    common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred
    stock.

During 2006, we borrowed $1.8 billion under our commercial
    paper program and reduced our short-term investment balances by
    $106 million. These sources of cash were largely used to
    fund the $2.0 billion acquisition of Chief in June 2006.
    Also during 2006, we supplemented operating cash flow with cash
    on hand, which was used to fund scheduled long-term debt
    maturities, common stock repurchases and dividends on common and
    preferred stock.

During 2005, we generated $2.2 billion in pre-tax proceeds
    from sales of property and equipment. These consisted of
    $2.0 billion related to the sale of non-core oil and gas
    properties and $164 million related to the sale of non-core
    midstream assets. Net of related income taxes, these proceeds
    were $2.0 billion. During 2005, we also reduced short-term
    investment balances by $287 million. These sources of cash
    were used primarily to repurchase $2.3 billion of common
    stock.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil
    and gas exploration and development operations, our midstream
    operations and other corporate activities. The vast majority of
    our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling or
    development of oil and gas properties, which totaled
    $5.7 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.6 billion in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2006 capital expenditures
    included $2.0 billion related to the acquisition of the
    Chief properties. Excluding the effect of the Chief acquisition,
    the increase in such capital expenditures from 2005 to 2007 was
    due to inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for
    field services and increased drilling activities in the Barnett
    Shale, Gulf of Mexico, Carthage and Groesbeck areas of the
    United States. Additionally, capital expenditures also increased
    on our properties in Azerbaijan where we achieved payout of
    certain carried interests in the last half of 2006.

Our capital expenditures for our midstream operations are
    primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas
    processing plants, natural gas pipeline systems and oil
    pipelines. These midstream facilities exist primarily to support
    our oil and gas development operations. Such expenditures were
    $371 million, $357 million and $121 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The majority of our midstream
    expenditures from 2005 to 2007 have related to development
    activities in the Barnett Shale, the Woodford Shale in eastern
    Oklahoma and Jackfish in Canada.

Debt
    Repayments

During 2007, we repaid the $400 million 4.375% notes,
    which matured on October 1, 2007. Also during 2007, certain
    holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to
    exchange their debentures for shares



of Chevron common stock prior to the debentures’
    August 15, 2008 maturity date. We have the option, in lieu
    of delivering shares of Chevron common stock, to pay exchanging
    debenture holders an amount of cash equal to the market value of
    Chevron common stock. We paid $167 million in cash to
    debenture holders who exercised their exchange rights. This
    amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value
    of $105 million and a $62 million reduction of the
    related embedded derivative option’s balance.

During 2006, we retired the $500 million 2.75% notes
    and the $178 million ($200 million Canadian) 6.55%. We
    also repaid $180 million of debt acquired in the Chief
    acquisition.

During 2005, we spent $0.8 billion to retire zero coupon
    convertible debentures due in 2020 and $400 million
    6.75% notes due in 2011 before their scheduled maturity
    dates. We also spent $0.4 billion to repay various notes
    that matured in 2005.

Repurchases
    of Common Stock

During the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, we
    repurchased 55.2 million shares at a total cost of
    $2.8 billion, or $51.49 per share, under various repurchase
    programs. During 2007, we repurchased 4.1 million shares at
    a cost of $326 million, or $79.80 per share. During 2006,
    we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a cost of
    $253 million, or $59.61 per share. During 2005, we
    repurchased 46.9 million shares at a cost of
    $2.3 billion, or $48.28 per share.

Dividends

Our common stock dividends were $249 million,
    $199 million and $136 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. We also paid $10 million of preferred stock
    dividends in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The increases in common stock
    dividends from 2005 to 2007 were primarily related to 25% and
    50% increases in the quarterly dividend rate in the first
    quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase from 2005
    to 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in outstanding shares
    due to share repurchases.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has
    been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain revolving
    lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be
    accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other
    available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance
    of equity securities and long-term debt. During 2008, another
    major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our
    operations in West Africa. We expect the combination of these
    sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund future
    capital expenditures, debt repayments, common stock repurchases,
    and other contractual commitments as discussed later in this
    section.

Operating
    Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow has increased approximately 16% since
    2005, reaching a total of $6.2 billion in 2007. We expect
    operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of
    liquidity. Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many
    variables, the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil,
    natural gas and NGLs we produce. Prices for these commodities
    are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions.
    Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other
    substantially variable factors influence market conditions for
    these products. These factors are beyond our control and are
    difficult to predict.

We periodically deem it appropriate to mitigate some of the risk
    inherent in oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, we have
    utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a
    portion of our production. We have also utilized various price
    swap contracts and fixed-price physical delivery contracts to
    fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and
    natural gas production. Based on contracts in place as of
    February 15, 2008, in 2008 approximately 64% of our
    estimated natural gas production and 12% of our estimated oil
    production are subject to either price collars, swaps or
    fixed-price contracts. The key terms of these contracts are
    summarized in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk.”



Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through
    an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity
    price increases, as experienced in recent years, can lead to an
    increase in drilling and development activities. As a result,
    the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and
    materials may also increase, causing a negative impact on our
    cash flow.

Credit
    Availability

We have two revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper
    program, which we can access to provide liquidity. At
    December 31, 2007, our total available borrowing capacity
    was $1.3 billion.

Our $2.5 billion five-year, syndicated, unsecured revolving
    line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”) matures
    on April 7, 2012, and all amounts outstanding will be due
    and payable at that time unless the maturity is extended. Prior
    to each April 7 anniversary date, we have the option to extend
    the maturity of the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject
    to the approval of the lenders.

The Senior Credit Facility includes a five-year revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million. Amounts borrowed under the Senior
    Credit Facility may, at our election, bear interest at various
    fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months. Such
    rates are generally less than the prime rate. However, we may
    elect to borrow at the prime rate. As of December 31, 2007,
    there were $1.4 billion of borrowings under the Senior
    Credit Facility at an average rate of 5.27%.

On August 7, 2007, we established a new $1.5 billion

364-day,

syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the
    “Short-Term Facility”). This facility provides us with
    provisional interim liquidity until we receive the proceeds from
    divestitures of assets in West Africa. The Short-Term Facility
    was also used to support an increase in our commercial paper
    program from $2 billion to $3.5 billion.

The Short-Term Facility matures on August 5, 2008. At that
    time, all amounts outstanding will be due and payable unless the
    maturity is extended. Prior to August 5, 2008, we have the
    option to convert any outstanding principal amount of loans
    under the Short-Term Facility to a term loan, which will be
    repayable in a single payment on August 4, 2009.

Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Facility bear interest at
    various fixed rate options for periods of up to 12 months.
    Such rates are generally less than the prime rate. We may also
    elect to borrow at the prime rate. As of December 31, 2007,
    there were no borrowings under the Short-Term Facility.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $3.5 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility or the Short-Term Facility on a
    dollar-for-dollar basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a
    maturity of between one and 90 days, although it can have a
    maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates
    agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is
    based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR,
    or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper
    market. As of December 31, 2007, we had $1.0 billion
    of commercial paper debt outstanding at an average rate of 5.07%.

The Senior Credit Facility and Short-Term Facility contain only
    one material financial covenant. This covenant requires our
    ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less
    than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions of total
    funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to
    the respective amounts reported in our consolidated financial
    statements. As defined in the agreement, total funded debt
    excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of
    Chevron Corporation common stock. Also, total capitalization is
    adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full
    cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of
    December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with this
    covenant. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31,
    2007, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was
    23.8%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility and
    Short-Term Facility is not restricted under any “material
    adverse effect” clauses. It is not uncommon for credit
    agreements to include such clauses. These clauses can remove the
    obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition
    or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and
    adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition,
    operations,



properties or business considered as a whole, the
    borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments, or the
    enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. While
    our credit facilities include covenants that require us to
    report a condition or event having a material adverse effect,
    the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not
    conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.

Debt
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the
    United States. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies
    consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
    levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
    commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
    agencies. Our current debt ratings are BBB with a positive
    outlook by Standard & Poor’s, Baa1 with a stable
    outlook by Moody’s and BBB with a positive outlook by Fitch.

There are no “rating triggers” in any of our
    contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled
    maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level.
    Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility and
    Short-Term Facility is predicated on our corporate debt rating.
    Therefore, even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate
    scheduled maturities, it would adversely impact the interest
    rate on any borrowings under our credit facilities. Under the
    terms of the Senior Credit Facility and the Short-Term Facility,
    a one-notch downgrade would increase the fully-drawn borrowing
    costs for the credit facilities from LIBOR plus 35 basis
    points to a new rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. A
    ratings downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to
    economically access debt markets in the future. As of
    December 31, 2007, we were not aware of any potential
    ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.

Capital
    Expenditures

In February 2008, we provided guidance for our 2008 capital
    expenditures, which are expected to range from $6.6 billion
    to $7.0 billion. This represents the largest planned use of
    our 2008 operating cash flow, with the high end of the range
    being 13% higher than our 2007 capital expenditures. To a
    certain degree, the ultimate timing of these capital
    expenditures is within our control. Therefore, if oil and
    natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates, we could
    choose to defer a portion of these planned 2008 capital
    expenditures until later periods, or accelerate capital
    expenditures planned for periods beyond 2008 to achieve the
    desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. Based
    upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2008 and
    the commodity price collars, swaps and fixed-price contracts we
    have in place, we anticipate having adequate capital resources
    to fund our 2008 capital expenditures.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Programs

We have an ongoing, annual stock repurchase program to minimize
    dilution resulting from restricted stock issued to, and options
    exercised by, employees. In 2008, the repurchase program
    authorizes the repurchase of up to 4.8 million shares or a
    cost of $422 million, whichever amount is reached first.

In anticipation of the completion of our West African
    divestitures, our Board of Directors has approved a separate
    program to repurchase up to 50 million shares. This program
    expires on December 31, 2009.

Exchangeable
    Debentures

As of December 31, 2007, our outstanding debt included
    debentures that are exchangeable for Chevron common stock. These
    debentures have a scheduled maturity date of August 15,
    2008. Although these debentures are now due within one year, we
    continue to classify this debt as long-term because we have the
    intent and ability to refinance these debentures on a long-term
    basis with the available capacity under our existing credit
    facilities or other long-term financing arrangements.



Canadian
    Royalties

On October 25, 2007, the Alberta government proposed
    increases to the royalty rates on oil and natural gas production
    beginning in 2009. We believe this proposal would reduce future
    earnings and cash flows from our oil and gas properties located
    in Alberta. Additionally, assuming all other factors are equal,
    higher royalty rates would likely result in lower levels of
    capital investment in Alberta relative to our other areas of
    operation. However, the magnitude of the potential impact, which
    will depend on the final form of enacted legislation and other
    factors that impact the relative expected economic returns of
    capital projects, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Pension
    Funding and Estimates

Funded Status.

As compared to the
    “projected benefit obligation,” our qualified and
    nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by
    $230 million and $178 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. A detailed reconciliation of the
    2007 changes to our underfunded status is included in
    Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements. Of the $230 million underfunded status at the
    end of 2007, $198 million is attributable to various
    nonqualified defined benefit plans that have no plan assets.
    However, we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit
    obligations of such nonqualified plans. As of December 31,
    2007, these trusts had investments with a fair value of
    $59 million. The value of these trusts is included in
    noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

As compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation,”
    our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by
    $62 million at December 31, 2007. The accumulated
    benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation
    in that the former includes no assumption about future
    compensation levels. Our current intentions are to provide
    sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated
    benefit obligation remains fully funded. The actual amount of
    contributions required during this period will depend on
    investment returns from the plan assets and payments made to
    participants. Required contributions also depend upon changes in
    actuarial assumptions made during the same period, particularly
    the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the
    accumulated benefit obligation. For 2008, we anticipate the
    accumulated benefit obligation will remain fully funded without
    contributing to our qualified defined benefit plans. Therefore,
    we don’t expect to contribute to the plans during 2008.

Pension Estimate Assumptions.

Our pension
    expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’
    approximate service periods and is generally calculated
    independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized
    expense for our defined benefit pension plans of
    $41 million, $31 million and $26 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. We estimate that our pension
    expense will approximate $61 million in 2008.



The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
    requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
    assumptions can result in different expense and liability
    amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the
    assumptions. We believe that the two most critical assumptions
    affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount
    rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
    weighted average rate of return of 8.40% at both
    December 31, 2007 and 2006. We developed these expected
    long-term rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from
    external consultants and economists as well as long-term
    inflation assumptions. The expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types
    in such assets. The target investment allocation for our plan
    assets is 50% U.S. large cap equity securities; 15%
    U.S. small cap equity securities, equally allocated between
    growth and value; 15% international equity securities, equally
    allocated between growth and value; and 20% debt securities. We
    expect our long-term asset allocation on average to approximate
    the targeted allocation. We regularly review our actual asset
    allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the
    targeted allocation when considered appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
    assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
    assumption of 100 basis points (from 8.40% to 7.40%) would
    increase the expected 2008 pension expense by $6 million.

We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted
    average rate of 6.22% and 5.72% at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The discount rate is determined at the end
    of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be
    effectively settled, considering the expected timing of future
    cash flows related to the plans. This rate is based on
    high-quality bond yields, after allowing for call and default
    risk. We consider high quality corporate bond yield indices,
    such as Moody’s Aa, when selecting the discount rate.

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
    as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
    25 basis points (from 6.22% to 5.97%) would increase our
    pension liability at December 31, 2007, by
    $28 million, and increase estimated 2008 pension expense by
    $4 million.

At December 31, 2007, we had actuarial losses of
    $208 million, which will be recognized as a component of
    pension expense in future years. These losses are primarily due
    to reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in
    participant wages. We estimate that approximately
    $14 million and $12 million of the unrecognized
    actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2008 and
    2009, respectively. The $14 million estimated to be
    recognized in 2008 is a component of the total estimated 2008
    pension expense of $61 million referred to earlier in this
    section.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
    various other factors related to the participants in our defined
    benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and
    liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors
    will be in the future.

On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act was signed
    into law. Beginning in 2008, this act will cause extensive
    changes in the determination of both the minimum required
    contribution and the maximum tax deductible limit. Because the
    new required contribution will approximate our current policy of
    fully funding the accumulated benefit obligation, the changes
    are not expected to have a significant impact on future cash
    flows.

Contingencies
    and Legal Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters,
    see Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial



statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from
    these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded
    when known.

The critical accounting policies used by management in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those
    that are important both to the presentation of our financial
    condition and results of operations and require significant
    judgments by management with regard to estimates used. Our
    critical accounting policies and significant judgments and
    estimates related to those policies are described below. We have
    reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors.

Full
    Cost Ceiling Calculations

Policy
    Description

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
    calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
    amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
    sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
    after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
    properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
    value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
    subject to amortization. If our net book value of oil and gas
    properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of
    the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an
    expense, except as discussed in the following paragraph. The
    ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in
    which we have oil and gas properties.

If, subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the
    applicable financial statements being published, prices increase
    to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be
    recovered, a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the
    quarter is not required to be recorded. A writedown indicated at
    the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of
    additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the
    quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements
    would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered,
    as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter.
    An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a
    subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have
    increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The discounted present value of future net revenues for our
    proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is a major component of
    the ceiling calculation, and represents the component that
    requires the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves
    are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates
    of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process
    of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves requires
    substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations,
    particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers
    may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the
    same data. Certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or
    audited by outside petroleum consultants, while other reserve
    estimates are prepared by our engineers. See Note 15 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
    regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior
    estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
    years, annual revisions to our reserve estimates, which have
    been both increases and decreases in individual years, have
    averaged approximately 1% of the previous year’s estimate.
    However, there can be no assurance that more significant
    revisions will not be necessary in the future. If future
    significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously
    estimated reserve quantities, it could result in a full cost
    property writedown. In addition to the impact of the estimates
    of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling, estimates
    of proved reserves are also a significant component of the
    calculation of DD&A.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
    judgment, the associated prices of oil, natural gas and NGL
    reserves, and the applicable discount rate, that are used to
    calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not
    require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10%
    discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as
    of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely.
    Therefore, the



future net revenues associated with the estimated proved
    reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or
    costs. Rather, they are based on such prices and costs in effect
    as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is
    performed. In calculating the ceiling, we adjust the
    end-of-period price by the effect of derivative contracts in
    place that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. This
    adjustment requires little judgment as the end-of-period price
    is adjusted using the contract prices for such hedges. None of
    our outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2007
    qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect
    as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
    indefinitely, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting
    value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.
    Oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. On
    any particular day at the end of a quarter, prices can be either
    substantially higher or lower than our long-term price forecast
    that is a barometer for true fair value. Therefore, oil and gas
    property writedowns that result from applying the full cost
    ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price
    as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
    reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a
    reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Policy
    Description

The majority of our historical derivative instruments have
    consisted of commodity financial instruments used to manage our
    cash flow exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We have also
    entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to
    interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps mitigate
    either the cash flow effects of interest rate fluctuations on
    interest expense for variable-rate debt instruments, or the fair
    value effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed-rate debt.
    We also have an embedded option derivative related to the fair
    value of our debentures exchangeable into shares of Chevron
    Corporation common stock.

All derivatives are recognized at their current fair value on
    our balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
    such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If hedge accounting criteria are
    met for fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is
    recorded in the statement of operations with an offsetting
    amount recorded for the change in fair value of the hedged item.

A derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the
    derivative contract is entered into or the date of an
    acquisition or business combination that includes derivative
    contracts. Additionally, we must document the relationship
    between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as the
    risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    instrument. We must also assess, both at the instrument’s
    inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative is
    highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the
    hedged item.

For the derivative financial instruments we have executed in
    2006, 2007 and to date in 2008, we have chosen to not meet the
    necessary criteria to qualify such instruments for hedge
    accounting.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative
    instruments require substantial judgment. For these instruments,
    we obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil
    and gas trading points in North America from independent third
    parties. These forward prices are compared to the price
    parameters contained in the hedge agreements. The resulting
    estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the
    hedge contracts are discounted using LIBOR and money market
    futures rates for the first year and money market futures and
    swap rates thereafter. In addition, we estimate the option value
    of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model.
    These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the
    period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes
    in forward prices, regional price differentials and interest



rates. Fair values of our other derivative instruments require
    less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from
    independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers.

Quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal
    impact on our liquidity, capital resources or results of
    operations, as long as the derivative instruments qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair values of
    derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
    can have a significant impact on our results of operations, but
    generally will not impact our liquidity or capital resources.
    Settlements of derivative instruments, regardless of whether
    they qualify for hedge accounting, do have an impact on our
    liquidity and results of operations. Generally, if actual market
    prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments,
    our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower
    relative to the results that would have occurred absent these
    instruments. The opposite is also true. Additional information
    regarding the effects that changes in market prices will have on
    our derivative financial instruments, net earnings and cash flow
    from operations is included in “Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

Business
    Combinations

Policy
    Description

From our beginning as a public company in 1988 through 2003, we
    grew substantially through acquisitions of other oil and natural
    gas companies. Most of these acquisitions have been accounted
    for using the purchase method of accounting, and recent
    accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions
    will be accounted for using the purchase method.

Under the purchase method, the acquiring company adds to its
    balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired
    company’s assets and liabilities. Any excess of the
    purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and
    intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is assessed for impairment at least annually.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

There are various assumptions we make in determining the fair
    values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities. The
    most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most
    judgment, involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas
    properties acquired. To determine the fair values of these
    properties, we prepare estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL
    reserves. These estimates are based on work performed by our
    engineers and that of outside consultants. The judgments
    associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier
    in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling
    calculation.

However, there are factors involved in estimating the fair
    values of acquired oil, natural gas and NGL properties that
    require more judgment than that involved in the full cost
    ceiling calculation. As stated above, the full cost ceiling
    calculation applies end-of-period price and cost information to
    the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount. By contrast, the
    fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must
    be based on our estimates of future oil, natural gas and NGL
    prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our own
    analysis of pricing trends. These estimates are based on current
    data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and
    demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts. They are also
    based on industry data regarding natural gas storage
    availability, drilling rig activity, changes in delivery
    capacity, trends in regional pricing differentials and other
    fundamental analysis. Forecasts of future prices from
    independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing
    estimates.

We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve
    quantities acquired, and estimate future operating and
    development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net
    revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues
    are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the
    time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital.

We also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair
    value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination.
    These unproved properties generally represent the value of
    probable and possible reserves. Because of their very nature,
    probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than
    those of proved reserves. To compensate for the inherent risk of
    estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the



discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves
    are reduced by what we consider to be an appropriate
    risk-weighting factor in each particular instance. It is common
    for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible
    reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from 30% to 80% to
    arrive at what we consider to be the appropriate fair values.

Generally, in our business combinations, the determination of
    the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more
    judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities.
    The acquired companies commonly have long-term debt that we
    assume in the acquisition, and this debt must be recorded at the
    estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt. However,
    significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in
    these situations due to the existence of comparable market
    values of debt issued by peer companies.

Except for the 2002 acquisition of Mitchell Energy &
    Development Corp., our mergers and acquisitions have involved
    other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area
    of exploration, development and production activities related to
    oil and gas properties. However, in addition to exploration,
    development and production activities, Mitchell’s business
    also included substantial marketing and midstream activities.
    Therefore, a portion of the Mitchell purchase price was
    allocated to the fair value of Mitchell’s marketing and
    midstream facilities and equipment. This consisted primarily of
    natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems.

The Mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing
    properties that we also acquired from Mitchell. Therefore,
    certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the
    gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the
    midstream assets. For example, future quantities of natural gas
    estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were
    based on the same estimates used to value the proved and
    unproved gas producing properties. Future expected prices for
    marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price
    cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas
    producing assets acquired from Mitchell. Based on historical
    costs and known trends and commitments, we also estimated future
    operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream
    assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows. These cash
    flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to
    discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets
    to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and
    midstream facilities and equipment.

In addition to the valuation methods described above, we perform
    other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in
    any business combination. These analyses include information
    related to comparable companies, comparable transactions and
    premiums paid.

In a comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
    market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
    independent exploration and production companies with comparable
    financial and operating characteristics. Such characteristics
    are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
    characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to
    those of the party to the proposed business combination. We
    compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed
    business combination company multiples for reasonableness.

In a comparable transactions analysis, we review certain
    acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and
    production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages
    announced recently. We compare these comparable transaction
    multiples to the proposed business combination transaction
    multiples for reasonableness.

In a premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected
    independent exploration and production company transactions in
    addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded
    companies announced recently, to review the premiums paid to the
    price of the target one day, one week and one month prior to the
    announcement of the transaction. We use this information to
    determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to
    the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness.

While these estimates of fair value for the various assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity
    or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future
    results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value
    assigned to both the oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas
    properties, the lower



future net earnings will be as a result of higher future
    depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Also, a higher
    fair value assigned to the oil and gas properties, based on
    higher future estimates of oil and gas prices, will increase the
    likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that
    subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that
    was used to originally determine fair value. A full cost ceiling
    writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital
    resources in that period because it is a noncash charge, but it
    would adversely affect results of operations. As discussed in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Capital Resources, Uses and Liquidity,” in calculating our
    debt-to-capitalization ratio under our credit agreement, total
    capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial
    writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or
    goodwill impairments.

Our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many
    estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair
    value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business
    combination. As previously disclosed in our discussion of the
    full cost ceiling calculations, during the past five years, our
    annual revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged
    approximately 1%. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
    there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity
    estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil
    and gas properties acquired in a business combination. The
    inter-relationship of these estimates makes it impractical to
    provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of
    changes in these estimates.

Valuation
    of Goodwill

Policy
    Description

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. This
    requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and
    liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above
    for a business combination. Therefore, considerable judgment
    similar to that described above in connection with estimating
    the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination
    is also required to assess goodwill for impairment.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil
    and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower
    goodwill would be. A lower goodwill value decreases the
    likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes
    in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the
    likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill
    impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital
    resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of
    operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
    in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
    provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
    changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
    average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

, which
    replaces Statement No. 141. Statement No. 141(R)
    retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141
    that an acquirer be identified and the acquisition method of
    accounting (previously called the purchase method) be used for
    all business combinations. Statement No. 141(R)’s
    scope is broader than that of Statement No. 141, which
    applied only to business combinations in which control was
    obtained by transferring consideration. By applying the
    acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    Statement No. 141(R) improves the comparability of the
    information about business combinations provided in financial
    reports. Statement No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, as well as any
    resulting goodwill. Statement No. 141(R) applies
    prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We will
    evaluate how the new requirements of Statement No. 141(R)
    would impact any business combinations completed in 2009 or
    thereafter.



In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

. A
    noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest,
    is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,
    directly or indirectly, to a parent. Statement No. 160
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Under Statement No. 160,
    noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary must be reported as a
    component of consolidated equity separate from the parent’s
    equity. Additionally, the amounts of consolidated net income
    attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest
    must be reported separately on the face of the income statement.
    Statement No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
    prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of Statement
    No. 160 to have a material impact on our financial
    statements and related disclosures.

    Estimates

The forward-looking statements provided in this discussion are
    based on our examination of historical operating trends, the
    information that was used to prepare the December 31, 2007
    reserve reports and other data in our possession or available
    from third parties. These forward-looking statements were
    prepared assuming demand, curtailment, producibility and general
    market conditions for our oil, natural gas and NGLs during 2008
    will be substantially similar to those of 2007, unless otherwise
    noted. We make reference to the “Disclosure Regarding
    Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this
    report. Amounts related to Canadian operations have been
    converted to U.S. dollars using a projected average 2008
    exchange rate of $0.98 U.S. dollar to $1.00 Canadian dollar.

In January 2007, we announced our intent to divest our West
    African oil and gas assets and terminate our operations in West
    Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon
    and other countries in the region. In November 2007, we
    announced an agreement to sell our operations in Gabon for
    $205.5 million. We are finalizing purchase and sales
    agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government
    approvals for the remaining properties in this divestiture
    package. We are optimistic we can complete these sales during
    the first half of 2008.

All West African related revenues, expenses and capital will be
    reported as discontinued operations in our 2008 financial
    statements. Accordingly, all forward-looking estimates in the
    following discussion exclude amounts related to our operations
    in West Africa, unless otherwise noted.

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions and
    dispositions in recent years, these transactions are opportunity
    driven. Thus, the following forward-looking estimates do not
    include any financial and operating effects of potential
    property acquisitions or divestitures that may occur during
    2008, except for West Africa as previously discussed.

Oil,
    Gas and NGL Production

Set forth below are our estimates of oil, gas and NGL production
    for 2008. We estimate that our combined 2008 oil, gas and NGL
    production will total approximately 240 to 247 MMBoe. Of
    this total, approximately 92% is estimated to be produced from
    reserves classified as “proved” at December 31,
    2007. The following estimates for oil, gas and NGL production
    are calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total
    production.

Oil and
    Gas Operating Area Prices

We expect our 2008 average prices for the oil and gas production
    from each of our operating areas to differ from the NYMEX price
    as set forth in the following table. These expected ranges are
    exclusive of the anticipated effects of the oil and gas
    financial contracts presented in the “Commodity Price Risk
    Management” section below.

The NYMEX price for oil is the monthly average of settled prices
    on each trading day for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude
    oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma. The NYMEX price for gas is
    determined to be the first-of-month south Louisiana Henry Hub
    price index as published monthly in

Inside FERC.

Commodity
    Price Risk Management

From time to time, we enter into NYMEX-related financial
    commodity collar and price swap contracts. Such contracts are
    used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due
    to oil and gas price volatility. Although these financial
    contracts do not relate to specific production from our
    operating areas, they will affect our overall revenues and
    average realized oil and gas prices in 2008.

The key terms of our 2008 oil and gas financial collar and price
    swap contracts are presented in the following tables. The tables
    include contracts entered into as of February 15, 2008.

To the extent that monthly NYMEX prices in 2008 differ from
    those established by the gas price swaps, or are outside of the
    ranges established by the oil and natural gas collars, we and
    the counterparties to the contracts will settle the difference.
    Such settlements will either increase or decrease our oil and
    gas revenues for the period. Also, we will mark-to-market the
    contracts based on their fair values throughout 2008. Changes in
    the contracts’ fair values will also be recorded as
    increases or decreases to our oil and gas revenues. The expected
    ranges of our realized oil and gas prices as a percentage of
    NYMEX prices, which are presented earlier in this document, do
    not include any estimates of the impact on our oil and gas
    prices from monthly settlements or changes in the fair values of
    our oil and gas price swaps and collars.

Marketing
    and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived
    primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline
    systems. These revenues and expenses vary in response to several
    factors. The factors include, but are not limited to, changes in
    production from wells connected to the pipelines and related
    processing plants, changes in the absolute and relative prices
    of gas and NGLs, provisions of contractual agreements and the
    amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain
    anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes.

These factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
    future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
    these uncertainties, we estimate that our 2008 marketing and
    midstream operating profit will be between $510 million and
    $550 million. We estimate that marketing and midstream
    revenues will be between $1.61 billion and
    $2.01 billion, and marketing and midstream expenses will be
    between $1.10 billion and $1.46 billion.

Production
    and Operating Expenses

Our production and operating expenses include lease operating
    expenses, transportation costs and production taxes. These
    expenses vary in response to several factors. Among the most
    significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from
    the property base, changes in the general price level of
    services and materials that are used in the operation of the
    properties, the amount of repair and workover activity required
    and changes in production tax rates. Oil, gas and NGL prices
    also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the
    economic feasibility of planned workover projects.

Given these uncertainties, we expect that our 2008 lease
    operating expenses will be between $2.17 billion to
    $2.24 billion. Additionally, we estimate that our
    production taxes for 2008 will be between 3.5% and 4.0% of total
    oil, gas and NGL revenues, excluding the effect on revenues from
    financial collars and price swap contracts upon which production
    taxes are not assessed.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”)

Our 2008 oil and gas property DD&A rate will depend on
    various factors. Most notable among such factors are the amount
    of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or
    acquisition efforts in 2008 compared to the costs incurred for
    such efforts, and the revisions to our year-end 2007 reserve
    estimates that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made
    during 2008.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that our oil and gas
    property-related DD&A rate will be between $12.75 per Boe
    and $13.25 per Boe. Based on these DD&A rates and the
    production estimates set forth earlier, oil and gas property
    related DD&A expense for 2008 is expected to be between
    $3.09 billion and $3.20 billion.

Additionally, we expect that our depreciation and amortization
    expense related to non-oil and gas property fixed assets will
    total between $260 million and $270 million in 2008.

Accretion
    of Asset Retirement Obligation

Accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2008 is expected to
    be between $75 million and $85 million.



General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our G&A includes employee compensation and benefits costs
    and the costs of many different goods and services used in
    support of our business. G&A varies with the level of our
    operating activities and the related staffing and professional
    services requirements. In addition, employee compensation and
    benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect
    the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to
    employees. Also, goods and services are subject to general price
    level increases or decreases. Therefore, significant variances
    in any of these factors from current expectations could cause
    actual G&A to vary materially from the estimate.

Given these limitations, we estimate our G&A for 2008 will
    be between $590 million and $610 million. This
    estimate includes approximately $90 million of non-cash,
    share-based compensation, net of related capitalization in
    accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and
    gas properties.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties described in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates.” Reductions to the carrying value of our oil and
    gas properties are largely dependent on the success of drilling
    results and oil and natural gas prices at the end of our
    quarterly reporting periods. Due to the uncertain nature of
    future drilling efforts and oil and natural gas prices, we are
    not able to predict whether we will incur such reductions in
    2008.

Interest
    Expense

Future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant
    effect on our interest expense. We can only marginally influence
    the prices we will receive in 2008 from sales of oil, gas and
    NGLs and the resulting cash flow. Likewise, we can only
    marginally influence the timing of the closing of our West
    African divestitures and the attendant cash receipts. These
    factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating
    future outstanding debt balances and related interest expense.
    Other factors that affect outstanding debt balances and related
    interest expense, such as the amount and timing of capital
    expenditures are generally within our control.

Based on the information related to interest expense set forth
    below, we expect our 2008 interest expense to be between
    $340 million and $350 million. This estimate assumes
    no material changes in prevailing interest rates. This estimate
    also assumes no material changes in our expected level of
    indebtedness, except for an assumption that our commercial paper
    and credit facility borrowings will decrease in conjunction with
    the planned divestiture of our West African operations, which we
    are optimistic will be completed by the end of the second
    quarter of 2008.

The interest expense in 2008 related to our fixed-rate debt,
    including net accretion of related discounts, will be
    approximately $385 million. This fixed-rate debt removes
    the uncertainty of future interest rates from some, but not all,
    of our long-term debt.

Our floating rate debt is comprised of variable-rate commercial
    paper and borrowings against our senior credit facility. Our
    floating rate debt is summarized in the following table:

The interest rate is based on a standard index such as the
    Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as found on
    the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2007, the
    average rate on the outstanding balance was 5.07%.



(3)

The borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at
    various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months
    and are generally less than the prime rate. As of
    December 31, 2007, the average rate on the outstanding
    balance was 5.27%.

Based on estimates of future LIBOR and prime rates as of
    December 31, 2007, interest expense on floating rate debt,
    including net amortization of premiums, is expected to total
    between $70 million and $80 million in 2008.

Our interest expense totals include payments of facility and
    agency fees, amortization of debt issuance costs and other
    miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances
    outstanding. We expect between $5 million and
    $15 million of such items to be included in our 2008
    interest expense. Also, we expect to capitalize between
    $120 million and $130 million of interest during 2008,
    including amounts related to our discontinued operations.

Other
    Income

We estimate that our other income in 2008 will be between
    $55 million and $75 million.

As of the end of 2007, we had received insurance claim
    settlements related to the 2005 hurricanes that were
    $150 million in excess of amounts incurred to repair
    related damages. None of this $150 million excess has been
    recognized as income, pending the resolution of the amount of
    future necessary repairs and the settlement of certain claims
    that have been filed with secondary insurers. Based on the most
    recent estimates of our costs for repairs, we believe that some
    amount will ultimately be recorded as other income. However, the
    timing and amount that would be recorded as other income are
    uncertain. Therefore, the 2008 estimate for other income above
    does not include any amount related to hurricane proceeds.

Income
    Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2008 will vary materially
    depending on the actual amount of financial pre-tax earnings.
    The tax rate for 2008 will be significantly affected by the
    proportional share of consolidated pre-tax earnings generated by
    U.S., Canadian and International operations due to the different
    tax rates of each country. There are certain tax deductions and
    credits that will have a fixed impact on 2008 income tax expense
    regardless of the level of pre-tax earnings that are produced.

Given the uncertainty of pre-tax earnings, we expect that our
    consolidated financial income tax rate in 2008 will be between
    20% and 40%. The current income tax rate is expected to be
    between 10% and 15%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to
    be between 10% and 25%. Significant changes in estimated capital
    expenditures, production levels of oil, gas and NGLs, the prices
    of such products, marketing and midstream revenues, or any of
    the various expense items could materially alter the effect of
    the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2008 financial
    income tax rates.

Discontinued
    Operations

As previously discussed, in November 2007, we announced an
    agreement to sell our operations in Gabon for
    $205.5 million. We are finalizing purchase and sales
    agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government
    approvals for the remaining properties in the West African
    divestiture package. We are optimistic we can complete these
    sales during the first half of 2008.

The following table presents the 2008 estimates for production,
    production and operating expenses and capital expenditures
    associated with these discontinued operations. These estimates
    include amounts related to



all assets in the West African divestiture package for the first
    half of 2008. Pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued
    operations, the West African assets are not subject to DD&A
    during 2008.

Capital
    Expenditures

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions in
    recent years, these transactions are opportunity driven. Thus,
    we do not “budget,” nor can we reasonably predict, the
    timing or size of such possible acquisitions.

Our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of
    future oil, gas and NGL prices, as well as the expected costs of
    the capital additions. Should actual prices received differ
    materially from our price expectations for our future
    production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred and,
    consequently, may increase or decrease total 2008 capital
    expenditures. In addition, if the actual material or labor costs
    of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated
    amounts, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from
    our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed above, the following table shows
    expected drilling, development and facilities expenditures by
    geographic area. Development capital includes development
    activity related to reserves classified as proved as of year-end
    2007 and drilling activity in areas that do not offset currently
    productive units and for which there is not a certainty of
    continued production from a known productive formation.
    Exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to find and
    produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new
    reservoirs.

In addition to the above expenditures for drilling, development
    and facilities, we expect to spend between $325 million to
    $375 million on our marketing and midstream assets, which
    primarily include our oil pipelines, gas processing plants, and
    gas pipeline systems. We expect to capitalize between
    $335 million and $345 million of G&A expenses in
    accordance with the full cost method of accounting and to
    capitalize between $110 million and $120 million of
    interest. We also expect to pay between $70 million and
    $80 million for plugging and abandonment charges, and to
    spend between $130 million and $140 million for other
    non-oil and gas property fixed assets.

Other
    Cash Uses

Our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common
    stock dividend to continue. With the current $0.14 per share
    quarterly dividend rate and 444 million shares of common
    stock outstanding as of December 31, 2007, dividends are
    expected to approximate $250 million. Also, we have
    $150 million of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock upon which
    we will pay $10 million of dividends in 2008.



Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Our estimated 2008 cash uses, including our drilling and
    development activities, retirement of debt and repurchase of
    common stock, are expected to be funded primarily through a
    combination of existing cash and short-term investments,
    operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of our assets in
    West Africa. Any remaining cash uses could be funded by
    increasing our borrowings under our commercial paper program or
    with borrowings from the available capacity under our credit
    facilities, which was approximately $1.3 billion at
    December 31, 2007. The amount of operating cash flow to be
    generated during 2008 is uncertain due to the factors affecting
    revenues and expenses as previously cited. However, we expect
    our combined capital resources to be more than adequate to fund
    our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses for
    2008. If significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital
    requirements arise during the year, we could utilize our
    existing credit facilities

and/or

seek
    to establish and utilize other sources of financing.

Our $372 million of short-term investments as of
    December 31, 2007 consisted entirely of auction rate
    securities collateralized by student loans which are
    substantially guaranteed by the United States government.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we have reduced our
    auction rate securities holdings to $153 million. However,
    beginning on February 8, 2008, we experienced difficulty
    selling additional securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism which provides liquidity to these securities. The
    securities for which auctions have failed will continue to
    accrue interest and be auctioned every 28 days until the
    auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the
    securities mature. Accordingly, there may be no effective
    mechanism for selling these securities, and the securities we
    own may become long-term investments. At this time, we do not
    believe such securities are impaired or that the failure of the
    auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market
    risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse
    changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. The disclosures are not meant to be
    precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
    instruments were entered into for purposes other than
    speculative trading.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
    our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
    driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
    market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian natural
    gas and NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production
    has been volatile and unpredictable for several years. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

We periodically enter into financial hedging activities with
    respect to a portion of our oil and gas production through
    various financial transactions that hedge the future prices
    received. These transactions include financial price swaps
    whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay
    a variable market price to the contract counterparty, and
    costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for
    the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices
    are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in
    the various collars, we will settle the difference with the
    counterparty to the collars. These financial hedging activities
    are intended to support oil and gas prices at targeted levels
    and to manage our exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. We
    do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative
    trading purposes.

Based on natural gas contracts in place as of February 15,
    2008 we have approximately 1.6 Bcf per day of gas
    production in 2008 that is subject to either price swaps or
    collars or fixed-price contracts. This amount represents
    approximately 64% of our estimated 2008 gas production, or 40%
    of our total Boe production. All of these price swap and collar
    contracts expire December 31, 2008. As of February 15,
    2008, we do not have any gas price swaps or collars extending
    beyond 2008. However, our fixed-price physical delivery
    contracts



extend through 2011. These physical delivery contracts relate to
    our Canadian natural gas production and range from six Bcf to
    14 Bcf per year. These physical delivery contracts are not
    expected to have a material effect on our realized gas prices
    from 2009 through 2011.

The key terms of our 2008 gas financial collar and price swap
    contracts are presented in the following table.

Based on oil contracts in place as of February 15, 2008 we
    have approximately 22,000 Bbls per day of oil production in
    2008 that is subject to price collars. This amount represents
    approximately 12% of our estimated 2008 oil production, or 3% of
    our total Boe production. All of these price collar contracts
    expire December 31, 2008. As of February 15, 2008, we
    do not have any oil price swaps or collars extending beyond 2008.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2007, we had debt outstanding of
    $7.9 billion. Of this amount, $5.5 billion, or 69%,
    bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.3%. Additionally, we
    had $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper and
    $1.4 billion of credit facility borrowings bearing interest
    at floating rates, which averaged 5.07% and 5.27%, respectively.
    At the end of 2007 and as of February 15, 2008, we did not
    have any interest rate hedging instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
    subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of
    such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional
    currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable
    exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues,
    expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange
    rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in
    the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not
    materially impact our December 31, 2007 balance sheet.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, comprehensive income,
    stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. We also
    have audited Devon Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Devon Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for these
    consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements
    included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also in our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    control criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
    subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
    conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The more significant of such policies
    are briefly discussed below.

Nature
    of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration,
    development and production, and the acquisition of properties.
    Such activities in the United States are concentrated in the
    following geographic areas:

•

the Mid-Continent area of the central and southern United
    States, principally in north and east Texas and Oklahoma;

•

the Permian Basin within Texas and New Mexico;

•

the Rocky Mountains area of the United States stretching from
    the Canadian border into northern New Mexico;

•

the offshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico; and

•

the onshore areas of the Gulf Coast, principally in south Texas
    and south Louisiana.

Devon’s Canadian operations are located primarily in the
    provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.
    Devon’s international operations — outside of
    North America — are located primarily in Azerbaijan,
    Brazil and China. In October 2007, Devon sold its assets and
    terminated its operations in Egypt. In January 2007, Devon
    announced its plans to divest its assets and terminate its
    operations in West Africa. These divestiture activities are
    described more fully in Note 13.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations that perform
    various activities to support the oil and gas operations of
    Devon as well as unrelated third parties. Such activities
    include marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, as well as
    constructing and operating pipelines, storage and treating
    facilities and gas processing plants.

The accounts of Devon’s controlled subsidiaries are
    included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include the following:

•

estimates of proved reserves and related estimates of the
    present value of future net revenues;

•

the carrying value of oil and gas properties;

•

estimates of the fair value of reporting units and related
    assessment of goodwill for impairment;

•

asset retirement obligations;

•

income taxes;

•

derivative financial instruments;



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

•

obligations related to employee benefits; and

•

legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Property
    and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
    gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
    acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
    properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
    and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
    incurred that are directly identified with acquisition,
    exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for
    its own account, and that are not related to production, general
    corporate overhead or similar activities, are also capitalized.
    Interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas
    properties under current evaluation and major development
    projects of oil and gas properties are also capitalized. All
    costs related to production activities, including workover costs
    incurred solely to maintain or increase levels of production
    from an existing completion interval, are charged to expense as
    incurred.

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
    oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
    limitation is the estimated after-tax future net revenues,
    discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil, natural gas and
    NGL reserves plus the cost of properties not subject to
    amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude future cash
    outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations
    included in the net book value of oil and gas properties. Such
    limitations are imposed separately on a

country-by-country

basis and are tested quarterly. In calculating future net
    revenues, prices and costs used are those as of the end of the
    appropriate quarterly period. These prices are not changed
    except where different prices are fixed and determinable from
    applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts,
    including derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment. None of Devon’s outstanding
    derivative contracts at December 31, 2007 or
    December 31, 2006 qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes,
    over the ceiling is written off as an expense. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Capitalized costs are depleted by an equivalent
    unit-of-production method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of
    six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil.
    Depletion is calculated using the capitalized costs, including
    estimated asset retirement costs, plus the estimated future
    expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in
    developing proved reserves, net of estimated salvage values.

Unproved properties are excluded from amortized capitalized
    costs until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can
    be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved
    properties for impairment quarterly. Significant unproved
    properties are assessed individually. Costs of insignificant
    unproved properties are transferred to amortizable costs over
    average holding periods ranging from three years for onshore
    properties to seven years for offshore properties.

No gain or loss is recognized upon disposal of oil and gas
    properties unless such disposal significantly alters the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in a
    particular country.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a
    units-of-production basis. Depreciation and amortization of
    other property and equipment, including corporate and other
    midstream assets and leasehold improvements, are provided using
    the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging
    from three to 39 years.

Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations
    associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing
    well sites, offshore production platforms, and midstream
    pipelines and processing plants when there is a legal obligation
    associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is
    recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting
    asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated
    property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. If the
    fair value of a recorded asset retirement obligation changes, a
    revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and
    the asset retirement cost. The asset retirement cost is
    depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to
    that used for the associated property and equipment.

Short-Term
    Investments and Other Marketable Securities

Devon reports its short-term investments and other marketable
    securities at fair value, except for debt securities in which
    management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. At
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, Devon’s short-term
    investments consisted of $372 million and
    $574 million, respectively, of auction rate securities
    classified as available for sale. Although Devon’s auction
    rate securities generally have contractual maturities of more
    than 20 years, the underlying interest rates on such
    securities are scheduled to reset every 28 days. Therefore,
    these auction rate securities are generally priced and
    subsequently trade as short-term investments because of the
    interest rate reset feature. As a result, Devon has classified
    its auction rate securities as short-term investments in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Devon owns approximately 14.2 million shares of Chevron
    Corporation (“Chevron”) common stock. The majority of
    these shares are held in connection with debt owed by Devon that
    contains an exchange option. This exchange option allows the
    debt holders, prior to the debt’s maturity of
    August 15, 2008, to exchange the debt for the shares of
    Chevron common stock owned by Devon. However, Devon has the
    option to settle any exchanges with cash equal to the market
    value of Chevron common stock at the time of the exchange. As
    described more fully in Note 4, Devon has paid the cash
    equivalent of the Chevron common stock to settle all exchange
    requests through December 31, 2007.

The shares of Chevron common stock and the exchange option
    embedded in the debt have always been recorded on Devon’s
    balance sheet at fair value. However, pursuant to accounting
    rules prior to January 1, 2007, only the change in fair
    value of the embedded option had historically been included in
    Devon’s results of operations. Conversely, the change in
    fair value of the Chevron common stock had not been included in
    Devon’s results of operations, but instead had been
    recorded directly to stockholders’ equity as part of
    “accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Effective January 1, 2007, Devon adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

. Statement No. 159 allows a company the
    option to value its financial assets and liabilities, on an
    instrument by instrument basis, at fair value, and include the
    change in fair value of such assets and liabilities in its
    results of operations. Devon chose to apply the provisions of
    Statement No. 159 to its shares of Chevron common stock.
    Accordingly, beginning with the first quarter of 2007, the
    change in fair value of the Chevron common stock owned by Devon,
    along with the change in fair value of the related exchange
    option, are both included in Devon’s results of operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the change in fair
    value of financial instruments caption on Devon’s statement
    of operations includes an unrealized gain of $281 million
    related to the Chevron common stock and an unrealized loss of
    $248 million related to the embedded option. For the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, prior to adopting
    Statement No. 159, unrealized losses of $181 million
    and $54 million, respectively, related to the change in
    fair value of the embedded option were included in the change in
    fair value of financial instruments caption on Devon’s
    statements of operations.

As of December 31, 2006, $364 million of after-tax
    unrealized gains related to Devon’s investment in the
    Chevron common stock was included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income. This is the amount of unrealized gains
    that, prior to Devon’s adoption of Statement No. 159,
    had not been recorded in Devon’s



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

historical results of operations. Upon the adoption of Statement
    No. 159 as of January 1, 2007, this $364 million
    of unrealized gains was reclassified on Devon’s balance
    sheet from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained
    earnings.

In conjunction with the adoption of Statement No. 159,
    Devon also adopted on January 1, 2007 Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

. Statement No. 157 provides a common
    definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements, but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. The adoption of Statement No. 157 had no
    impact on Devon’s financial statements, but the adoption
    did result in additional required disclosures as set forth in
    Note 5.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
    quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
    reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
    estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
    comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
    Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
    fourth quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005. Based on these
    assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
    assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.
    The increase in goodwill from 2006 to 2007 is largely due to
    changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
    the Canadian dollar.

Revenue
    Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold
    to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is transferred
    when production has been delivered to a pipeline or truck or a
    tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating to future
    production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by governmental
    authorities on oil, gas and NGL revenues are presented
    separately from such revenues as production taxes in the
    statement of operations.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining
    reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced
    owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The
    liability is priced based on current market prices. No
    receivables are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken
    less than its share of production unless all revenue recognition
    criteria are met. If an imbalance exists at



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

the time the wells’ reserves are depleted, settlements are
    made among the joint interest owners under a variety of
    arrangements.

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
    products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
    fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to
    Devon’s gas and NGL purchase and processing contracts are
    reported on a gross basis when Devon takes title to the products
    and has risks and rewards of ownership. The gas purchased under
    these contracts is processed in Devon-owned plants.

Major
    Purchasers

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, no purchaser accounted for more than
    10% of Devon’s revenues from continuing operations.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The majority of Devon’s derivative financial instruments
    consist of commodity financial instruments used to manage
    Devon’s cash flow exposure to oil and gas price volatility.
    Devon has also entered into interest rate swaps to manage its
    exposure to interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps
    mitigate either the cash flow effects of interest rate
    fluctuations on interest expense for variable-rate debt
    instruments, or the fair value effects of interest rate
    fluctuations on fixed-rate debt. Devon also has an embedded
    option derivative related to the fair value of its debentures
    exchangeable into shares of Chevron common stock.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value in the fair value of financial instruments
    caption on the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these
    derivative financial instruments are recorded in the statement
    of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    If such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If such criteria are met for
    fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is recorded in
    the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded
    for the change in fair value of the hedged item.

A derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment if Devon designates the instrument as such on the date
    the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a
    business combination or other transaction that includes
    derivative contracts. Additionally, Devon must document the
    relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking the instrument. Devon must also assess, both at the
    instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash
    flow of the hedged item.

During 2007 and 2006, Devon entered into and acquired certain
    commodity derivative instruments. For such instruments, Devon
    chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify these
    derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment.
    Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the changes in fair value related to these instruments were
    recorded to gas sales in the statements of operations. Such
    amounts recorded were a $25 million loss and a
    $37 million gain in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The change in the fair value of the embedded option relates to
    the debentures exchangeable into shares of Chevron common stock
    (see Note 4). These unrealized losses were caused primarily
    by increases in the price of Chevron’s common stock.

As previously discussed in the Short-Term Investments and Other
    Marketable Securities section of Note 1, beginning in 2007,
    the change in fair value of the Chevron common stock owned by
    Devon is included in Devon’s results of operations rather
    than accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain
    on this investment resulted from the increase in the price of
    Chevron’s common stock.

In addition to the changes in fair value of Devon’s
    interest rate swaps presented in the table above, settlements on
    these interest rate swaps increased interest expense by
    $4 million, $14 million and $10 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

During 2005, Devon had a number of commodity derivative
    instruments that qualified for hedge accounting treatment as
    described above. During 2005, certain of these derivatives
    ceased to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In the third
    quarter of 2005, certain oil derivatives ceased to qualify for
    hedge accounting primarily as a result of deferred production
    caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Because these
    contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting, Devon
    recognized $39 million in losses as change in fair value of
    derivative financial instruments in the accompanying
    2005 statement of operations.

In addition to the changes in fair value of non-qualifying
    commodity hedges presented in the table above, Devon also
    recognized in 2005 a $55 million loss related to certain
    oil hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to
    the effect of the 2005 property divestiture program. These
    commodity instruments related to 5,000 barrels per day of
    U.S. oil production and 3,000 barrels per day of
    Canadian oil production from properties that were sold as part
    of Devon’s divestiture program. This loss is presented in
    other income in the 2005 statement of operations.

The following table presents the balances of Devon’s
    accumulated net gain (loss) on cash flow hedges included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (in millions).

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
    changes in commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes
    itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the
    failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
    derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging
    instruments are placed



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

with counterparties that Devon believes are minimal credit
    risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative
    contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed
    by management to be competent and competitive market makers.

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative financial
    instrument that results from a change in commodity prices,
    interest rates or other relevant underlyings. The market risk
    associated with commodity price and interest rate contracts is
    managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the
    types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. The oil
    and gas reference prices upon which the commodity hedging
    instruments are based reflect various market indices that have a
    high degree of historical correlation with actual prices
    received by Devon. Devon does not hold or issue derivative
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Stock
    Options

Effective January 1, 2006, Devon adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

, (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), using the
    modified prospective transition method.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires equity-classified,
    share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
    stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant
    and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Under the
    modified prospective transition method, share-based awards
    granted or modified on or after January 1, 2006, are
    recognized in compensation expense over the applicable vesting
    period. Also, any previously granted awards that were not fully
    vested as of January 1, 2006 are recognized as compensation
    expense over the remaining vesting period. No retroactive or
    cumulative effect adjustments were required upon Devon’s
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to adopting SFAS No. 123(R), Devon accounted for
    its fixed-plan employee stock options using the intrinsic-value
    based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

(“APB No. 25”) and related interpretations.
    This method required compensation expense to be recorded on the
    date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying
    stock exceeded the exercise price.

Had the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) been
    applied in 2005, Devon’s 2005 net earnings and net
    earnings per share would have differed from the amounts actually
    reported as shown in the following table (in millions, except
    per share amounts).

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Devon
    presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the
    exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in the
    statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R)



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

requires the cash inflows resulting from tax deductions in
    excess of the compensation expense recognized for those stock
    options (“excess tax benefits”) to be classified as
    financing cash inflows. As required by
    SFAS No. 123(R), Devon recognized $44 million and
    $36 million of excess tax benefits as financing cash
    inflows for 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2005, excess tax
    benefits of $44 million were classified as operating cash
    inflows.

Income
    Taxes

Devon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal
    and various state jurisdictions in the United States and by
    other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for
    deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions using the
    asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
    consequences attributable to differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized
    for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected
    utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and
    other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
    settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
    change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
    includes the enactment date.

At December 31, 2007, undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries included in continuing operations were determined
    to be permanently reinvested. Therefore, no U.S. deferred
    income taxes were provided on such amounts at December 31,
    2007. If it becomes apparent that some or all of the
    undistributed earnings will be distributed, Devon would then
    record taxes on those earnings.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Interpretation No. 48 prescribes a threshold for
    recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position
    when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits,
    that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing
    authority. Recognized tax positions are initially and
    subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that
    is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits related to such tax positions are included in other
    long-term liabilities unless the tax position is expected to be
    settled within the upcoming year, in which case the liabilities
    are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    included in income tax expense.

On January 1, 2007, Devon adopted Interpretation
    No. 48 and recorded an $11 million reduction to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings related to
    unrecognized tax benefits. The $11 million included
    $8 million for related interest and penalties. An
    additional $3 million of liabilities were recorded with a
    corresponding increase to goodwill.

As a result of the adoption of Interpretation No. 48,
    certain liabilities included in income taxes payable and
    deferred income taxes were reclassified to other current and
    long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. The
    total $14 million increase in liabilities included a
    $17 million increase to long-term liabilities, partially
    offset by a $3 million reduction to current liabilities.

Additional information regarding Devon’s unrecognized tax
    benefits, including changes in such amounts during 2007, is
    provided in Note 12.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
    reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
    properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
    pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Net
    Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings
    per share, as calculated using the treasury stock method,
    reflects the potential dilution that could occur if Devon’s
    dilutive outstanding stock options were exercised. For 2005, the
    calculation of diluted shares also assumed that Devon’s
    previously outstanding zero coupon convertible senior debentures
    were converted to common stock.

The following table reconciles earnings from continuing
    operations and common shares outstanding used in the
    calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2007,

Foreign
    Currency Translation Adjustments

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devon’s
    consolidated operations except its Canadian subsidiaries, which
    use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore,
    the assets and liabilities of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated into U.S. dollars based on the current
    exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Canadian
    income and expenses are translated at average rates for the
    periods presented. Translation adjustments have no effect on net
    income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income in stockholders’ equity. The following table

Statements
    of Cash Flows

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Devon
    considers all highly liquid investments with original
    contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
    assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for environmental
    remediation or restoration claims are recorded when it is
    probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Expenditures related to such
    environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance
    with Devon’s accounting policy for property and equipment.
    Reference is made to Note 8 for a discussion of amounts
    recorded for these liabilities.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

, which
    replaces Statement No. 141. Statement No. 141(R)
    retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141
    that an acquirer be identified and the acquisition method of
    accounting (previously called the purchase method) be used for
    all business combinations. Statement No. 141(R)’s
    scope is broader than that of Statement No. 141, which
    applied only to business combinations in which control was
    obtained by transferring consideration. By applying the
    acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    Statement No. 141(R) improves the comparability of the
    information about business combinations provided in financial
    reports. Statement No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, as well as any
    resulting goodwill. Statement No. 141(R) applies
    prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Devon will
    evaluate how the new requirements of Statement No. 141(R)
    would impact any business combinations completed in 2009 or
    thereafter.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

. A
    noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest,
    is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,
    directly or indirectly, to a parent. Statement No. 160
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Under Statement No. 160,
    noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary must be reported as a
    component of



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    (Continued)

consolidated equity separate from the parent’s equity.
    Additionally, the amounts of consolidated net income
    attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest
    must be reported separately on the face of the income statement.
    Statement No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
    prohibited. Devon does not expect the adoption of Statement
    No. 160 to have a material impact on its financial
    statements and related disclosures.

Chief
    Acquisition

On June 29, 2006, Devon acquired the oil and gas assets of
    privately-owned Chief Holdings LLC (“Chief”). Devon
    paid $2.0 billion in cash and assumed approximately
    $0.2 billion of net liabilities in the transaction for a
    total purchase price of $2.2 billion. Devon funded the
    acquisition price, and the immediate retirement of
    $180 million of assumed debt, with $718 million of
    cash on hand and approximately $1.4 billion of borrowings
    issued under its commercial paper program. The acquired oil and
    gas properties consisted of 99.7 MMBoe (unaudited) of
    proved reserves and leasehold totaling 169,000 net acres
    located in the Barnett Shale area of north Texas. Devon
    allocated approximately $1.0 billion of the purchase price
    to proved reserves and approximately $1.2 billion to
    unproved properties.

Property
    Divestitures

In November 2006 and January 2007, Devon announced plans to

During 2007 and 2006, Devon recognized a $311 million and
    $135 million revision to its asset retirement obligation,
    respectively. The primary factors causing the 2007 fair value
    increase were an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates
    and an increase in the assumed inflation rate. The effect of
    these factors was partially offset by the effect of an increase
    in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the
    obligations. The primary factor causing the 2006 fair value
    increase was an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates.

Credit
    Lines

Devon has two revolving lines of credit that can be accessed to
    provide liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, Devon’s
    combined available capacity under these credit facilities, net
    of $198 million of outstanding letters of credit and
    $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper, was
    $1.3 billion.

Devon’s $2.5 billion five-year, syndicated, unsecured
    revolving line of credit (the “Senior Credit
    Facility”) matures on April 7, 2012, and all amounts
    outstanding will be due and payable at that time unless the
    maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7 anniversary date,
    Devon has the option to extend the maturity of the Senior Credit
    Facility for one year, subject to the approval of the lenders.

The Senior Credit Facility includes a five-year revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million. Amounts borrowed under the Senior
    Credit Facility may, at the election of Devon, bear interest at
    various fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months.
    Such rates are generally less than the prime rate. However,
    Devon may elect to borrow at the prime rate. The Senior Credit
    Facility currently provides for an annual facility fee of
    $1.8 million that is payable quarterly in arrears. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were $1.4 billion of
    borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility at an average rate
    of 5.27%.

On August 7, 2007, Devon established a new
    $1.5 billion

364-day,

syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the
    “Short-Term Facility”). This facility provides Devon
    with provisional interim liquidity until the proceeds from
    divestitures of assets in Africa are received. The Short-Term
    Facility was also used to support an increase in Devon’s
    commercial paper program from $2 billion to
    $3.5 billion.

The Short-Term Facility matures on August 5, 2008. At that
    time, all amounts outstanding will be due and payable unless the
    maturity is extended. Prior to August 5, 2008, Devon has
    the option to convert any outstanding principal amount of loans
    under the Short-Term Facility to a term loan that will be
    repayable in a single payment on August 4, 2009.

Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Facility bear interest at
    various fixed rate options for periods of up to 12 months.
    Such rates are generally less than the prime rate. Devon may
    also elect to borrow at the prime rate. The Short-Term Facility
    currently provides for an annual facility fee of approximately
    $0.8 million that is payable quarterly in arrears. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings under the
    Short-Term Facility.

The Senior Credit Facility and Short-Term Facility contain only
    one material financial covenant. This covenant requires
    Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization
    to be less than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions
    of total funded debt and total capitalization that include
    adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the
    consolidated financial statements. As defined in the agreement,
    total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable
    into shares of Chevron common stock. Also, total capitalization
    is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as
    full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of
    December 31, 2007, Devon was in compliance with this
    covenant. Devon’s debt-to-capitalization ratio at
    December 31, 2007, as calculated pursuant to the terms of
    the agreement, was 23.8%.

Commercial
    Paper

Devon also has access to short-term credit under its commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $3.5 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility or the Short-Term Facility on a
    dollar-for-dollar basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a
    maturity of between one and 90 days, although it can have a
    maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates
    agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is
    based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR,
    or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper
    market. As of December 31, 2007, Devon had
    $1.0 billion of commercial paper debt outstanding at an
    average rate of 5.07%. The average borrowing rate for
    Devon’s $1.8 billion of



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

commercial paper debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 was
    5.37%. Outstanding commercial paper is classified as short-term
    debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Exchangeable
    Debentures

The exchangeable debentures consist of $381 million of
    4.90% debentures and $271 million of
    4.95% debentures. The exchangeable debentures were issued
    on August 3, 1998 and mature August 15, 2008. The
    exchangeable debentures are callable at 100.5% of principal as
    of December 31, 2007.

The exchangeable debentures are exchangeable at the option of
    the holders at any time prior to maturity, unless previously
    redeemed, for shares of Chevron common stock that Devon owns. In
    lieu of delivering Chevron common stock to an exchanging
    debenture holder, Devon may, at its option, pay to such holder
    an amount of cash equal to the market value of the Chevron
    common stock. At maturity, holders who have not exercised their
    exchange rights will receive an amount in cash equal to the
    principal amount of the debentures.

During 2007, certain holders of exchangeable debentures
    exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares
    of Chevron common stock prior to the debentures’
    August 15, 2008 maturity date. Devon elected to pay the
    exchanging debenture holders cash totaling $167 million in
    lieu of delivering shares of Chevron common stock. As a result
    of these exchanges, Devon retired outstanding exchangeable
    debentures with a book value totaling $105 million and
    reduced the related embedded derivative option’s balance by
    $62 million.

As of December 31, 2007, Devon owned approximately
    14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock. The majority
    of these shares are held for possible exchange when holders
    redeem their exchangeable debentures. Each $1,000 principal
    amount of the exchangeable debentures is exchangeable into
    18.6566 shares of Chevron common stock, an exchange rate
    equivalent to $53.60 per share of Chevron stock.

As of December 31, 2007, the exchangeable debentures are
    due within one year. However, Devon continues to classify this
    debt as long-term because it has the intent and ability to
    refinance these debentures on a long-term basis with the
    available capacity under its existing credit facilities or other
    long-tem financing arrangements.

The exchangeable debentures were assumed as part of the 1999
    acquisition of PennzEnergy. As a result, the fair values of the
    exchangeable debentures were determined as of August 17,
    1999, based on market quotations. In accordance with derivative
    accounting standards, the total fair value of the debentures was
    allocated between the interest-bearing debt and the option to
    exchange Chevron common stock that is embedded in the
    debentures. Accordingly, a discount was recorded on the
    debentures and is being accreted using the effective interest
    method, which raised the effective interest rate on the
    debentures to 7.76%.

    Debentures and Notes

Following are descriptions of the various other debentures and
    notes outstanding at December 31, 2007, as listed in the

Ocean
    Debt

As a result of the merger with Ocean Energy, Inc., which closed
    April 25, 2003, Devon assumed $1.8 billion of debt.
    The table below summarizes the debt assumed that remains
    outstanding, the fair value of the debt at April 25, 2003,
    and the effective interest rate of the debt assumed after
    determining the fair values of the respective notes using
    April 25, 2003, market interest rates. The premiums
    resulting from fair values exceeding face values are being
    amortized using the effective interest method. All of the notes
    are general unsecured obligations of Devon.

Statement No. 157 (see Note 1) establishes a fair
    value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value. As presented in the table
    above, this hierarchy consists of three broad levels.
    Level 1 inputs on the hierarchy consist of unadjusted
    quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
    liabilities and have the highest priority. Level 3 inputs
    have the lowest priority. Devon uses appropriate valuation
    techniques based on the available inputs to measure the fair
    values of its assets and liabilities. When available, Devon
    measures fair value using Level 1 inputs because they
    generally provide the most reliable



DEVON

NOTES TO

evidence of fair value. Devon only uses Level 3 inputs to
    measure the fair value of its asset retirement obligation.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
    fair values of the assets and liabilities in the table above.

Level 1
    Fair Value Measurements

Short-term Investments

— The fair values of
    these investments are based on quoted market prices.
    Devon’s short-term investments as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006 consisted entirely of auction rate securities. All such
    securities held at December 31, 2007 were collateralized by
    student loans which are substantially guaranteed by the United
    States government. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, Devon
    has reduced its auction rate securities holdings to
    $153 million. However, beginning on February 8, 2008,
    Devon experienced difficulty selling certain of the securities
    due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provides
    liquidity to these securities. An auction failure means that the
    parties wishing to sell securities could not do so. The
    securities for which auctions have failed will continue to
    accrue interest and be auctioned every 28 days until the
    auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or the
    securities mature. Accordingly, there may be no effective
    mechanism for selling these securities, and the securities Devon
    owns may become long-term investments. At this time, Devon does
    not believe its auction rate securities are impaired or that the
    failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on
    its liquidity.

Investment in Chevron Corporation common
    stock

— The fair value of this investment is based
    on a quoted market price.

Debt

— Certain of the fixed-rate debt
    instruments actively trade in an established market. The fair
    values of this debt are based on quotes obtained from brokers.

Level 2
    Fair Value Measurements

Oil and gas price swaps and collars

— The fair
    values of the oil and gas price swaps and collars are estimated
    using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon
    forward commodity price curves, quotes obtained from brokers for
    contracts with similar terms or quotes obtained from
    counterparties to the agreements.

Embedded option in exchangeable debentures

—
    The embedded option is not actively traded in an established
    market. Therefore, its fair value is estimated using quotes
    obtained from a broker for trades near the fair value
    measurement date.

Debt

— Certain of the fixed-rate debt
    instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The
    fair values of this debt are estimated by discounting the
    principal and interest payments at rates available for debt with
    similar terms and maturity. The fair values of floating-rate
    debt are estimated to approximate the carrying amounts because
    the interest rates paid on such debt are generally set for
    periods of three months or less.

Interest rate swaps

— The fair values of the
    interest rate swaps are estimated using internal discounted cash
    flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves
    or quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements.

Level 3
    Fair Value Measurements

Asset retirement obligation

— The fair values
    of the asset retirement obligations are estimated using internal
    discounted cash flow calculations based upon Devon’s
    estimates of future retirement costs. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending balances of Devon’s asset retirement
    obligation, including a revision of the estimated fair value in
    2007 and 2006, is presented in Note 3.

Retirement
    Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
    and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
    Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for U.S. and
    Canadian employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
    Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
    employees’ years of service and compensation and are funded
    from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

Devon’s funding policy regarding the Qualified Plans is to
    contribute the amount of funds necessary so that the Qualified
    Plans’ assets will be approximately equal to the related
    accumulated benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the fair values of the Qualified Plans’ assets were
    $619 million and $590 million, respectively, which
    were $62 million and $59 million more, respectively,
    than the related accumulated benefit obligation. The actual
    amount of contributions required during future periods will
    depend on investment returns from the plan assets during the
    same period as well as changes in long-term interest rates.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
    employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
    by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
    are based on the employees’ years of service and
    compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
    established trusts to fund these plans’ benefit
    obligations. The total value of these trusts was
    $59 million at both December 31, 2007 and 2006, and is
    included in noncurrent other assets in the consolidated balance
    sheets. For the remaining Supplemental Plans for which trusts
    have not been established, benefits are funded from Devon’s
    available cash and cash equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
    (“Postretirement Plans”) that provide benefits for
    substantially all U.S. employees. The Postretirement Plans
    provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and
    are, depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
    non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
    Plans are estimated based on Devon’s future cost-sharing
    intentions. Devon’s funding policy for the Postretirement
    Plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with
    available cash and cash equivalents.

Revisions
    to Retirement Plans

In the second quarter of 2007, Devon adopted an enhanced defined
    contribution structure related to its 401(k) Incentive Savings
    Plan (“401(k) Plan”) to be effective January 1,
    2008. Participants in this enhanced defined contribution
    structure will continue to receive a discretionary match of a
    percentage of their contributions to the 401(k) Plan. These
    participants will also receive additional, nondiscretionary
    contributions by Devon calculated as a percentage of annual
    compensation. The percentage will vary based on the
    employees’ years of service.

On or before November 15, 2007, existing eligible employees
    elected to either continue to participate in the defined benefit
    plan or participate in the enhanced defined contribution
    structure of the 401(k) Plan. Employees who elected to continue
    participating in the defined benefit plans will continue to
    accrue benefits under the existing provisions of such plans.
    Employees who elected to participate in the enhanced defined
    contribution structure will receive enhanced contributions to
    the 401(k) Plan and will retain the benefits that they have
    accrued under the defined benefit plan as of December 31,
    2007. However, such employees will only be entitled to the
    benefits that have accrued in the defined benefit plans as of
    December 31, 2007, after all applicable vesting
    requirements have been met. Employees hired on or after
    October 1, 2007 will not have an election and will only
    participate in the 401(k) Plan and the enhanced defined
    contribution structure.

For those employees who elected to participate in the enhanced
    defined contribution structure, Devon’s pension benefit
    obligation included $16 million related to projected future
    years of service for these



DEVON

employees. Because this portion of the employees’ benefits
    was curtailed upon their election, Devon reduced its pension
    liabilities by $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Change
    in Measurement Date

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R)

. Statement No. 158 requires the
    measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the
    date of the employer’s fiscal year-end, beginning with
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Although not
    required until 2008, Devon adopted this measurement-date
    requirement in the second quarter of 2007 and changed its
    measurement date from November 30 to December 31. As a
    result, Devon used data as of December 31, 2006 to
    remeasure its plans assets and benefit obligations previously
    measured using data as of November 30, 2006. As a result of
    the remeasurement, Devon recognized the following amounts in the
    second quarter of 2007.

    benefit obligation for pension plans represents the projected
    benefit obligation, while the benefit obligation for the
    postretirement benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit
    obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the
    projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no
    assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated
    benefit obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2007
    and 2006 was $693 million and $652 million,

Discount rate

— Future pension and
    postretirement obligations are discounted at the end of each
    year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively
    settled, considering the timing of estimated future cash flows
    related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond
    yields, after allowing for call and default risk. High quality
    corporate bond yield indices, such as Moody’s Aa, are
    considered when selecting the discount rate.

Rate of compensation increase

— For measurement
    of the 2007 benefit obligation for the pension plans, the 7%
    compensation increase in the table above represents the assumed
    increase for 2008 through 2011. The rate was assumed to decrease
    to 5% in the year 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. For
    measurement of the 2006 benefit obligation for the pension
    plans, the 7% compensation increase in the table above
    represents the assumed increase for 2007 and 2008. The rate was
    assumed to decrease one percent annually to 5% in the year 2010
    and remain at that level thereafter. For measurement of the 2005
    benefit obligation for the pension plans, the compensation
    increase in the table above represents the assumed increase for
    all future years.

Expected return on plan assets

— Devon’s
    overall investment objective for its retirement plans’
    assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested capital to
    ensure payments of retirement benefits obligations can be funded
    when required. To assist in achieving this objective, Devon has
    established certain investment strategies, including target
    allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments,
    designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. At
    December 31, 2007, the target investment allocation for
    Devon’s plan assets was 50% U.S. large cap equity
    securities; 15% U.S. small cap equity securities, equally
    allocated between growth and value; 15% international equity
    securities, equally allocated between growth and value; and 20%
    debt securities. Derivatives or other speculative investments
    considered high-risk are generally prohibited.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by
    evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. Devon expects the
    long-term asset allocation to approximate the targeted
    allocation. Therefore, the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is based on the target allocation of investment
    types in such assets.

Other assumptions

— For measurement of the 2007
    benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans,
    an 8.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered health care benefits was assumed for 2008. The rate was
    assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of 5% in the
    year 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health
    care cost-trend rates affect the amounts reported for retiree
    health care costs. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
    health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on
    the December 31, 2007 other postretirement benefits
    obligation and the 2008 service and interest cost components of
    net periodic benefit cost.

Other
    Benefit Plans

Devon’s 401(k) Plan covers all domestic employees. At its
    discretion, Devon may match a certain percentage of the
    employees’ contributions to the plan. The matching
    percentage is determined annually by the Board of Directors.
    Devon’s matching contributions to the plan were
    $18 million, $15 million and $12 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As previously discussed in “Revisions to Retirement
    Plans” above, in 2007 Devon adopted an enhanced defined
    contribution structure related to its 401(k) Plan to be
    effective January 1, 2008. Participants who elected to
    participate in this enhanced defined contribution structure, as
    well as all employees hired on or after October 1, 2007,
    will continue to receive a discretionary match of a percentage
    of their contributions to the 401(k) Plan. These participants
    will also receive additional, nondiscretionary contributions by
    Devon calculated as a percentage of annual compensation. The
    percentage will vary based on the employees’ years of
    service.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
    employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee that is
    based upon the employee’s base compensation and
    classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
    amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
    has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
    plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
    employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
    percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
    additional Devon contributions. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    Devon’s combined contributions to the Canadian defined
    contribution plan and the Canadian savings plan were
    $14 million, $12 million and $10 million,
    respectively.

Stockholders’
    Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of
    800 million shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per
    share, and 4.5 million shares of preferred stock, par value
    $1.00 per share. The preferred stock may be issued in one or
    more series, and the terms and rights of such stock will be
    determined by the Board of Directors.

Effective August 17, 1999, Devon issued 1.5 million
    shares of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock, Series A, to
    holders of PennzEnergy 6.49% cumulative preferred stock,
    Series A. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative
    from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly, in
    cash, when declared by the Board of Directors. The preferred
    stock is redeemable at the option of Devon at any time on or
    after June 2, 2008, in whole or in part, at a redemption
    price of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to
    the redemption date.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated a certain number
    of shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock”) in connection with the adoption of the
    shareholder rights plan described later in this note. On
    April 25, 2003, the Board increased the designated shares
    from 2.0 million to 2.9 million. At December 31,
    2007, there were no shares of Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock issued or outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock is entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per
    share equal to the greater of $1.00 or 200 times the aggregate
    per share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends)
    declared on common stock since the immediately preceding
    quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first
    payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock are entitled to 200 votes per share (subject to adjustment
    to prevent dilution) on all matters submitted to a vote of the
    stockholders. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
    neither redeemable nor convertible. The Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but junior to
    all other classes of Preferred Stock.

Stock
    Repurchases

In June 2007, Devon’s Board of Directors approved an
    ongoing, annual stock repurchase program to minimize dilution
    resulting from restricted stock issued to, and options exercised
    by, employees. This repurchase program authorized the repurchase
    of up to 4.5 million shares in 2007. In 2008, the ongoing
    annual stock repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of up
    to 4.8 million shares or $422 million, whichever
    amount is reached first. In anticipation of the completion of
    the West African divestitures (see Note 13), Devon’s
    Board of Directors has approved a separate program to repurchase
    up to 50 million shares. This program expires on
    December 31, 2009.

These programs are in addition to a 50 million share
    repurchase program approved by Devon’s Board of Directors
    in August 2005, which expired on December 31, 2007.
    Additionally, in October 2004 Devon’s Board of Directors
    approved a 50 million share repurchase program that was
    completed in August 2005.

During the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, Devon
    repurchased 55.2 million shares at a total cost of
    $2.8 billion, or $51.49 per share, under these repurchase
    programs. During 2007, Devon repurchased 4.1 million shares
    at a cost of $326 million, or $79.80 per share. During
    2006, Devon repurchased 4.2 million shares at a cost of
    $253 million, or $59.61 per share. During 2005, Devon
    repurchased 46.9 million shares at a cost of
    $2.3 billion, or $48.28 per share.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

Under Devon’s shareholder rights plan, stockholders have
    one-half of one right for each share of common stock held. The
    rights become exercisable and separately transferable ten
    business days after (a) an announcement that a person has
    acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
    voting shares outstanding, or (b) commencement of a tender
    or exchange offer that could result in a person owning 15% or
    more of the voting shares outstanding.

Each right entitles its holder (except a holder who is the
    acquiring person) to purchase either (a) 1/100 of a share
    of Series A Preferred Stock for $185.00, subject to
    adjustment or, (b) Devon common stock with a value equal to
    twice the exercise price of the right, subject to adjustment to
    prevent dilution. In the event of certain merger or asset sale
    transactions with another party or transactions that would
    increase the equity ownership of a shareholder who then owned
    15% or more of Devon, each Devon right will entitle its holder
    to purchase securities of the merging or acquiring party with a
    value equal to twice the exercise price of the right.

The rights, which have no voting power, expire on
    August 17, 2009. The rights may be redeemed by Devon for
    $0.01 per right until the rights become exercisable.

Dividends

Devon paid common stock dividends of $249 million (or $0.56
    per share), $199 million (or $0.45 per share) and
    $136 million (or $0.30 per share) in 2007, 2006 and 2005
    respectively. Devon paid $10 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005
    to preferred stockholders.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
    course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
    outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
    accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
    matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters
    and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
    similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management
    to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s
    financial position or results of operations after



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could
    differ materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental
    Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
    environmental remediation activities associated with past
    operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
    state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these
    activities, accruals have been established when reasonable
    estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include
    estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used
    discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for
    environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible
    recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to
    environmental costs have been recognized in Devon’s
    consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals
    when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
    probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation
    estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of Devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers
    are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
    subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
    (“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
    with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
    by third parties. As of December 31, 2007, Devon’s
    balance sheet included $3 million of noncurrent accrued
    liabilities, reflected in other liabilities, related to these
    and other environmental remediation liabilities. Devon does not
    currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring
    additional material costs in excess of the current accruals
    recognized for such environmental remediation activities. With
    respect to the sites in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs,
    Devon’s conclusion is based in large part on
    (i) Devon’s participation in consent decrees with both
    other PRPs and the Environmental Protection Agency, which
    provide for performing the scope of work required for
    remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to
    the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as a

de minimis

PRP

,

and (iii) the availability of other
    defenses to liability. As a result, Devon’s monetary
    exposure is not expected to be material.

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
    have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
    federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
    and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from
    federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The principal suit
    in which Devon is a defendant is

United States ex rel.
    Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al.

(the “Wright
    case”). The suit was originally filed in August 1996 in the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
    but was consolidated in October 2000 with other suits for
    pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for
    the District of Wyoming. On July 10, 2003, the District of
    Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to the Eastern District of
    Texas to resume proceedings. On April 12, 2007, the court
    entered a trial plan and scheduling order in which the case will
    proceed in phases. Two phases have been scheduled to date, with
    the first scheduled to begin in August 2008 and the second
    scheduled to begin in February 2009. Devon is not included in
    the groups of defendants selected for these first two phases.
    Devon believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and
    strong defenses to all allegations in the suit, and has paid
    royalties in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that
    it is subject to material exposure in association with this
    lawsuit and no liability has been recorded in connection
    therewith.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act. The intent of this legislation was to
    encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico by
    providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain
    federal leases. Deep water leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) have contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

natural gas exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty
    relief would not be granted for that year. Deep water leases
    issued in 1998 and 1999 did not include price thresholds. The
    MMS in 2006 informed Devon and other oil and gas companies that
    the omission of price thresholds from these leases was an error
    on its part and was not its intention. Accordingly, the MMS
    invited Devon and the other affected oil and gas producers to
    renegotiate the terms and conditions of the 1998 and 1999 leases
    to add price threshold provisions to the lease agreements for
    periods after October 1, 2006. Devon has not entered into
    any renegotiated leases.

The U.S. House of Representatives in January 2007 passed
    legislation that would have required companies to renegotiate
    the 1998 and 1999 leases as a condition of securing future
    federal leases. This legislation was not passed by the
    U.S. Senate. However, Congress may consider similar
    legislation in the future. Although Devon has not signed
    renegotiated leases, it has accrued in its 2007 financial
    statements approximately $28 million for royalties that
    would be due if price thresholds were added to its 1998 and 1999
    leases effective October 1, 2006.

Additionally, Devon has $22 million accrued at the end of
    2007 for royalties related to leases issued under the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act in years other than 1998 or 1999. The leases
    issued in these other years did include price thresholds, but in
    October 2007 a federal district court ruled in favor of a
    plaintiff who had challenged the legality of including price
    thresholds in these leases. This judgment is subject to appeal,
    and Devon will continue to accrue for royalties on these leases
    until the matter is resolved.

Hurricane
    Contingencies

Historically, Devon maintained a comprehensive insurance program
    that included coverage for physical damage to its offshore
    facilities caused by hurricanes. Devon’s historical
    insurance program also included substantial business
    interruption coverage, which Devon is utilizing to recover costs
    associated with the suspended production related to hurricanes
    that struck the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter of 2005.
    Under the terms of this insurance program, Devon was entitled to
    be reimbursed for the portion of production suspended longer
    than forty-five days, subject to upper limits to oil and natural
    gas prices. Also, the terms of the insurance include a standard,
    per-event deductible of $1 million for offshore losses as
    well as a $15 million aggregate annual deductible.

Based on current estimates of physical damage and the
    anticipated length of time Devon will have had production
    suspended, Devon expects its policy recoveries will exceed
    repair costs and deductible amounts. This expectation is based
    upon several variables, including the $467 million received
    in 2006 as a full settlement of the amount due from Devon’s
    primary insurers and $13 million received in 2007 as a full
    settlement of the amount due from certain of Devon’s
    secondary insurers. As of December 31, 2007,
    $330 million of these proceeds had been utilized as
    reimbursement of past repair costs and deductible amounts. The
    remaining proceeds of $150 million will be utilized as
    reimbursement of Devon’s anticipated future repair costs.
    Devon continues to negotiate with its other secondary insurers
    and expects to receive additional policy recoveries as a result
    of such negotiations.

Should Devon’s total policy recoveries, including the
    partial settlements already received from Devon’s primary
    and secondary insurers, exceed all repair costs and deductible
    amounts, such excess will be recognized as other income in the
    statement of operations in the period in which such
    determination can be made.

The policy underlying the insurance program terms described
    above expired on August 31, 2006. Devon’s current
    insurance program includes business interruption and physical
    damage coverage for its business. However, due to significant
    changes in the insurance marketplace, Devon has only been able
    to obtain a

de minimis

amount of coverage for any damage
    that may be caused by named windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.
    Devon has not experienced any losses under this new insurance
    arrangement through December 31, 2007.

Other
    Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge
    as of the date of this report, there were no other material
    pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which
    any of its property is subject.

Commitments

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under
    contractual agreements with third party service providers to
    procure drilling rigs and other related services for
    developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities
    construction. Included in the $3.9 billion total of
    “Drilling and Facility Obligations” in the table below
    is $2.4 billion that relates to long-term contracts for
    three deepwater drilling rigs and certain other contracts for
    onshore drilling and facility obligations in which drilling or
    facilities construction has not commenced. The $2.4 billion
    represents the gross commitment under these contracts.
    Devon’s ultimate payment for these commitments will be
    reduced by the amounts billed to its partners when net working
    interests are ultimately determined. Payments for these
    commitments, net of amounts billed to partners, will be
    capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties.

Devon has certain firm transportation agreements that represent
    “ship or pay” arrangements whereby Devon has committed
    to ship certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed
    transportation fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to
    aid the movement of its production to market. Devon expects to
    have sufficient production to utilize the majority of these
    transportation services.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
    lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
    administrative expenses under operating leases, net of sub-lease
    income, was $43 million, $36 million and
    $35 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003
    Ocean merger. The spars are being used in the development of the
    Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Boomvang
    field was divested as part of the 2005 property divestiture
    program. The Nansen operating lease is for a

20-year

term
    and contains various options whereby Devon may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spar. Total rental expense
    included in lease operating expenses under both the Nansen and
    Boomvang operating leases was $12 million, $12 million
    and $14 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Devon
    has guaranteed that the Nansen spar will have a residual value
    at the end of the operating lease equal to at least 10% of the
    fair value of the spar at the inception of the lease. The total
    guaranteed value is $14 million in 2022. However, such
    amount may be reduced under the terms of the lease agreement. As
    a result of the sale of the Boomvang field, Devon is subleasing
    the Boomvang Spar. If the sublessee were to default on its
    obligation, Devon would continue to be obligated to pay the
    periodic lease payments and any guaranteed value required at the
    end of the term.

Devon has a floating, production, storage and offloading
    facility (“FPSO”) that is being used in the Panyu
    project offshore China and is being leased under operating lease
    arrangements. This lease expires in September 2009. Devon also
    has an FPSO that is being used in the Polvo project offshore
    Brazil. This lease expires in 2014. Total rental expense
    included in lease operating expenses under the China and Brazil
    operating leases was $17 million, $9 million and
    $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum payments
    for drilling and facility obligations, firm transportation
    agreements and leases that have initial or remaining
    noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
    December 31, 2007. The schedule includes $144 million
    of drilling and facility obligations related to Devon’s
    discontinued operations (see Note 13).

Share-Based
    Compensation

On June 8, 2005, Devon’s stockholders adopted the 2005
    Long-Term Incentive Plan, which expires on June 8, 2013.
    Devon’s stockholders adopted certain amendments to this
    plan on June 7, 2006. This plan, as amended, authorizes the
    Compensation Committee, which consists of non-management members
    of Devon’s Board of Directors, to grant nonqualified and
    incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, Canadian
    restricted stock units, performance units, performance bonuses,
    stock appreciation rights and cash-out rights to eligible
    employees. The plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified
    stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation
    rights to directors. A total of 32 million shares of Devon
    common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the
    plan. To calculate shares issued under the plan, options granted
    represent one share and other awards represent 2.2 shares.

Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2003 and
    1997 under which stock options and restricted stock awards were
    issued to key management and professional employees. Options
    granted under these plans remain exercisable by the employees
    owning such options, but no new options or restricted stock
    awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has stock
    options outstanding that were assumed as part of the
    acquisitions of Ocean, Mitchell Energy & Development
    Corp., Santa Fe Snyder and PennzEnergy.

As discussed in Note 1, on January 1, 2006, Devon
    changed its method of accounting for share-based compensation
    from the APB No. 25 intrinsic value accounting method to
    the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). The following table presents the
    effects of share-based compensation included in Devon’s

    Options

Under Devon’s 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options granted may not be less than the
    estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
    In addition, options granted are exercisable during a period
    established for each grant, which may not exceed eight years
    from the date of grant. The recipient must pay the exercise
    price in cash or in common stock, or a combination thereof, at
    the time that the option is exercised. Options granted generally
    have a vesting period that ranges from three to four years.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed
    over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the fair
    values of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model, which requires Devon to make several
    assumptions. The volatility of Devon’s common stock is
    based on the historical volatility of the market price of
    Devon’s common stock over a period of time equal to the
    expected term of the option and ending on the grant date. The
    dividend yield is based on Devon’s historical and current
    yield in effect at the date of grant. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield for
    the expected term of the option at the date of grant. The
    expected term of the options is based on historical exercise and
    termination experience for various groups of employees and
    directors. Each group is determined based on the similarity of
    their historical exercise and termination behavior.

    December 31, 2007, Devon’s unrecognized compensation
    cost related to unvested stock options was $93 million.
    Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average

Restricted
    Stock Awards and Units

Under Devon’s 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, restricted
    stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions,
    restrictions

and/or

limitations, if any, that the Compensation Committee deems
    appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment.
    Generally, restricted stock awards and units vest over a minimum
    restriction period of at least three years from the date of
    grant. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted stock
    awards receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or
    other limitations. The fair value of restricted stock awards and
    units on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable
    vesting period.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2006 and 2005, Devon reduced the carrying value of
    certain of its oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities. A summary
    of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below.

    Reductions

During the second quarter of 2006, Devon drilled two
    unsuccessful exploratory wells in Brazil and determined that the
    capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired.
    Therefore, in the second quarter of 2006, Devon recognized a
    $16 million impairment of its investment in Brazil equal to
    the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share
    of block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related to this
    impairment. The two wells were unrelated to Devon’s Polvo
    development project in Brazil.

As a result of a decline in projected future net cash flows, the
    carrying value of Devon’s Russian properties exceeded the
    full cost ceiling by $10 million at the end of the third
    quarter of 2006. Therefore, Devon recognized a $20 million
    reduction of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in
    Russia, offset by a $10 million deferred income tax benefit.

    Reduction

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, Devon was capitalizing the
    costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in Brazil pending the
    determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in
    Brazil. At the end of 2005, it was expected that a small initial
    portion of the proved reserves ultimately expected at Polvo
    would be recorded in 2006. Based on preliminary estimates
    developed in the fourth quarter of 2005, the value of this
    initial partial booking of proved reserves was not sufficient to
    offset the sum of the related proportionate Polvo costs plus the
    costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts. Therefore,
    Devon determined that the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to
    the Polvo project should be impaired. These costs totaled
    approximately $42 million. There was no tax benefit related
    to this Brazilian impairment.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, deferred income taxes were reduced
    $261 million, $243 million and $14 million,
    respectively, due to successive Canadian statutory rate
    reductions that were enacted in each such year.

In 2006, deferred income taxes increased $39 million due to
    the effect of a new income-based tax enacted by the state of
    Texas that replaced a previous franchise tax. The new tax was
    effective January 1, 2007. The $39 million increase is
    included in 2006 state income taxes in the above table.

In 2005, Devon recognized $28 million of taxes related to
    its repatriation of $545 million to the United States. The
    cash was repatriated to take advantage of U.S. tax
    legislation, which allowed qualifying companies to repatriate
    cash from foreign operations at a reduced income tax rate.
    Substantially all of the cash repatriated by Devon in 2005
    related to prior earnings of its Canadian subsidiary.

Deferred
    Tax Assets and Liabilities

At December 31, 2007, Devon had the following net operating
    loss carryforwards, which are available to reduce future taxable
    income in the jurisdiction where the net operating loss was
    incurred. These carryforwards will result in a future tax
    reduction based upon the future tax rate applicable to the
    taxable income that is ultimately offset by the net operating
    loss carryforward. For financial purposes, the tax effects of
    these carryforwards, net of any valuation allowances, have been
    recognized as reductions to the net deferred tax liability at
    December 31, 2007.

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
    $812 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
    2007, net of a $50 million valuation allowance. Included in
    total deferred tax assets is $92 million related to various
    carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The
    carryforwards include state net operating loss carryforwards,
    which expire primarily between 2008 and 2026, Canadian net
    operating loss carryforwards, which expire primarily between
    2010 and 2027, and Brazilian net operating loss carryforwards,
    which have no expiration. The tax benefits of carryforwards are
    recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the
    utilization of such carryforwards to be “more likely than
    not.” When the future utilization of some portion of the
    carryforwards is determined not to be “more likely than
    not,” a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the
    recorded tax benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the state and Canadian net
    operating loss carryforwards to be utilized between 2008 and
    2012. Such expectation is based upon current estimates of
    taxable income during this period, considering limitations on
    the annual utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax
    regulations. Significant changes in such estimates caused by
    variables such as future oil and gas prices or capital
    expenditures could alter the timing of the eventual utilization
    of such carryforwards. There can be no assurance that Devon will
    generate any specific level of continuing taxable earnings.
    However, management believes that Devon’s future taxable
    income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize
    substantially all its state and Canadian tax carryforwards prior
    to their expiration.

Included in deferred tax assets for net operating loss
    carryforwards as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 is
    $64 million and $36 million, respectively, related to
    the Brazil carryforward. Although this carryforward has no
    expiration, management is uncertain whether Devon’s future
    taxable income will be sufficient to utilize a



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

substantial portion of its Brazil carryforward. This uncertainty
    is based upon annual limitations on the amount of net operating
    loss carryforwards available to reduce taxable income,
    Devon’s lack of historical taxable income in Brazil and the
    exploratory nature of several of Devon’s current projects
    in Brazil. Therefore, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    Devon had a valuation allowance of $50 million and
    $22 million, respectively, related to this carryforward.

    and penalties. Included in Devon’s unrecognized tax
    benefits of $111 million as of December 31, 2007 was
    $74 million that, if recognized, would affect Devon’s
    effective income tax rate.

    final stages of the administrative review process for certain
    open tax years. In addition, Devon is currently subject to
    various income tax audits that have not reached the
    administrative review process. As a result, Devon cannot
    reasonably anticipate the extent that the liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the
    next twelve months.

Discontinued
    Operations

Egypt
    and West Africa

In November 2006 and January 2007, Devon announced its plans to
    divest its operations in Egypt and West Africa, including
    Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon and other countries
    in the region. Pursuant to



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

accounting rules for discontinued operations, Devon has
    classified all 2007 and prior period amounts related to its
    operations in Egypt and West Africa as discontinued operations.

In October 2007, Devon completed the sale of its Egyptian
    operations and received proceeds of $341 million. As a
    result of this sale, Devon recognized a $90 million
    after-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2007. In November 2007,
    Devon announced an agreement to sell its operations in Gabon for
    $205.5 million. Devon is finalizing purchase and sales
    agreements and obtaining the necessary partner and government
    approvals for the remaining properties in the West African
    divestiture package. Devon is optimistic it can complete these
    sales during the first half of 2008.

Revenues related to Devon’s operations in Egypt and West
    Africa totaled $781 million, $929 million and
    $714 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    following table presents the main classes of assets and

Reductions
    of carrying value related to discontinued
    operations

Based on drilling activities in Nigeria, Devon reduced the
    carrying value of its Nigerian assets held for sale in 2007. As
    a result, earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 include
    a $13 million after-tax loss ($64 million pre-tax).

As a result of unsuccessful exploratory activities in Egypt
    during 2006, the net book value of Devon’s Egyptian oil and
    gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, exceeded the
    ceiling by $18 million as of the end of September 30,
    2006. Therefore, in 2006, Devon recognized an $18 million
    after-tax loss ($31 million pre-tax).

Due to unsuccessful drilling activities in Nigeria, in the first
    quarter of 2006, Devon recognized an $85 million impairment
    of its investment in Nigeria equal to the costs to drill two dry
    holes and a proportionate share of block-related costs. There
    was no income tax benefit related to this impairment.

Segment
    Information

Devon manages its business by country. As such, Devon identifies
    its segments based on geographic areas. Devon has three
    reportable segments: its operations in the U.S., its operations
    in Canada, and its international operations outside of North
    America. Substantially all of these segments’ operations
    involve oil and gas producing activities. Certain information
    regarding such activities for each segment is included in
    Note 15.

Pursuant to the full cost method of accounting, Devon
    capitalizes certain of its general and administrative expenses
    that are related to property acquisition, exploration and
    development activities. Such capitalized expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $312 million, $243 million and $158 million in
    the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Also, Devon
    capitalizes interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved
    oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and
    gas properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $65 million, $49 million and $40 million in the
    years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Results
    of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities

The following tables include revenues and expenses associated
    directly with Devon’s continuing oil and gas producing
    activities, including general and administrative expenses
    directly related to such producing activities. They do not
    include any allocation of Devon’s interest costs or general
    corporate overhead and, therefore, are not necessarily
    indicative of the contribution to net earnings of Devon’s
    oil and gas operations. Income tax expense has been calculated
    by applying statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and NGL sales
    after deducting costs, including depreciation, depletion and
    amortization and after giving effect to permanent differences.

In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Canadian income tax amounts in the
    tables above were reduced by $261 million,
    $243 million and $14 million, respectively, due to
    statutory rate reductions that were enacted in each such year.

Quantities
    of Oil and Gas Reserves

Set forth below is a summary of the reserves that were
    evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2007, 2006 and

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of revenues
    that were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

The domestic reserves were evaluated by the independent
    petroleum consultants of LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and
    Ryder Scott Company, L.P. in each of the years presented. The
    Canadian reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum
    consultants of AJM Petroleum Consultants in each of the years
    presented. The International reserves were evaluated by the
    independent petroleum consultants of Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    in each of the years presented.

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices
    (averaging $60.42 per barrel of oil, $6.01 per Mcf of gas and
    $50.57 per barrel of natural gas liquids at December 31,
    2007) to the year-end quantities of proved reserves, except
    in those instances where fixed and determinable price changes
    are provided by contractual arrangements in existence at
    year-end.



DEVON

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Future development and production costs are computed by
    estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
    producing proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year,
    based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing
    economic conditions. Of the $10.0 billion of future
    development costs as of the end of 2007, $1.9 billion,
    $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion are estimated to be
    spent in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
    also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
    Included as part of the $10.0 billion of future development
    costs are $2.1 billion of future dismantlement, abandonment
    and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
    expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
    Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
    appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
    flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
    properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
    to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
    impact of future operations.

Item 9.

Changes

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
    that material information relating to Devon, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
    certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
    senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
    principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective
    as of December 31, 2007 to ensure that the information
    required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files
    or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for Devon, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision
    and with the participation of Devon’s management, including
    our principal executive and principal financial officers, Devon
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this
    evaluation under the COSO Framework, which was completed on
    February 5, 2008, management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
    firm who audited Devon’s consolidated financial statements
    as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007, as stated
    in their report, which is included under “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2007 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.
