PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries,
(“Devon”) is an independent energy company engaged
primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and
production, the transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the
processing of natural gas. We own oil and gas properties
principally in the United States and Canada and, to a lesser
degree, various regions located outside North America, including
Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Russia and West Africa. In
addition to our oil and gas operations, we have marketing and
midstream operations. These include the marketing of natural
gas, crude oil and NGLs, and the construction and operation of
pipelines, storage and treating facilities and gas processing
plants. A detailed description of our significant properties and
associated 2005 developments can be found under
“Item 2. Properties”.

Through our predecessors, we began operations in 1971 as a
privately held company. In 1988, our common stock began trading
publicly on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol
“DVN”. In October 2004, we transferred our common
stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. Our principal and
administrative offices are located at 20 North Broadway,
Oklahoma City, OK 73102-8260 (telephone 405/235-3611).

Section 13(a) or 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically
file or furnish them to the SEC.

Strategy

We have a two-pronged operating strategy. First, we invest the
vast majority of our capital budget in low-risk exploitation and
development projects on our extensive North American property
base which provides reliable and repeatable production and
reserves additions. To supplement that strategy, we annually
invest a measured amount of capital in high-impact, long-cycle
time projects to replenish our development inventory for the
future. The philosophy that underlies the execution of this
strategy is to strive to increase value on a per share basis by:

Financial Information about Segments and Geographical
Areas

Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements
included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
our segments and geographical areas.

Development of Business

During 1988, we expanded our capital base with our first
issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a
substantial expansion program that has continued through the
subsequent years. This expansion is attributable to both a
focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of
years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling
program. Total proved reserves increased



from 8 MMBoe at year-end 1987 (without giving effect to the
1998 and 2000 mergers accounted for as poolings of interests) to
2,112 MMBoe at year-end 2005.

During the same time period, we have grown proved reserves from
0.66 Boe per diluted share at year-end 1987 (without giving
effect to the 1998 and 2000 poolings) to 4.49 Boe per diluted
share at year-end 2005. This represents a compound annual growth
rate of 12%. We also increased production from 0.09 Boe per
diluted share in 1987 (without giving effect to the 1998 and
2000 poolings) to 0.48 Boe per diluted share in 2005, a compound
annual growth rate of 10%. This per share growth is a direct
result of successful execution of our strategic plan and other
key transactions and events. A number of these recent key
transactions and events, as well as a summary of our recent
drilling activities are presented below and in the next section
of this report entitled “Drilling Activities”:

(1)

Gross wells are the sum of all wells in which we own an interest.

(2)

Net wells are gross wells multiplied by our fractional working
    interests therein.

As of December 31, 2005, we were participating in the
drilling of 149 gross (99.37 net) wells in the U.S.,
33 gross (16.55 net) wells in Canada and 35 gross
(8.58 net) wells internationally. Of these wells, through
February 1, 2006, 57 gross (34.13 net) wells in
the U.S., 11 gross (8.90 net) wells in Canada, and
2 gross (0.30 net) wells internationally had been
completed as productive. An additional 1 gross
(0.06 net) well in the U.S was a dry hole. The remaining
wells were still in progress.

Customers

We sell our gas production to a variety of customers including
pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and
local distribution companies. Existing gathering systems and
interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas
sales and deliveries.



The principal customers for our crude oil production are
refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have
pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event
pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is
trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities.

No purchaser accounted for over 10% of our revenues in 2005.

Oil and Natural Gas Marketing

The spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as
supply and demand factors fluctuate. We may periodically enter
into financial hedging arrangements, fixed-price contracts or
firm delivery commitments with a portion of our oil and gas
production. These activities are intended to support targeted
price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations.
See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.”

Oil Marketing

Our oil production is sold under both long-term (one year or
more) and short-term (less than one year) agreements at prices
negotiated with third parties.

Natural Gas Marketing

Our gas production is also sold under both long-term and
short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties.
Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2006,
approximately 79% of our natural gas production was sold under
short-term contracts at variable or market-sensitive prices.
These market-sensitive sales are referred to as “spot
market” sales. Another 19% were committed under various
long-term contracts which dedicate the natural gas to a
purchaser for an extended period of time, but still at market
sensitive prices. Our remaining gas production was sold under
long-term fixed price contracts.

Marketing and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of our marketing and midstream group is to
add value to us and other producers to whom we provide such
services by gathering, processing and marketing oil and gas
production in a timely and efficient manner. Our most
significant marketing and midstream asset is the Bridgeport
processing plant and gathering system located in North Texas.
These facilities serve not only our gas production from the
Barnett Shale but also gas production of other producers in the
area.

Our marketing and midstream revenue sources are primarily
generated by:

•

selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams
    processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for
    marketing, and

•

selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport
    pipelines and unrelated third party pipelines.

Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily
incurred from:



Competition

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

Seasonal Nature of Business

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases
during the summer months and increases during the winter months.
Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes
lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities,
local distribution companies and industrial users utilize
natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their
anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also
lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.

Government Regulation

The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of
regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil
and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review
for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation,
numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and
regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a
significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production and
marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations
increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and
gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations
are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to
predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws
and regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these
laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner
materially different than they would affect other oil and gas
companies of similar size.

The following are significant areas of government control and
regulation in the United States, Canada and international
locations in which we operate.

United States Regulation

Exploration and Production.

Our United States operations
are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state
and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for
the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order
to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans;
submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the
presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil
and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the
method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation,
storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection
with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the
restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled,
the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transportation of
production. Our operations are also subject to various
conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size
of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of
wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or
pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states
allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate
exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of
lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop
oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws
establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells,
generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose
certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of
production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the
amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to
limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.

Certain oil and gas leases, including our offshore Gulf of
Mexico leases, most of our leases in the San Juan Basin and
many of our leases in southeast New Mexico, Montana and Wyoming,
are granted by the federal government and administered by
various federal agencies, including the Minerals Management
Service of the Department of the Interior (“MMS”).
Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations
and orders which regulate, among other matters, drilling and
operations on lands covered by these leases, and calculation and
disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The
MMS has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating
and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and



regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty
payment obligations for production from federal lands. The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) also has
jurisdiction over certain offshore activities pursuant to the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Environmental and Occupational Regulations.

Various
federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the
discharge of incidental materials into the environment, the
generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants
or otherwise relating to the protection of public health,
natural resources, wildlife and the environment, affect our
exploration, development, processing, and production operations
and related costs. We are also subject to laws and regulations
concerning occupational safety and health. We consider the costs
of environmental protection and safety and health compliance
necessary and manageable parts of our business. We maintain our
own internal Environmental, Health and Safety Department. This
department is responsible for instituting and maintaining an
environmental and safety compliance program for Devon. The
program includes field inspections of properties and internal
assessments of our compliance procedures. We have been able to
plan for and comply with new environmental and safety and health
initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.

We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to
limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial
environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and
accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances.
However, 100% coverage is not maintained concerning any
environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect
to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of violation
of any federal, state or local law. We are committed to meeting
our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we
operate and anticipate making increased expenditures of both a
capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly
stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment.
Our unreimbursed expenditures in 2005 concerning such matters
were immaterial, but we cannot predict with any reasonable
degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.

We are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
environmental remediation activities associated with past
operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
state statutes. In response to claims associated with these
activities, we recognize liabilities when reasonable estimates
are possible. Such liabilities are primarily for estimated costs
associated with remediation. We have not used discounting in
determining our accrued liabilities for environmental
remediation, and no material claims for possible recovery from
third party insurers or other parties related to environmental
costs have been recognized in our consolidated financial
statements. We adjust the liabilities when new remediation
responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become
estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be
adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of our subsidiaries acquired in past mergers are
involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
by third parties. As of December 31, 2005, our consolidated
balance sheet included $4 million of non-current accrued
liabilities, reflected in “Other liabilities,” related
to these and other environmental remediation liabilities. We do
not currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of
incurring additional material costs in excess of the existing
liabilities recognized for such environmental remediation
activities. With respect to the sites in which our subsidiaries
are PRPs, our conclusion is based in large part on our
(i) participation in consent decrees with both other PRPs
and the Environmental Protection Agency, which provide for
performing the scope of work required for remediation and
contain covenants not to sue as protection to the PRPs,
(ii) participation in groups as a

de minimis PRP,

and (iii) the availability of other defenses to
liability. As a result, our monetary exposure is not expected to
be material.

Canadian Regulations

Exploration and Production.

Our Canadian operations are
subject to federal and provincial governmental regulations. Such
regulations include requiring licenses for the drilling of
wells, regulating the location of wells and the method and
ability to produce wells, surface usage and the restoration of
land



upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning
of wells and the transportation of production from wells. Our
Canadian operations are also subject to various conservation
regulations, including the regulation of the size of spacing
units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, the
unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the rate of
production allowable from oil and gas wells, and the ability to
produce oil and gas. In Canada, the effect of such regulation is
to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our
wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which
we can drill.

Royalties and Incentives.

Each province and the federal
government of Canada have legislation and regulations governing
land tenure, royalties, production rates and taxes,
environmental protection and other matters under their
respective jurisdictions. The royalty regime is a significant
factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production.
Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown
lands are determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown
royalties are determined by government regulation and are
generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross
production with the royalty rate dependent in part upon
prescribed reference prices, well productivity, geographical
location, field discovery date and the type and quality of the
petroleum product produced. From time to time, the governments
of Canada, Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan have also
established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions,
royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging
oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects.
These incentives generally have the effect of increasing our
cash flow.

Pricing and Marketing.

The price of oil, natural gas and
NGLs sold is determined by negotiation between buyers and
sellers. An order from the National Energy Board
(“NEB”) is required for oil exports from Canada. Any
oil export to be made pursuant to an export contract of longer
than one year, in the case of light crude, and two years, in the
case of heavy crude, requires an exporter to obtain an export
license from the NEB. The issue of such a license requires the
approval of the Government of Canada. Natural gas exported from
Canada is also subject to similar regulation by the NEB. Natural
gas exports for a term of less than two years, or for a term of
two to twenty years in quantities of not more than
20,000 Mcf per day, must be made pursuant to an NEB order.
Any natural gas exports to be made pursuant to a contract of
larger duration (to a maximum of 25 years) or in larger
quantities require an exporter to obtain a license from the NEB,
which requires the approval of the Government of Canada.
Exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with
purchasers, provided that the export contracts meet certain
criteria prescribed by the NEB. The governments of Alberta,
British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the volume of
natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for
consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve
availability, transportation arrangements and market
considerations.

Environmental Regulation.

The oil and natural gas
industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant to
local, provincial and federal legislation. Environmental
legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on
releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized
in association with certain oil and gas industry operations. In
addition, legislation requires that well and facility sites be
monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of
provincial authorities. A breach of such legislation may result
in the imposition of fines and penalties. We are committed to
meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever
we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures of both
a capital and expense nature as a result of the increasingly
stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment.
Our unreimbursed expenditures in 2005 concerning such matters
were immaterial, but we cannot predict with any reasonable
degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.

The North American Free Trade Agreement.

The North
American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) grants Canada
the freedom to determine whether exports to the United States or
Mexico will be allowed. In making this determination, Canada
must ensure that any export restrictions do not (i) reduce
the proportion of energy exported relative to the supply of the
energy resource; (ii) impose an export price higher than
the domestic price; or (iii) disrupt normal channels of
supply. All parties to NAFTA are also prohibited from imposing
minimum export or import price requirements.



Kyoto Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol calls for Canada to
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 6 percent below 1990
levels during the period between 2008 and 2012. The protocol is
expected to affect the operation of all industries in Canada,
including the oil and gas industry. As details of the
implementation of emissions reduction legislation related to
this protocol have yet to be finalized, the effect on our
operations cannot be determined at this time.

Investment Canada Act.

The Investment Canada Act requires
Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the
acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that
is not controlled by Canadians. In certain circumstances, the
acquisition of natural resource properties may be considered to
be a transaction requiring such approval.

International Regulations

Exploration and Production.

Our oil and gas concessions
and operating licenses or permits are granted by host
governments and administered by various foreign government
agencies. Such foreign governments require compliance with
detailed regulations and orders which regulate, among other
matters, seismic, drilling and production operations on areas
covered by concessions and permits and calculation and
disbursement of royalty payments, taxes and minimum investments
to the government.

Regulations include requiring permits for acquiring seismic
data; drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order
to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans;
submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the
presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil
and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the
method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation,
storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection
with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the
restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled,
the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of
production. Our operations are also subject to regulations which
may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can
drill.

Production Sharing Contracts.

Many of our international
licenses are governed by Production Sharing Contracts
(“PSCs”) between the concessionaires and the granting
government agency. PSCs are contracts that define and regulate
the framework for investments, revenue sharing, and taxation of
mineral interests in foreign countries. Unlike most domestic
leases, PSCs have defined production terms and time limits of
generally 30 years. Many PSCs allow for recovery of
investments including carried government percentages. PSCs
generally contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. For
example, at either higher production rates or higher cumulative
rates of return, PSCs allow governments to generally retain
higher fractions of revenue.

Environmental Regulations.

Various government laws and
regulations concerning the discharge of incidental materials
into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation
and disposal of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of
public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment,
affect our exploration, development, processing and production
operations and related costs. In general, this consists of
preparing Environmental Impact Assessments in order to receive
required environmental permits to conduct seismic acquisition,
drilling or construction activities. Such regulations also
typically include requirements to develop emergency response
plans, waste management plans, environmental protection plans
and spill contingency plans. In some countries, the application
of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000 governing
Environmental Management Systems, are required to be implemented
for international oil and gas operations. Additionally, the
Kyoto Protocol will have requirements similar to those for
Canada for the oil and gas industry in Azerbaijan, Brazil,
China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Russia. As details
of the implementation of emissions reduction initiatives related
to this protocol have yet to be announced, the effect on our
international operations, if any, cannot be determined at this
time.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, our staff consisted of
4,075 full-time employees. We believe we have good labor
relations with our employees.



Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in
general, are subject to a variety of risks. Although we have a
diversified asset base, a strong balance sheet and a history of
generating sufficient cash to fund capital expenditure and
investment programs and to pay dividends, if any of the
following risk factors should occur, our profitability,
financial condition and/or liquidity could be materially
impacted. As a result, holders of our securities could lose part
or all of their investment in Devon.

Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Prices are Volatile

Our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and
demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. A significant downward
movement of the prices for these commodities could have a
material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves,
revenues and operating cash flows. Such a downward price
movement could also have a material adverse effect on our
profitability, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties
and future growth. Historically, prices have been volatile and
are likely to continue to be volatile in the future due to
numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but
are not limited to:

Estimates of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves are
Uncertain

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir,
particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of
judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop
different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue
based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a
given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result
of several factors including additional development activity,
the viability of production under varying economic conditions
and variations in production levels and associated costs.
Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates
may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such
revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse
effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our
financial condition and profitability. Additional discussion of
our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is
described in “Item 2. Properties — Proved
Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue”.

Discoveries or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed
to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally
declines as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir
pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved
reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline
materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful
exploration and development activities or, through engineering
studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells,
secondary recovery reserves or



tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties
containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas
and NGL production and related per unit production costs are
highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or
acquiring additional reserves.

Future Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and
Involve Substantial Costs

Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire
properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are
subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not
encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The
costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In
addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling
operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in
a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular
property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful
in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an
adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling
activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves
greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently performing
exploratory drilling activities in certain international
countries. We have been granted drilling concessions in these
countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur
significant capital expenditures. Even if future drilling
activities are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves, we
will likely be required to fulfill our commitments to make such
capital expenditures.

Industry Competition For Leases, Materials, People and
Capital Can Be Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent
oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases
and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel
required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Higher
recent commodity prices have increased the costs of properties
available for acquisition, and there are a greater number of
companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition
opportunities. Certain of our competitors have financial and
other resources substantially larger than ours, and they have
also established strategic long-term positions and maintain
strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may
seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive
disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many
of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when
responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas
production, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of
production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and
the application of government regulations.

International Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic
and Other Risks

We have international operations in Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil,
China, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon,
Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria and the Russian Republic of Tatarstan.
As a result,



we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties
that are less prevalent for our operations in North America.
Such factors include, but are not limited to:

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
overall business and results of operations by distracting
management’s attention from our more significant assets.
Various regions of the world have a history of political and
economic instability. This instability could result in new
governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in
a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment.
In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of
contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This
could adversely affect our interests and our future
profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including
disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
terrorist activities.

Government Laws and Regulations Can Change

Our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in
the United States, Canada and the other international countries
in which we operate. In addition, we are also subject to the
laws and regulations of various states, provinces and local
governments. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous government
departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and
regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
for failure to comply. Changes in such legislation have
affected, and at times in the future could affect, our future
operations. Political developments can restrict production
levels, enact price controls, change environmental protection
requirements, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts
payable to governments or governmental agencies. Although we are
unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such
changes could



significantly impact our profitability. While such legislation
can change at any time in the future, those laws and regulations
outside North America to which we are subject generally include
greater risk of unforeseen change.

Environmental Matters and Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we
are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local and
international laws and regulations relating to discharge of
materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us
for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from
our operations in affected areas.

Insurance Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration, development, production and processing of oil,
natural gas and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen
occurrences such as hurricanes, blowouts, cratering, fires and
loss of well control. These occurrences can result in damage to
or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to
persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment.
We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in
accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that
management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against
all operational risks is not available to us.

Item 1B.

Unresolved
Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of our properties consist of interests in
developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage
located in our core operating areas. These interests entitle us
to drill for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from specific
areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests
and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net
profits interests, foreign government concessions and other
forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and
NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant
midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale
development in North Texas. These assets include approximately
2,600 miles of pipeline, a 650 MMcf per day gas
processing plant, and a 15,000 Bbls per day NGL
fractionator.

Proved Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
and requires significant judgment as discussed in
“Item 1A. Risk Factors”. As a result, we have
developed internal policies for estimating and recording
reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved
reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
guidance, and assign responsibilities for reserves bookings to
our Reserve Evaluation Group (the “Group”). The
policies also require that reserve estimates be made by
qualified reserves estimators (“QREs”), as defined by
the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards. A list of
QREs is kept by the Senior Advisor — Corporate
Reserves. All QREs are required to receive education covering
the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.

The Group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and
certification and includes the Manager — E&P
Budgets and Reserves and the Senior Advisor —
Corporate Reserves. The Group reports independently of any of
our operating divisions. The Vice President — Planning
and Evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing the Group
and reports to the President of Devon. No portion of the
Group’s compensation is dependent on the quantity of
reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
reserves that are audited include major fields and major changes
(additions and



revisions) to reserves. In addition, the Group reviews reserve
estimates with each of the third-party petroleum consultants as
discussed below.

In addition to internal audits, we engage three independent
petroleum consulting firms to perform both external reserves
preparation and audits. Ryder Scott Company, L.P. prepared the
reserves estimates for all offshore Gulf of Mexico properties
and for 98% of the international proved reserves. LaRoche
Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the reserves estimates for
87% of the domestic onshore properties. AJM Petroleum
Consultants prepared estimates covering 46% of our Canadian
reserves and audited an additional 26% of our Canadian reserves.

Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were
evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2005, 2004 and
2003.

“Prepared” reserves are those estimates of quantities
of reserves which were prepared by an independent petroleum
consultant. “Audited” reserves are those quantities of
reserves which were estimated by our employees and audited by an
independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
engineering and evaluation principles.

We follow what we believe to be a rational approach not only to
recording oil and gas reserves, but also to subjecting these
reserves to reviews by independent petroleum consultants. In
2004 and 2003, 63% of our company-wide reserves were prepared or
audited by an independent petroleum consulting firm. In 2005,
85% of our company-wide reserves were prepared or audited by an
independent petroleum consulting firm. We expect the
2005 percent to be indicative of the coverage provided by
independent reviews in 2006. This approach provides a high
degree of assurance about the validity of our reserve estimates.
This is evidenced by the fact that in the past five years, our
annual performance related revisions to our reserve estimates,
which have been both increases and decreases in individual
years, have averaged approximately 1% of the previous
year’s estimate.

In addition to internal and external reviews, three independent
members of our Board of Directors have been assigned to a
Reserves Committee. The Reserves Committee meets at lease twice
a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically
meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel
and our independent petroleum consultants. The Reserves
Committee assists the Board of Directors with the oversight of
the following:



The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and
the related estimated pre-tax future net revenues, pre-tax 10%
present value and after-tax standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows as of December 31, 2005. These
estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the
“Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations”
in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
included herein.

(1)

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    natural gas to oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of
    the relationship of gas to oil prices. NGL reserves are
    converted to Boe on a

one-to

-one basis with
    oil.



(2)

Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future revenue
    to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of
    estimated production and development costs and site restoration
    and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not give effect to
    non-property related expenses such as debt service and future
    income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and
    amortization.

These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect
    for each individual property as of December 31, 2005. These
    prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed
    and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions
    yield average prices over the life of our properties of
    $45.50 per Bbl of oil, $7.84 per Mcf of natural gas
    and $32.46 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to the
    December 31, 2005, NYMEX price of $61.04 per Bbl for
    crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $10.08 per MMBtu
    for natural gas.

We believe the pre-tax 10% present value is a useful measure in
    addition to standardized measure as it assists in both the
    determination of future cash flows of the current reserves as
    well as in making relative value comparisons among peer
    companies. The standardized measure is dependent on the unique
    tax situation of each individual company, while the pre-tax 10%
    present value is based on prices and discount factors which are
    consistent from company to company. We also understand that
    securities analysts use this measure in similar ways.

(3)

See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data”.

As presented in the previous table, we had 1,599 MMBoe of
proved developed reserves at December 31, 2005. Proved
developed reserves consist of proved developed producing
reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The
following table provides additional information regarding our
proved developed reserves at December 31, 2005.

No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or
included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental
authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year
except (i) in filings



with the SEC and (ii) in filings with the Department of
Energy (“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC
correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein.
Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same
underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates
of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires
reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we
operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not
operate.

The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect
market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to
December 31, 2005. There can be no assurance that all of
the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods
indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that
existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

Production, Revenue and Price History

Certain information concerning oil, natural gas and NGL
production, prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding
royalties and other third party interests) and operating
expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2005, is
set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Operation of Properties

The

day-to

-day
operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of
an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements.
The operator supervises production, maintains production
records, employs field personnel and performs other functions.

We are the operator of 18,784 of our wells. As operator, we
receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing
and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the
monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.

Organization Structure

Our North American properties are concentrated within five
geographic areas. Operations in the United States are focused in
the Permian Basin, the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and
onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions. Canadian properties are
focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and
British Columbia. Properties outside North America are located
primarily in Azerbaijan, China, Egypt and areas in West Africa,
including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Cote d’Ivoire.
Additionally, we have exploratory interests, but no current
producing assets, in other international countries including
Angola, Brazil, Ghana and Nigeria. Maintaining a tight
geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed us to
improve operating and capital efficiency.

The following table sets forth proved reserve information on the
most significant geographic areas in which our properties are
located as of December 31, 2005.

United States

Permian Basin

Our Permian Basin assets are located in portions of Southeast
New Mexico and West Texas. These assets include conventional oil
and gas properties producing from a wide variety of geologic
formations and depths. Our leasehold position in Southeast New
Mexico encompasses 108,000 net acres of developed lands and
221,000 net acres of undeveloped land and minerals.
Historically, we have been a very active operator in this area,
developing gas from the high productivity Morrow formation and
oil in the lower risk Delaware formation.

In the West Texas portion of the Permian Basin, we maintain a
base of oil production with long-life reserves. Many of these
reserves are from both operated and non-operated positions in
large enhanced oil recovery units such as the Wasson ODC Unit,
the Willard Unit, the Reeves Unit, the North Welch Unit and the
Anton Irish (Clearfork) Unit. These oil-producing units often
exhibit low decline rates. We also own a significant acreage
position in West Texas with more than 200,000 net acres of
developed lands and more than 273,000 net acres of
undeveloped land and minerals at December 31, 2005.

Mid-Continent

The Mid-Continent region includes portions of Texas, Oklahoma
and Kansas. These areas encompass a wide variety of geologic
formations and productive depths and produce both oil and
natural gas. Our Mid-Continent production has historically come
from conventional oil and gas properties. However, the Barnett
Shale in North Texas, acquired in 2002, is a non-conventional
gas resource. The Mid-Continent region represented 24% of our
proved reserves at December 31, 2005. Approximately 80% of
our proved reserves in the Mid-Continent area are in the Barnett
Shale.

The Barnett Shale, our largest producing field, is known as a
tight gas formation. This means that in its natural state, the
formation is resistant to the production of natural gas.
However, the application of available technology has made the
Barnett Shale a low-risk and highly profitable natural gas
operation. Cumulative natural gas production from our wells in
the Barnett Shale surpassed one trillion cubic feet during 2005.
We hold 552,000 net acres and over 2,100 producing wells in
the Barnett Shale. Our average working interest is more than 80%.

We have been successful in extracting gas from the Barnett Shale
by using light sand fracturing. Light sand fracturing yields
better results than earlier techniques, is less expensive and
can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing
wells to increase production rates. We are also applying
horizontal drilling, closer well spacing and reservoir
optimization techniques to further enhance the value of the
Barnett Shale.

Our marketing and midstream operations gather and process our
Barnett Shale production along with Barnett Shale production
from unrelated third parties. The Barnett Shale gathering system
consists of approximately 2,600 miles of pipeline, a
650 MMcf per day gas processing plant, and a
15,000 Bbls per day NGL fractionator.

In 2006, we plan to drill a total of 325 new Barnett Shale wells
including 266 horizontal and 59 vertical wells. We began an
infill drilling program on our core area acreage in 2005 and
plan to drill 50 to 60 horizontal infill wells in 2006. Current
net production from the Barnett Shale is approximately
95 MBoe per day.



Rocky Mountain

Our operations in the Rocky Mountain region include properties
in Wyoming, Montana, Utah, and Northern New Mexico. These assets
include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed natural
gas projects. Approximately 17% of our proved reserves in the
Rocky Mountains are from coalbed natural gas. We began producing
coalbed natural gas in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico in
the mid-1980s and began drilling coalbed natural gas wells in
the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in 1998. As of
December 31, 2005, we had approximately 1,360 producing
coalbed natural gas wells in the Powder River Basin. Net coalbed
natural gas production from the basin was approximately
11 MBoe per day as of December 31, 2005. We plan to
drill about 250 new wells in the Powder River Basin in 2006.

The Washakie field in Wyoming is another significant natural gas
producing area in our Rocky Mountain region. In 2005, we drilled
88 wells in the Washakie field, including 53 wells we
operate. In 2006, we plan to drill up to 70 wells and
participate in another 35 outside-operated wells. We have
interests in over 200,000 gross acres and an inventory of
more than 300 drilling locations. Our current net production
from Washakie is approximately 16 MBoe per day.

Gulf Coast Onshore

Our Gulf Coast onshore properties are located in South and East
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Most of the wells in the
region are completed in conventional sandstone formations.

Our operations in South Texas have focused on exploration in the
Edwards, Wilcox and Frio-Vicksburg formations. We drilled three
exploratory discoveries on our Gulf Coast acreage in 2005.
Drilling plans in 2006 include 34 new wells and 64 recompletions.

East Texas is an important conventional gas producing region,
and Carthage and Groesbeck are two of the primary producing
areas of this region. Wells produce from the Cotton Valley
sands, the Travis Peak sands and from shallower sands and
carbonates. We have interests in over 2,300 producing wells in
East Texas and plans to drill 139 wells in Carthage and
over 30 wells in Groesbeck in 2006.

We have an active exploration program under way in the Bossier
Trend in North Louisiana. We hold about 200,000 net acres
in seven Bossier prospect areas. We drilled exploratory test
wells on the Vixen and North Vixen prospects in 2005. Plans for
2006 include test wells on three additional Bossier prospects.

Gulf Offshore

The offshore Gulf of Mexico accounted for 13% of our 2005
production. We operate over 300 platforms and caissons in the
Gulf of Mexico. Gulf of Mexico operations are typically
differentiated by water depth. The shallow water shelf is
defined by water depths of 600 feet or less. We operate in
both the shelf and deepwater areas.

In 2005, we continued development of the deepwater Magnolia
field (Garden Banks 783). At December 31, 2005, six
Magnolia wells were producing approximately 10 MBoe per day
to our interest. The final two Magnolia producing wells will be
completed in 2006. Also in 2006, we will complete two producing
gas wells in the deepwater Merganser field (Atwater Valley 37).
Merganser will produce into the Independence Hub, which is
expected to be completed in early 2007. We expect our net share
of production from Merganser to be approximately eight MBoe per
day.

In addition to our producing properties, we have a significant
inventory of exploration prospects in the Gulf of Mexico. The
current prospect inventory includes 15 shelf prospects, 18
deepwater prospects in the lower Tertiary trend and 17 deepwater
Miocene prospects.

On the shallow-water shelf, the industry is exploring for oil
and gas reserves at depths in excess of 15,000 feet. We
drilled a “deep shelf” discovery well on the Big Bend
prospect (Mustang Island A-110) in 2005. We are the operator of
Big Bend with a 50% working interest.



In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, almost all historical
production of oil and gas has been from Miocene aged reservoirs.
We currently produce approximately 50 MBoe per day from the
deepwater Gulf. During 2006, we expect to drill exploratory
wells on three Miocene prospects.

In recent years, the industry has begun to explore for oil below
the Miocene in older formations that are collectively referred
to as the lower Tertiary. To date, we have participated in three
lower Tertiary discoveries.

Cascade (Walker Ridge 206) was our first discovery in the
lower Tertiary trend. We drilled successful appraisal wells on
the prospect in 2005. Also in 2005, we drilled a successful
appraisal of the Jack lower Tertiary discovery (Walker
Ridge 759). An extended production test of the Jack
appraisal well is planned for 2006. Using information obtained
from a successful production test, we and our partners will be
able to determine a development plan for the Jack discovery. We
hold 25% working interests in Jack and Cascade. Our third lower
Tertiary discovery is St. Malo (Walker Ridge 678).
Additional appraisal drilling on St. Malo is pending
partner approval and rig availability. We have a 22.5% working
interest in the St. Malo discovery.

Canada

We are among the largest independent oil and gas producers in
Canada and operate in most of the producing basins in Western
Canada. As of December 31, 2005, 30% of our proved reserves
were in Canada.

Many of the Canadian basins where we operate are accessible for
drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen.
Consequently, the winter season, from December through March, is
the most active drilling period. We expect to drill about
380 wells in the 2005-2006 winter program in Canada.

We hold approximately 410,000 net undeveloped acres in the
Deep Basin in West-Central Alberta, where we drilled
179 wells in 2005 and have another active drilling program
planned for 2006. The profitability of our operations in the
Deep Basin is enhanced by our ownership in nine gas processing
plants in the area. Deep Basin reservoirs tend to be rich in
liquids, producing up to 50 barrels of NGLs with each MMcf
of gas.

Other important oil and gas exploration and development areas in
Canada include the Peace River Arch, Northeast British Columbia,
Central Alberta and the Lloydminster region of Alberta and
Saskatchewan. At Lloydminster, cold flow heavy oil is found in
multiple horizons generally at depths of 1,000 to
2,000 feet. In 2005, we acquired 165,000 net acres in
the Iron River area within the greater Lloydminster region. We
expect to drill 800 wells at Iron River over the next four
years.

The oil sands of Eastern Alberta are a vast North American
hydrocarbon resource. We hold over 75,000 net acres of oil
sands leases in Alberta. In 2004, we received final regulatory
approval to proceed with development of our Jackfish thermal oil
sands project, in which we have a 100% working interest. The
project is expected to produce 35 MBbls per day of heavy
oil when fully operational in 2008. We expect to drill 34
horizontal wells at Jackfish in 2006 along with the construction
of the Access dual pipeline. Access will transport diluent and
blended crude oil between Jackfish and Edmonton.

International

Beyond our core properties in the United States and Canada, we
also look outside North America for longer-term reserve and
production growth. At December 31, 2005, these
international areas accounted for 12% of our worldwide proved
reserves.

The most significant international producing property is the
ExxonMobil-operated Zafiro oil field on Block B, offshore
Equatorial Guinea in West Africa. During 2005, our share of
production from Zafiro averaged 37 MBbls per day. We expect
to drill nine development wells on Block B in 2006. We drilled a
discovery on the Esmeralda prospect on Block B in 2005. We have
also identified exploratory prospects on



Block B and on three additional blocks in Equatorial Guinea.
Three exploratory wells are planned on Block P in 2006. We
drilled a discovery well on the Venus prospect on Block P in
2005.

Our second most significant international producing asset is our
Panyu project offshore China. Panyu, in the Pearl River Mouth of
the South China Sea, was discovered in 1998. Panyu production
began late in 2003. We drilled and completed five successful
development wells and tested two exploratory prospects during
2005. During 2005, our share of production from China was
15 MBbls per day.

We also have an active offshore exploration program in Brazil.
We made a discovery in 2004 offshore Brazil on Block BM-C-8.
Development of the Polvo discovery commenced in 2005 and first
production is expected in 2007. We, in partnership with
Petrobras on three blocks, were the successful bidder on three
offshore blocks in Brazil’s bid round seven in 2005. We
expect to drill five exploration wells in Brazil in 2006.

In Azerbaijan, we have a 5.6% carried working interest in the
Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli, or ACG, oil development project in the
Caspian Sea. We estimate that the ACG field contains over five
billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves. Oil production
from the ACG field began ramping up in 2005 after the Central
Azeri platform came on-line.. Based on economic factors existing
at December 31, 2005, our net share of ACG production is
expected to increase to between 30 to 35 MBbls per day in
early 2007 when payout is reached.

We also hold interests in Angola, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt,
Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Russia. Exploratory wells
in Egypt and Nigeria are planned for 2006.

Title to Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We
believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the
value of such properties or from the respective interests
therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
of the business.

As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
of local records, little investigation of record title is made
at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside
counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of
producing properties and before commencement of drilling
operations on undeveloped properties.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Royalty Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
and related parties used below-market prices, improper
deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and
sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The
principal suit in which we are a defendant is United States ex
rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. (the
“Wright case”). The suit was originally filed in
August 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000 with the
other suits for pre-trial proceedings in the United States
District Court for the District of Wyoming. On July 10,
2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to
the Eastern District of Texas to resume proceedings. Trial is
set for February 2007 if the suit continues to advance. We
believe that we have acted reasonably, have legitimate and
strong defenses to all allegations in the suit, and have paid
royalties in good faith. We do not currently believe that we are
subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit
and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith.

We have been a defendant in certain private royalty owner
litigation filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain
post production costs from royalties we pay. A significant
portion of such



production is, or will be, transported through facilities owned
by Thunder Creek Gas Services, L.L.C., of which we own a 75%
interest. During 2005, all of the litigation was resolved for
immaterial amounts.

Equatorial Guinea Investigation

The SEC has been conducting an inquiry into payments made to the
government of Equatorial Guinea, and to officials and persons
affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial
Guinea. On August 9, 2005, we received a subpoena issued by
the SEC pursuant to a formal order of investigation. We have
cooperated fully with the SEC’s previous requests for
information in this inquiry and plan to continue to work with
the SEC in connection with its formal investigation.

Other Matters

We are involved in other various routine legal proceedings
incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the
date of this report, there were no other material pending legal
proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our
property is subject.

    preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings
    before income taxes, plus fixed charges; (ii) fixed charges
    consist of interest expense, dividends on subsidiary’s
    preferred stock, distributions on preferred securities of
    subsidiary trust, amortization of costs relating to indebtedness
    and the preferred securities of subsidiary trust, and one-third
    of rental expense estimated to be attributable to interest; and
    (iii) preferred stock dividends consist of the amount of
    pre-tax earnings required to pay dividends on the outstanding

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

The following discussion and analysis presents management’s
perspective of our business, financial condition and overall
performance. This information is intended to provide investors
with an understanding of our past performance, current financial
condition and outlook for the future. Reference is made to
“Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.” The following is discussed and analyzed:

Overview of Business

Devon is the largest

U.S.-based

independent
oil and gas producer and one of the largest independent
processors of natural gas and natural gas liquids in North
America. Our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable
production and a platform for future growth. About
88 percent of our production is from North America. We also
operate in selected international areas, including Azerbaijan,
Brazil, China, Egypt, Russia and West Africa. Our production mix
is about 61 percent natural gas and 39 percent oil and
natural gas liquids such as propane, butane and ethane. We
produce 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day,
about 3 percent of all the gas consumed in North America.

In managing our global operations, we have an operating strategy
that is focused on creating and increasing value per share. Key
elements of this strategy are replacing oil and gas reserves,
growing production and exercising capital discipline. We must
also control operating costs and manage commodity pricing risks
to achieve long-term success. The discussion and analysis of our
results of operations and other related information will refer
to these factors.

•

Oil and gas reserve replacement

— Our financial
    condition and profitability are significantly affected by the
    amount of proved reserves we have. Oil and gas properties are
    our most significant asset, and the reserves that relate to such
    properties are key to our future success. As we produce these
    reserves, our estimated proved reserves decline materially.
    Therefore, we must conduct successful exploration and
    development activities or acquire additional properties
    containing proved reserves to replace reserves that have been
    produced.

•

Production growth

— Our profitability and
    operating cash flows are largely dependent on the amount of oil,
    gas and NGLs we produce. Furthermore, growing production from
    existing properties is difficult because the rate of production
    from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are
    depleted. As a result, we constantly drill for new proved
    reserves and develop proved undeveloped reserves on properties
    that provide a balance of near-term and long-term production. In
    addition, we may acquire properties with proved reserves that we
    can develop to help us meet our production goals.

•

Capital investment discipline

— Effectively
    deploying our resources into capital projects is key to helping
    us maintain and grow future production and oil and gas reserves.
    Therefore, maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in
    capital projects is important to our profitability and financial



condition. Also, our ability to control capital expenditures can
    be affected by changes in commodity prices. During times of high
    commodity prices, drilling and related costs often escalate due
    to the effects of supply versus demand economics. Approximately
    85% of our investment in capital projects is dedicated to a
    foundation of low-risk projects primarily in North America. The
    remainder of our capital is invested in high-impact projects
    primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa. By
    deploying our capital in this manner, we are able to
    consistently deliver cost-efficient drill-bit growth and provide
    a strong source of cash flow while balancing short-term and
    long-term growth targets.

•

Operating cost controls

— To maintain our
    competitive position, we must control our lease operating costs
    and other production costs. As reservoirs are depleted and
    production rates decline, per unit production costs will
    generally increase and affect our profitability and operating
    cash flows. Similar to capital expenditures, our ability to
    control operating costs can be affected when commodity prices
    rise significantly. Our base North American production is
    focused in core areas of our operations where we can achieve
    economies of scale to assist in our management of operating
    costs.

•

Commodity pricing risks

— Our profitability is
    highly dependent on the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs.
    Prices for oil, gas and NGLs are determined primarily by market
    conditions. Market conditions for these products have been, and
    will continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide
    economic activity, weather and other factors that are beyond our
    control. To manage this volatility in the past, we have utilized
    financial hedging arrangements and fixed-price contracts on a
    portion of our production and may use such instruments in the
    future.

Overview of 2005 Results and Outlook

2005 was the best year in our history. We continued to execute
our strategy to increase value per share. As a result, we
delivered record amounts for certain key measures of our
financial and operating performance in 2005:

We produced 226 million Boe in 2005, representing a 10%
decrease compared to 2004. Excluding the effects of production
lost due to the sale of non-core properties in the first half of
2005 and production suspended due to hurricanes in the last half
of 2005, our year-over-year production increased 1%. In
addition, with the significant increase in commodity prices and
the weakened U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar,
operating costs also increased. Per unit lease operating
expenses increased 17% to $5.95 per Boe.

In 2005, we utilized cash flow from operations and the proceeds
from the sale of non-core properties to fund our
$4.1 billion in capital expenditures, repay
$1.3 billion in debt and repurchase $2.3 billion of
our common stock. In August 2005, we announced a plan to
repurchase up to 50 million additional shares of our common
stock by the end of 2007. As of February 28, 2006, we had
repurchased 4.4 million shares under this program.



We have laid the foundation for continued growth in future
years, at competitive unit-costs, that we expect will create
additional value for our investors. In 2006, we expect to
deliver reserve additions of 410 to 440 million Boe
with related capital in the range of $4.6 to $4.8 billion.
We expect production to remain relatively flat from 2005 to 2006
for our retained properties. However, we expect an 8% increase
in 2007 production over 2006, reflecting the significant reserve
additions in 2004 and 2005, and those expected in 2006.

Oil Revenues

2005 vs. 2004

Oil revenues increased $276 million in
2005. Oil revenues increased $661 million due to a $10.26
increase in the average realized price of oil. A decrease in
2005 production of 14 million barrels caused oil revenues
to decrease by $385 million. Production lost from the 2005
property divestitures accounted for seven million barrels of the
decrease. We also suspended certain domestic oil production in
2005 and 2004 due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,
Dennis and Ivan. The year over year impact accounted for an
additional one million barrels of suspended production in 2005
than in 2004. The remainder of the decrease is due to certain
international properties in which our ownership interest
decreased after we recovered our costs under the applicable
production sharing contracts.



2004 vs. 2003

Oil revenues increased $614 million in
2004. An increase in 2004 production of 16 million barrels
caused oil revenues to increase by $415 million. The April
2003 Ocean merger accounted for 14 million barrels of
increased production. The remaining increase is primarily
related to new production from China partially offset by natural
production declines and the effects of Hurricane Ivan on
domestic properties in 2004. Oil revenues increased
$199 million due to a $2.55 increase in the average
realized price of oil.

Gas Revenues

2005 vs. 2004

Gas revenues increased $1.1 billion in
2005. A $1.67 per Mcf increase in the average realized gas
price caused revenues to increase by $1.4 billion. A
decrease in 2005 production of 64 Bcf caused gas revenues
to decrease by $337 million. Production associated with the
2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of 89 Bcf. We
also suspended certain domestic gas production in 2005 and 2004
due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Dennis and Ivan.
The year over year impact accounted for an additional
12 Bcf of suspended production in 2005 than in 2004. These
decreases were more than offset by new drilling and development
and increased performance in U.S. offshore and onshore
properties.

2004 vs. 2003

Gas revenues increased $835 million in
2004. An $0.81 per Mcf increase in the average realized gas
price caused revenues to increase by $714 million. An
increase in 2004 production of 28 Bcf caused gas revenues
to increase by $121 million. The April 2003 Ocean merger
accounted for 43 Bcf of increased production. This was
offset by a production decrease in domestic properties as a
result of natural declines and the effects of Hurricane Ivan in
2004.

NGL Revenues

2005 vs. 2004

NGL revenues increased $133 million in
2005. A $5.92 per barrel increase in average NGL prices
caused revenues to increase by $141 million. A slight
decrease in 2005 production due to 2005 property divestitures
and suspended production in 2005 due to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita
and Dennis caused revenues to decrease by $8 million.

2004 vs. 2003

NGL revenues increased $147 million in
2004. A $4.39 per barrel increase in average NGL prices
caused revenues to increase by $106 million. An increase in
2004 production of 2 million barrels caused revenues to
increase $41 million. The April 2003 Ocean merger accounted
for 0.6 million barrels of increased production. The
remaining production increase was primarily related to new
drilling and development in the Barnett Shale properties.

Marketing and Midstream Revenues

2005 vs. 2004

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
$91 million in 2005. Of this increase, approximately
$442 million was the result of higher overall market prices
for natural gas and NGLs. This was partially offset by
$338 million in lower revenues resulting primarily from the
sale of certain assets in 2004 and 2005. Additionally, revenues
decreased $13 million primarily due to lower third-party
natural gas and NGL throughput volumes.

2004 vs. 2003

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
$241 million in 2004. Of this increase, approximately
$218 million was the result of higher overall market prices
for natural gas and NGLs. Additionally, revenues increased
$103 million due to higher third-party natural gas and NGL
throughput volumes. This was partially offset by
$80 million in lower revenues resulting primarily from the
sale of certain assets in 2004.



Oil, Gas and NGL Production and Operating Expenses

The details of the changes in oil, gas and NGL production and
operating expenses between 2003 and 2005 are shown in the table
below.

(1)

All percentage changes included in this table are based on
    actual figures and not the rounded figures included in this
    table.

2005 vs. 2004

Lease operating expenses increased
$65 million in 2005. The increase in lease operating
expense was largely caused by higher commodity prices. With the
increase in oil, gas and NGL prices, more well workovers and
repairs and maintenance costs were performed to either maintain
or improve production volumes. Other costs, including ad valorem
taxes, power and fuel costs increased primarily as a result of
higher commodity prices. Additionally, changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate resulted in a $30 million increase in costs.
Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of
$144 million in lease operating expenses related to
properties that were sold in 2005.

The increases described above were also the primary factors
causing lease operating expenses per Boe to increase. Although
we divested properties that had higher per-unit operating costs,
the cost escalation largely related to higher commodity prices
and the weaker U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar
had a greater effect on our per unit costs than the property
divestitures.

Production taxes increased $80 million in 2005. The
majority of our production taxes are assessed on our onshore
domestic properties. In the U.S., most of the production taxes
are based on a fixed percentage of revenues. Therefore, the 18%
increase in domestic oil, gas and NGL revenues was the primary
cause of the production tax increase. In addition, production
taxes related to our international production increased
$26 million due to higher export tax rates in Russia as
well as higher oil revenues in China and Russia.

2004 vs. 2003

Lease operating expenses increased
$202 million in 2004. The April 2003 Ocean merger accounted
for $84 million of the increase. Lease operating expenses
on our historical properties increased $88 million, due to
an increase in well workover expenses, ad valorem taxes and
power, fuel, casualty insurance and repairs and maintenance
costs. Additionally, changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate resulted in a $30 million increase in costs.

The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe is primarily
related to increased well workover expenses, ad valorem taxes
and power, fuel and repairs and maintenance costs, as well as
the changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate.

Production taxes increased $51 million in 2004. The 22%
increase in domestic oil, gas and NGL revenues was the primary
cause of the production tax increase.



Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas
    Properties (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying
the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during
the year, by the “depletable base”. The depletable
base represents the net capitalized investment plus future
development costs in those reserves. Generally, if reserve
volumes are revised up or down, then the DD&A rate per unit
of production will change inversely. However, if the depletable
base changes, then the DD&A rate moves in the same
direction. The per unit DD&A rate is not affected by
production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A, as opposed to
the rate per unit of production, generally moves in the same
direction as production volumes. Oil and gas property DD&A
is calculated separately on a country-by-country basis.

2005 vs. 2004

Oil and gas property related DD&A
decreased $110 million in 2005. DD&A decreased
$210 million due to a 10% decrease in the combined oil, gas
and NGL production in 2005. This decrease was partially offset
by an increase in the consolidated DD&A rate from
$8.54 per BOE in 2004 to $8.99 per BOE in 2005 which
caused oil and gas property related DD&A to increase by
$100 million. In 2005, finding and development costs for
reserve discoveries and extensions were lower than previous
years but were higher than the 2004 DD&A rate of $8.54 which
caused the 2005 rate to increase $0.49. With the higher
commodity prices, current development costs and estimates of
future development costs increased in 2005 compared to 2004. In
addition, changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate caused the rate to increase $0.17. These increases
were partially offset by a $0.21 decrease in the rate as a
result of our 2005 property divestitures.

2004 vs. 2003

Oil and gas property related DD&A
increased $473 million in 2004. An increase in the
consolidated DD&A rate from $7.33 per BOE in 2003 to
$8.54 per BOE in 2004 caused oil and gas property related
DD&A to increase by $305 million. The increase in the
DD&A rate is primarily related to the April 2003 Ocean
merger, negative reserve revisions in Canada and certain
international countries subject to production sharing contracts
and changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate. A 10% increase in 2004 oil, gas and NGL
production caused DD&A to increase $168 million.

Marketing and Midstream Operating Costs and
    Expenses

2005 vs. 2004

Marketing and midstream operating costs and
expenses increased $3 million in 2005. Of this increase,
approximately $306 million was the result of an increase in
prices paid for natural gas and NGLs. This was partially offset
by $297 million in lower costs and expenses resulting
primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004 and 2005.
Additionally, operating costs and expenses decreased
$6 million primarily due to lower third-party natural gas
and NGL throughput volumes.

2004 vs. 2003

Marketing and midstream operating costs and
expenses increased $165 million in 2004. Of this increase,
approximately $133 million was the result of an increase in
prices paid for natural gas and NGLs. Additionally, operating
costs and expenses increased $106 million due to higher
third-party natural gas and NGL throughput volumes. This was
partially offset by $74 million in lower costs and expenses
resulting primarily from the sale of certain assets in 2004.

General and Administrative Expenses
    (“G&A”)

Our net G&A consists of three primary components. The
largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses
incurred for personnel costs, office expenses, professional fees
and other G&A items. The gross amount of these expenses is
partially reduced by two offsetting components. One is the
amount of G&A capitalized pursuant to the full cost method
of accounting related to exploration and development activities.
The other is the amount of G&A reimbursed by working
interest owners of properties for which we serve as the
operator. These reimbursements are received during both the
drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. The
gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts capitalized
and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the consolidated
statements of operations. Net G&A includes



expenses related to oil, gas and NGL exploration and production
activities, as well as marketing and midstream activities. See
the following table for a summary of G&A expenses by
component.

2005 vs. 2004

Gross G&A increased $35 million.
Higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross
G&A to increase $38 million. Of this increase,
$17 million related to higher restricted stock compensation
primarily due to our December 2005 and 2004 grants. In addition,
changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate caused a $9 million increase in costs. These
increases were offset by an $8 million decrease in rent
expense resulting primarily from the abandonment of certain
Canadian office space in 2004.

The $17 million increase in capitalized G&A resulted
primarily from the higher salaries and benefits related to oil
and gas exploration and development capital projects. In
addition, changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate caused capitalized G&A to increase
$3 million.

2004 vs. 2003

Gross G&A increased $25 million.
The April 2003 Ocean merger increased gross expenses
$27 million primarily due to the inclusion of an additional
four months of Ocean activities in 2004 compared to 2003. Also,
higher compensation and benefit costs, increased charitable
contributions and the abandonment of certain Canadian office
space increased gross G&A $26 million, $12 million
and $5 million, respectively. During 2004, we also incurred
$6 million of incremental professional fees related to
additional activities performed to comply with the requirements
of Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Finally,
changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate resulted in a $8 million increase in costs.
These increases were partially offset by the synergies obtained
from the Ocean merger.

The increase in both capitalized G&A of $32 million and
reimbursed G&A of $23 million was primarily related to
the increased activity subsequent to the April 2003 Ocean merger.



Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas
    Properties

During 2005 and 2003, we reduced the carrying value of our oil
and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations and
unsuccessful exploratory activities. A detailed description of
how full cost ceiling limitations are determined is included in
the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this
report. A summary of these reductions and additional discussion
is provided below.

2005 Reductions

Our interests in Angola were acquired through the Ocean Energy
acquisition. Our drilling program has been unsuccessful in
Angola, resulting in no proven reserves for the country. After
drilling three unsuccessful wells in the fourth quarter of 2005,
we determined that all of the Angolan capitalized costs should
be impaired. Devon has a commitment to drill one additional well
in Angola by the end of August 2006.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we were capitalizing the
costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in Brazil pending the
determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in
Brazil. We have been successful in our drilling efforts on block
BM-C-8 in Brazil, and are currently developing our Polvo project
on this block. The ultimate value of the Polvo project is
expected to be in excess of the sum of its related costs, plus
the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts in
Brazil which were capitalized. However, the Polvo proved
reserves will be recorded over a period of time. It is expected
that a small initial portion of the proved reserves ultimately
expected at Polvo will be recorded in 2006. Based on preliminary
estimates developed in the fourth quarter of 2005, the value of
this initial partial booking of proved reserves will not be
sufficient to offset the sum of the related proportionate Polvo
costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful
efforts. Therefore, we determined that the prior unsuccessful
costs unrelated to the Polvo project should be impaired. These
costs totaled approximately $42 million. There is no tax
benefit related to the Brazilian impairment.

2003 Reductions

The Egyptian reduction was primarily due to poor results of a
development well that was unsuccessful in the primary objective.
Partially as a result of this well, we revised Egyptian proved
reserves downward. The Russian reduction was primarily the
result of additional capital costs incurred as well as an
increase in operating costs. The Indonesian reduction was
primarily related to an increase in operating costs and a
reduction in proved reserves.

Additionally, during 2003, we elected to discontinue certain
exploratory activities in Ghana, certain properties in Brazil
and other smaller concessions. After meeting the drilling and
capital commitments on



these properties, we determined that these properties did not
meet our internal criteria to justify further investment.
Accordingly, we recorded a charge associated with the impairment
of these properties.

Interest Expense

The following schedule includes the components of interest
expense between 2003 and 2005.

2005 vs. 2004

The average debt balance decreased from
$8.2 billion in 2004 to $7.4 billion in 2005 due to
debt repayments during 2004 and 2005. This decrease in debt
outstanding caused interest expense to decrease
$53 million. This decrease in interest expense was
partially offset by a $47 million increase due to higher
floating rates in 2005. The average interest rate on outstanding
debt increased from 6.3% in 2004 to 6.8% in 2005.

Other items included in interest expense that are not related to
the debt balance outstanding were $64 million higher in
2005. Of this increase, $51 million related to the early
retirement premium for the redemption of the $400 million
6.75% notes and $25 million related to the loss on the
early redemption of the zero coupon convertible senior
debentures. In conjunction with the early redemption of the
senior debentures, we also expensed $5 million in remaining
unamortized issuance costs. This was partially offset by
$16 million of unamortized debt issuance costs that were
expensed in the second quarter of 2004 upon the early repayment
of the outstanding balance under our $3 billion term loan
credit facility.

2004 vs. 2003

The average debt balance outstanding
decreased from $8.6 billion in 2003 to $8.2 billion in
2004 causing interest expense to decrease $22 million. The
decrease in average debt outstanding was due to debt repayments
during 2004. The average interest rate on outstanding debt
increased from 6.2% in 2003 to 6.3% in 2004. The higher rate in
2004 caused interest expense to increase $4 million.

Other items included in interest expense that are not related to
the debt balance outstanding were $9 million lower in 2004.
Of this decrease, $20 million related to the capitalization
of interest. The increase in interest capitalized was primarily
related to additional unproved properties acquired from the
April 2003 Ocean Energy merger and the nature of the properties
acquired. The Ocean properties included significant deepwater
Gulf and international exploratory properties and major
development projects. The effect of the $20 million
increase in capitalized interest was partially offset by the
$16 million of debt issuance costs that were expensed in
2004 as a result of the early repayment of the outstanding
balance under our $3 billion term loan credit facility.

Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates

Our Canadian subsidiary, which has designated the Canadian
dollar as its functional currency, had $400 million
6.75% senior notes outstanding which were denominated in
U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar while the notes were
outstanding increased or decreased the expected amount of
Canadian dollars eventually required to repay the notes. In
addition, our Canadian subsidiary has cash and other working
capital amounts denominated in U.S. dollars which



also fluctuate in value with changes in the exchange rate. Such
changes in the Canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt
and working capital balances are required to be included in
determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange
rate changes.

The changes in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate from $0.8308 at December 31, 2004 to $0.8503
at the redemption date of the Canadian senior notes resulted in
a gain of $9 million in 2005. Also in 2005, our Canadian
subsidiary purchased U.S. dollars related to our
repatriation of $535 million of earnings from our Canadian
operations to the U.S. As a result of a decrease in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate while these U.S. dollars were held, we
recognized a $7 million loss in 2005. The increase in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate from $0.7738 at December 31, 2003 to $0.8308
at December 31, 2004 resulted in a $22 million gain.
The increase in the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate from $0.6331 at December 31, 2002 to $0.7738
at December 31, 2003 resulted in a $69 million gain.

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Financial

The change in fair value of the option embedded in debentures
exchangeable into shares of Chevron Corporation common stock
decreased $4 million and increased $61 million in 2005
and 2004, respectively. The value of this option is driven
primarily by the price of Chevron Corporation’s common
stock. Generally, as the price of Chevron Corporation’s
common stock increases, we recognize a larger loss on the option.

In 2005, we recognized a $39 million loss on certain oil
derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified for
hedge accounting because the hedged production exceeded actual
and projected production under these contracts. The lower than
expected production was caused primarily by hurricanes that
affected offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.

2005 vs. 2004

Other income increased $93 million in
2005. Other income increased $117 million due to gains
resulting from sales of certain non-oil and gas properties in
2005. Interest and dividend income increased $50 million in
2005 primarily due to an increase in cash and short-term
investment balances and higher interest rates. The 2005 loss on
derivative financial instruments resulted primarily from a



$55 million loss on certain commodity hedges that no longer
qualified for hedge accounting and were settled prior to the end
of their original term. These hedges related to U.S. and
Canadian oil production from properties sold as part of our 2005
property divestiture program. This loss was partially offset by
a $7 million gain related to interest rate swaps that were
settled prior to the end of their original term in conjunction
with the early redemption of the $400 million
6.75% senior notes in 2005.

2004 vs. 2003

Other income increased $66 million in
2004. Other income increased $36 million due to gains
resulting from sales of certain non-oil and gas properties in
2004. Interest and dividend income increased $12 million in
2004 due to an increase in cash and short-term investment
balances.

Income Taxes

2005 vs. 2004

Our 2005 effective financial tax rate was
36% compared to 34% in 2004. Both rates approximated the 35%
statutory federal tax rate. Income taxes were reduced by
$14 million and $36 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, related to Canadian statutory rate reductions. The
2005 rate also included $28 million of additional tax
related to our repatriation of $545 million, substantially
all of which was Canadian earnings from our Canadian subsidiary,
to the U.S.

2004 vs. 2003

Our 2004 effective financial tax rate
attributable to continuing operations was 34% compared to 23% in
2003. Both years’ rates were affected by the incremental
effect of state income taxes offset by the tax benefits of
certain foreign deductions. In addition, both the 2004 and 2003
rates included benefits from Canadian statutory rate reductions
of $36 million and $218 million, respectively.
Excluding the effect of the 2003 Canadian rate reduction, the
2003 effective tax rate would have been 33%.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,

and recorded
a cumulative-effect-type adjustment for an increase to net
earnings of $16 million net of deferred taxes of
$10 million.

In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 106 (“SAB No. 106”)
to provide guidance regarding the interaction of
SFAS No. 143 with the full cost method of accounting
for oil and gas properties. Specifically, SAB No. 106
clarifies the manner in which the full cost ceiling test and
DD&A should be calculated in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 143. We adopted SAB No. 106 in
the fourth quarter of 2004. However, this adoption did not
materially impact our full cost ceiling test calculation or
DD&A for 2004.

Capital Resources, Uses and Liquidity

The following discussion of capital resources and liquidity
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data”.



Sources and Uses of Cash

At December 31, 2005, our unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments totaled
$2.3 billion. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, such balances
increased $167 million, $846 million and
$981 million, respectively. The following table summarizes
the changes in our cash and cash equivalents from 2003 to 2005.
Additional discussion of the key elements contributing to these
changes follows the table.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
flow”) is our primary source of capital and liquidity.
Operating cash flow is largely affected by our net earnings,
excluding large non-cash expenses such as depreciation,
depletion and amortization and deferred income tax expense. As a
result, our operating cash flow increased in 2005 and 2004
compared to the previous years due to increases in net earnings,
as discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of
this report.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Capital Expenditures.

The increases in operating cash
flow enabled us to invest larger amounts in capital projects. As
a result, our capital expenditures increased 32% to
$4.1 billion in 2005. The majority of this increase related
to our expenditures for the acquisition, drilling or development
of oil and gas properties, which totaled $3.9 billion in
2005. Increased drilling activities in the Barnett Shale, the
approximately $200 million acquisition of Iron River
acreage in Canada and the $74 million purchase of the
Serpentina FPSO in offshore Equatorial Guinea were large
contributors to the increase. Significant cost escalation and
the weaker U.S. dollar also caused our expenditures to
increase from 2004 to 2005.

Capital expenditures also increased 20% to $3.1 billion in
2004. Our April 2003 merger with Ocean Energy was the primary
cause of this increase because 2003 only included eight months
of capital activity related to the Ocean Energy properties
acquired.

Proceeds from Sales of Property and Equipment.

In 2005,
we generated $2.2 billion in proceeds from sales. This
consisted primarily of $2.0 billion in pre-tax proceeds,
net of all purchase price adjustments, related to the sale of
non-core oil and gas properties. In addition, we sold non-core
midstream assets for $0.2 billion in pre-tax proceeds. Net
of related income taxes, these proceeds were $1.8 billion
for oil and gas properties and $0.1 billion for midstream
assets.

Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were
$95 million and $179 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These amounts consisted primarily of proceeds
related to the sale of non-core midstream assets.

Changes in Short-Term Investments.

To maximize our income
on available cash balances, we invest in highly liquid,
short-term investments. The purchase and sale of these
short-term investments will cause



cash and cash equivalents to decrease and increase,
respectively. Short-term investment balances decreased
$287 million in 2005, increased $626 million in 2004
and increased $341 million in 2003.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net Debt Repayments.

Our net debt retirements were
$1.3 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 amount includes
$0.8 billion related to the retirement of the zero coupon
convertible debentures and the $400 million
6.75% notes due March 2011 before their scheduled maturity
dates. The 2004 amount includes $635 million for the
payment of the outstanding balance under our $3 billion
term loan credit facility. The 2003 amount includes payments on
certain debt instruments assumed in the April 2003 Ocean Energy
merger.

Stock Repurchases.

We are utilizing operating cash flow
and proceeds from the sale of non-core oil and gas properties to
repurchase our common stock. In August 2005, we completed the
stock repurchase program announced September 27, 2004.
Under this program, we repurchased 44.6 million shares at a
total cost of $2.1 billion in 2005, and 5.0 million
shares at a total cost of $189 million in 2004. Subsequent
to the completion of the program announced in 2004, we announced
on August 3, 2005 a new program. Under this new program, we
may repurchase up to 50 million shares by the end of 2007.
In 2005, we purchased 2.2 million shares at a total cost of
$134 million under this new repurchase program.

Dividends.

Our common stock dividends were
$136 million, $97 million and $39 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We also paid $10 million
of preferred stock dividends in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The 2005
increase in common stock dividends was primarily related to a
50% increase in the dividend rate in the first quarter of 2005,
partially offset by a decrease in outstanding shares due to
share repurchases. The 2004 increase in common stock dividends
resulted from a 100% increase in the dividend rate in the first
quarter of 2004 and an increase in outstanding shares due to the
April 2003 Ocean Energy merger.

Issuance of Common Stock.

Proceeds from the issuance of
our common stock were $124 million, $268 million and
$155 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These
proceeds were derived primarily from the exercise of employee
stock options.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has
been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain a revolving
line of credit and a commercial paper program which can be
accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other
available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance
of equity securities and long-term debt. We expect the
combination of these sources of capital will be more than
adequate to fund future capital expenditures, common stock
repurchases, and other contractual commitments as discussed
later in this section.

Operating Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow has increased nearly 50% since 2003,
reaching a total of $5.6 billion in 2005. Our operating
cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of
which is pricing of the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced.
Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by
prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic
activity, weather and other substantially variable factors
influence market conditions for these products. These factors
are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We expect
operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of
liquidity.

Credit Lines

Another source of liquidity is our $1.5 billion five-year,
syndicated, unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Senior
Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes
(i) a five-year revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum
amount of U.S. $500 million and (ii) a
$1 billion sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit,
including letters of credit under the Canadian subfacility.
Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at our
election, bear interest at various fixed rate options for
periods of up to



twelve months. Such rates are generally less than the prime
rate. However, we may elect to borrow at the prime rate. As of
December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility. The available capacity under the Senior
Credit Facility as of December 31, 2005, net of
$310 million of outstanding letters of credit, was
approximately $1.2 billion.

The Senior Credit Facility matures on April 8, 2010, and
all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time
unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 8
anniversary date, we have the option to extend the maturity of
the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
of the lenders. We are working to obtain lender approval to
extend the current maturity date of April 8, 2010 to
April 8, 2011. If successful, this maturity date extension
will be effective April 7, 2006, provided we have not
experienced a “material adverse effect,” as defined in
the Senior Credit Facility agreement, at that date.

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial
covenant. This covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt
to total capitalization to be less than 65%. The credit
agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total
capitalization that include adjustments to the respective
amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. As
defined in the agreement, total funded debt excludes the
debentures that are exchangeable into shares of Chevron
Corporation common stock. Also, total capitalization is adjusted
to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost
ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of
December 31, 2005, our ratio as calculated pursuant to this
covenant was 27.0%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility is not
restricted under any “material adverse effect”
clauses. It is not uncommon for credit agreements to include
such clauses. These clauses can remove the obligation of the
banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on
the borrower’s financial condition, operations, properties
or business considered as a whole, the borrower’s ability
to make timely debt payments, or the enforceability of material
terms of the credit agreement. While our Senior Credit Facility
includes covenants that require us to report a condition or
event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the
banks to fund the Senior Credit Facility is not conditioned on
the absence of a material adverse effect.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
program may not exceed $725 million. Also, any borrowings
under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
under the Senior Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven
and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
365 days. We had no commercial paper debt outstanding at
December 31, 2005.

Debt Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the
United States. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies
consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
agencies. Our current debt ratings are BBB with a positive
outlook by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 with a stable
outlook by Moody’s and BBB with a stable outlook by Fitch.

There are no “rating triggers” in any of our
contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled
maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level.
Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility is
predicated on our corporate debt rating. Therefore, even though
a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities,
it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings
under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Senior
Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the
fully-drawn borrowing costs for the Senior Credit Facility from
LIBOR plus 70 basis points to a new rate of LIBOR plus
87.5 basis points. A ratings downgrade could also adversely
impact our ability to economically access future debt markets.
As of December 31, 2005, we were not aware of any potential
ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.



Capital Expenditures

In February 2006, we announced our 2006 capital expenditures
budget. Our 2006 capital expenditures are expected to range from
$5.0 billion to $5.2 billion. This represents the
largest planned use of our 2006 operating cash flow, and is 20%
to 30% higher than the 2005 capital expenditures. To a certain
degree, the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is
within our control. Therefore, if oil and natural gas prices
fluctuate from current estimates, we could choose to defer a
portion of these planned 2006 capital expenditures until later
periods or accelerate capital expenditures planned for periods
beyond 2006 to achieve the desired balance between sources and
uses of liquidity. Based upon current oil and natural gas price
expectations for 2006, we anticipate that our capital resources
will be more than adequate to fund 2006 capital expenditures.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

During 2006 and 2007, we may repurchase up to 47.8 million
additional shares in conjunction with our stock repurchase
program announced in August 2005. We anticipate the shares would
be repurchased with operating cash flow. The stock repurchase
program may be discontinued at any time.

Contractual Obligations

A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31,
2005, is provided in the following table.



agreements to aid the movement of our gas production to market.
    We expect to have sufficient production to utilize the majority
    of these transportation services.

(6)

Lease obligations consist of operating leases for office and
    equipment, an offshore platform spar and an FPSO. Office and
    equipment leases represent non-cancelable leases for office
    space and equipment used in our daily operations.

We have an offshore platform spar that is being used in the
    development of the Nansen field in the Gulf of Mexico. This spar
    is subject to a

20-year

lease and contains various options whereby we may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spars. We have guaranteed that
    the spar will have a residual value at the end of the term equal
    to at least 10% of the fair value of the spar at the inception
    of the lease. The total guaranteed value is $14 million in
    2022. However, such amount may be reduced under the terms of the
    lease agreements. In 2005, we sold our interests in the Boomvang
    field in the Gulf of Mexico, which has a spar lease with terms
    similar to those of the Nansen lease. As a result of the sale,
    we are subleasing the Boomvang Spar. The table above does not
    include any amounts related to the Boomvang spar lease. However,
    if the sublessee defaults on its obligation, we would be
    required to continue making the lease payments and any
    guaranteed payment required at the end of the term.

We have an FPSO that is being used in the Panyu project offshore
    China. This FPSO lease term expires in September 2009.

Pension Funding and Estimates

Funded Status.

As compared to the “projected benefit
obligation,” our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit
plans were underfunded by $133 million and
$132 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. A detailed reconciliation of the 2005 changes to
our underfunded status is included in Note 11 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. Of the
$133 million underfunded status at the end of 2005,
$126 million is attributable to various nonqualified
defined benefit plans which have no plan assets. However, we
have established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations
of such nonqualified plans. As of December 31, 2005, these
trusts had investments with a fair value of $59 million.
The value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets
in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation,”
our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by
$37 million at December 31, 2005. The accumulated
benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation
in that the former includes no assumption about future
compensation levels. Our current intentions are to provide
sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated
benefit obligation remains fully funded. The actual amount of
contributions required during this period will depend on
investment returns from the plan assets. Required contributions
also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during
the same period, particularly the discount rate used to
calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit
obligation. For 2006, we expect our contributions to the plan to
be less than $10 million.

Pension Estimate Assumptions.

Our pension expense is
recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate
service periods and is generally calculated independent of
funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our
defined benefit pension plans of $26 million,
$26 million and $35 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. We estimate that our pension expense will
approximate $31 million in 2006.

The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
assumptions can result in different expense and liability
amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the
assumptions. We believe that the two most critical assumptions
affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount
rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
weighted average rate of return of 8.40% and 8.34% at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We developed
these expected long-term rate of return assumptions by
evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
well as long-term



inflation assumptions. The expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types
in such assets. The target investment allocation for our plan
assets is 50% U.S. large cap equity securities; 15%
U.S. small cap equity securities, equally allocated between
growth and value; 15% international equity securities, equally
allocated between growth and value; and 20% debt securities. We
expect our long-term asset allocation on average to approximate
the targeted allocation. We regularly review our actual asset
allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the
targeted allocation when considered appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
assumption of 100 basis points (from 8.40% to 7.40%) would
increase the expected 2006 pension expense by $5 million.

We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted
average rate of 5.72% at December 31, 2005, compared to
5.74% at December 31, 2004. The discount rate is determined
at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations
could be effectively settled. This rate is based on high-quality
bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk. We
consider high quality corporate bond yield indices, such as
Moody’s Aa, when selecting the discount rate.

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
25 basis points (from 5.72% to 5.47%) would increase our
pension liability at December 31, 2005, by
$23 million, and increase estimated 2006 pension expense by
$3 million.

At December 31, 2005, we had unrecognized actuarial losses
of $195 million which will be recognized as a component of
pension expense in future years. These losses are primarily due
to reductions in the discount rate since 2001. We estimate that
approximately $12 million and $11 million of the
unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension
expense in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The $12 million
estimated to be recognized in 2006 is a component of the total
estimated 2006 pension expense of $31 million referred to
earlier in this section.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
various other factors related to the participants in our defined
benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and
liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors
will be in the future.

On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) announced that it expects to make
significant changes in the disclosure and measurement rules for
pension benefits. These expected changes will be made in two
stages. The first stage of rule changes are expected to be
issued in 2006. These rule changes are expected to require
companies to recognize a pension asset or liability equal to the
difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair
value of the plan assets. As a result, unrecognized actuarial
losses and other unrecognized costs that are used to calculate
the pension asset or liability under current rules will be
recognized immediately as an adjustment to stockholders’
equity. Had these rule changes been effective December 31,
2005, our stockholders’ equity would have decreased less
than 1%. The second stage of this project is expected to take
several years before rule changes are presented.

Contingencies and Legal Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters,
see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and note 12
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
recorded when known.



The critical accounting policies used by management in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those
that are important both to the presentation of our financial
condition and results of operations and require significant
judgments by management with regard to estimates used. Our
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and
estimates related to those policies are described below. We have
reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Full Cost Ceiling Calculations

Policy Description

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
subject to amortization. If our net book value of oil and gas
properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of
the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an
expense, except as discussed in the following paragraph. The
ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in
which we have oil and gas properties.

If, subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the
applicable financial statements being published, prices increase
to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be
recovered, a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the
quarter is not required to be recorded. A writedown indicated at
the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of
additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the
quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements
would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered,
as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter.
An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a
subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have
increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Judgments and Assumptions

The discounted present value of future net revenues for our
proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is a major component of
the ceiling calculation, and represents the component that
requires the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves
are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates
of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process
of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves requires
substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations,
particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers
may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the
same data. Certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or
audited by outside petroleum consultants, while other reserve
estimates are prepared by our engineers. See Note 15 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior
estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
years, annual revisions to our reserve estimates, which have
been both increases and decreases in individual years, have
averaged approximately 1% of the previous year’s estimate.
However, there can be no assurance that more significant
revisions will not be necessary in the future. If future
significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously
estimated reserve quantities, it could result in a full cost
property writedown. In addition to the impact of the estimates
of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling, estimates
of proved reserves are also a significant component of the
calculation of DD&A.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
judgment, the associated prices of oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves, and the applicable discount rate, that are used to
calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not
require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10%
discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as
of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely.
Therefore, the future net revenues associated with the estimated
proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices
or costs. Rather, they are based on such prices and costs in
effect as of



the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is
performed. In calculating the ceiling, we adjust the

end-of

-period price by
the effect of cash flow hedges in place. This adjustment
requires little judgment as the

end-of

-period price is
adjusted using the contract prices for our cash flow hedges. We
had no such hedges outstanding at December 31, 2005.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect
as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
indefinitely, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting
value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.
Oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. On
any particular day at the end of a quarter, prices can be either
substantially higher or lower than our long-term price forecast
that is a barometer for true fair value. Therefore, oil and gas
property writedowns that result from applying the full cost
ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price
as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a
reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Policy Description

Historically, we have used oil and gas derivative financial
instruments to manage our exposure to oil and gas price
volatility. We have also used interest rate swaps to manage our
exposures to interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps
mitigate either the effects on interest expense for
variable-rate debt instruments, or the debt fair values for
fixed-rate debt. We are not involved in any speculative trading
activities of derivatives. All derivatives requiring balance
sheet recognition are recognized on the balance sheet at their
fair value. At December 31, 2005, the only derivative
financial instruments outstanding consisted of interest rate
swaps.

Prior to December 31, 2005, a substantial portion of our
derivatives consisted of contracts that hedged the price of
future oil and natural gas production. At inception, these
derivative contracts were cash flow hedges that qualified for
hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, while fair values of such
hedging instruments are estimated as of the end of each
reporting period, the changes in the fair values attributable to
the effective portion of these hedging instruments are not
included in our consolidated results of operations. Instead, the
changes in fair value of the effective portion of these hedging
instruments, net of tax, are recorded directly to
stockholders’ equity until the hedged oil or natural gas
quantities are produced. The ineffective portion of these
hedging instruments is included in our consolidated results of
operations.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we designate our cash
flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative
contract is entered into or the date of a business combination
which includes cash flow hedge instruments. Additionally, we
document all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We also
assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of hedged items. If we fail to meet the requirements for
using hedge accounting treatment, changes in fair value of these
hedging instruments would not be recorded directly to equity but
in the consolidated results of operations.

Judgments and Assumptions

The estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative
contracts require substantial judgment. For these contracts, we
obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil and
gas trading points in North America from independent third
parties. These forward prices are compared to the price
parameters contained in the hedge agreements. The resulting
estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the
hedge contracts are discounted using LIBOR and money market
futures rates for the first year and money market futures and
swap rates thereafter. In addition, we estimate the option value
of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model.
These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the
period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes
in forward prices, regional price differentials



and interest rates. Fair values of our other derivative
contracts require less judgment to estimate and are primarily
based on quotes from independent third parties such as
counterparties or brokers.

Quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal
impact on our liquidity, capital resources or results of
operations, as long as the derivative contracts qualify for
treatment as a hedge. However, settlements of derivative
contracts do have an impact on our liquidity and results of
operations. Generally, if actual market prices are higher than
the price of the derivative contracts, our net earnings and cash
flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that
would have occurred absent these instruments. The opposite is
also true. Additional information regarding the effects that
changes in market prices will have on our derivative financial
instruments, net earnings and cash flow from operations is
included in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk”.

Business Combinations

Policy Description

We have grown substantially during recent years through
acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies. Most of
these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting, and recent accounting pronouncements
require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using
the purchase method.

Under the purchase method, the acquiring company adds to its
balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired
company’s assets and liabilities. Any excess of the
purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and
intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
is assessed for impairment at least annually.

Judgments and Assumptions

There are various assumptions we make in determining the fair
values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities. The
most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most
judgment, involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas
properties acquired. To determine the fair values of these
properties, we prepare estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves. These estimates are based on work performed by our
engineers and that of outside consultants. The judgments
associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier
in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling
calculation.

However, there are factors involved in estimating the fair
values of acquired oil, natural gas and NGL properties that
require more judgment than that involved in the full cost
ceiling calculation. As stated above, the full cost ceiling
calculation applies

end-of

-period price and
cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling
amount. By contrast, the fair value of reserves acquired in a
business combination must be based on our estimates of future
oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Our estimates of future prices
are based on our own analysis of pricing trends. These estimates
are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and
worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth
forecasts. They are also based on industry data regarding
natural gas storage availability, drilling rig activity, changes
in delivery capacity, trends in regional pricing differentials
and other fundamental analysis. Forecasts of future prices from
independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing
estimates.

We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve
quantities acquired, and estimate future operating and
development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net
revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues
are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the
time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital.

We also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair
value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination.
These unproved properties generally represent the value of
probable and possible reserves. Because of their very nature,
probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than
those of proved reserves. To compensate for the inherent risk of
estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future
net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by
what we



consider to be an appropriate risk-weighting factor in each
particular instance. It is common for the discounted future net
revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by
factors ranging from 30% to 80% to arrive at what we consider to
be the appropriate fair values.

Generally, in our business combinations, the determination of
the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more
judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities.
The acquired companies commonly have long-term debt that we
assume in the acquisition, and this debt must be recorded at the
estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt. However,
significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in
these situations due to the existence of comparable market
values of debt issued by peer companies.

Except for the 2002 Mitchell merger, our mergers and
acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were
predominantly in the area of exploration, development and
production activities related to oil and gas properties.
However, in addition to exploration, development and production
activities, Mitchell’s business also included substantial
marketing and midstream activities. Therefore, a portion of the
Mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of
Mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and
equipment. This consisted primarily of natural gas processing
plants and natural gas pipeline systems.

The Mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing
properties that we also acquired from Mitchell. Therefore,
certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the
gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the
midstream assets. For example, future quantities of natural gas
estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were
based on the same estimates used to value the proved and
unproved gas producing properties. Future expected prices for
marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price
cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas
producing assets acquired from Mitchell. Based on historical
costs and known trends and commitments, we also estimated future
operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream
assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows. These cash
flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to
discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets
to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and
midstream facilities and equipment.

In addition to the valuation methods described above, we perform
other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in
any business combination. These analyses include information
related to comparable companies, comparable transactions and
premiums paid.

In a comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
independent exploration and production companies with comparable
financial and operating characteristics. Such characteristics
are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to
those of the party to the proposed business combination. We
compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed
business combination company multiples for reasonableness.

In a comparable transactions analysis, we review certain
acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and
production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages
announced recently. We compare these comparable transaction
multiples to the proposed business combination transaction
multiples for reasonableness.

In a premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected
independent exploration and production company transactions in
addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded
companies announced recently, to review the premiums paid to the
price of the target one day, one week and one month prior to the
announcement of the transaction. We use this information to
determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to
the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness.

While these estimates of fair value for the various assets
acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity
or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future
results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value
assigned to both the oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas
properties, the lower future net earnings will be as a result of
higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas
properties, based on higher



future estimates of oil and gas prices, will increase the
likelihood of a full cost ceiling writedown in the event that
subsequent oil and gas prices drop below our price forecast that
was used to originally determine fair value. A full cost ceiling
writedown would have no effect on our liquidity or capital
resources in that period because it is a noncash charge, but it
would adversely affect results of operations. As discussed in
the Capital Resources, Uses and Liquidity section of this
report, in calculating our

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio under our credit agreement, total capitalization is
adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full
cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments.

Our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many
estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair
value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business
combination. As previously disclosed in our discussion of the
full cost ceiling calculations, during the past five years, our
annual revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged
approximately 1%. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity
estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil
and gas properties acquired in a business combination. The
inter-relationship of these estimates makes it impractical to
provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of
changes in these estimates.

Valuation of Goodwill

Policy Description

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. This
requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and
liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above
for a business combination. Therefore, considerable judgment
similar to that described above in connection with estimating
the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination
is also required to assess goodwill for impairment.

Judgments and Assumptions

Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil
and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower
goodwill would be. A lower goodwill value decreases the
likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes
in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the
likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill
impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital
resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of
operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”,
(“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which is a revision of
SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25
regarding stock-based employee compensation plans. APB Opinion
No. 25 requires recognition of compensation expense only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
stock option exercise price on the date of grant. Additionally,
SFAS No. 123 established fair value-based accounting
for stock-based employee compensation plans but allowed pro
forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement
recognition. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to
be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Also, pro forma
disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based
payments is no longer an alternative. We will adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of
2006 using the modified prospective method. Under this method,
we will recognize compensation expense for all stock-based
awards granted or modified on or after January 1, 2006, as
well as any previously granted awards that are not fully vested
as of January 1, 2006. Compensation expense will be
measured based on the fair value of the awards previously
calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. Based on our
current estimates of the amount of 2006 stock option grants and
the various assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these



stock option grants, we expect stock option expense, net of
related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method
of accounting for oil and gas properties, will be approximately
$35 million. No retroactive or cumulative effect
adjustments will be recorded upon adoption.

2006 Estimates

The forward-looking statements provided in this discussion are
based on our examination of historical operating trends, the
information which was used to prepare the December 31, 2005
reserve reports and other data in our possession or available
from third parties. These forward-looking statements were
prepared assuming demand, curtailment, producibility and general
market conditions for our oil, natural gas and NGLs during 2006
will be substantially similar to those of 2005, unless otherwise
noted. We make reference to the “Disclosure Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this
report. Amounts related to Canadian operations have been
converted to U.S. dollars using a projected
average 2006 exchange rate of $0.87 U.S. dollar to
$1.00 Canadian dollar.

Oil, Gas and NGL Production and Prices

Set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates
of oil, gas and NGL production for 2006. On a combined basis, we
estimate our 2006 oil, gas and NGL production will total
approximately 217 MMBoe. Of this total, approximately 95%
is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as
“proved” at December 31, 2005.

Oil Production

Oil production in 2006 is expected to total approximately
58 MMBbls. Of this total, approximately 99% is estimated to
be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at
December 31, 2005. The expected production by area is as
follows:

Oil Prices

We have not fixed the price we will receive on any of our 2006
oil production. Our 2006 average prices for each of our areas
are expected to differ from the NYMEX price as set forth in the
following table. The NYMEX price is the monthly average of
settled prices on each trading day for benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma.

fixed, our 2006 average prices for each of our areas are
expected to differ from the NYMEX price as set forth in the
following table. The NYMEX price is determined to be the

first-of

-month South
Louisiana Henry Hub price index as published monthly in

Inside FERC.

Canada

80% to  90%

International

NGL Production

We expect our 2006 production of NGLs to total approximately
22 MMBbls. Of this total, 97% is estimated to be produced
from reserves classified as “proved” at
December 31, 2005. The expected production by area is as
follows:

Marketing and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived
primarily from our natural gas processing plants and natural gas
transport pipelines. These revenues and expenses vary in
response to several factors. The factors include, but are not
limited to, changes in production from wells connected to the
pipelines and related processing plants, changes in the absolute
and relative prices of natural gas and



NGLs, provisions of the contract agreements and the amount of
repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated
processing levels.

These factors, coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas
and NGL prices, increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
these uncertainties, we estimate that 2006 marketing and
midstream revenues will be between $1.74 billion and
$2.20 billion, and marketing and midstream expenses will be
between $1.38 billion and $1.80 billion.

Production and Operating Expenses

Our production and operating expenses include lease operating
expenses, transportation costs and production taxes. These
expenses vary in response to several factors. Among the most
significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from
the property base, changes in the general price level of
services and materials that are used in the operation of the
properties, the amount of repair and workover activity required
and changes in production tax rates. Oil, natural gas and NGL
prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and
impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that 2006 lease operating
expenses (including transportation costs) will be between
$1.43 billion and $1.50 billion and production taxes
will be between 3.25% and 3.75% of consolidated oil, natural gas
and NGL revenues.

DD&A

The 2006 oil and gas property DD&A rate will depend on
various factors. Most notable among such factors are the amount
of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or
acquisition efforts in 2006 compared to the costs incurred for
such efforts, and the revisions to our year-end 2005 reserve
estimates that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made
during 2006.

Given these uncertainties, we expect oil and gas property
related DD&A rate will be between $9.30 per Boe and
$9.50 per Boe. Based on these DD&A rates and the
production estimates set forth earlier, oil and gas property
related DD&A expense for 2006 is expected to be between
$2.02 billion and $2.06 billion.

Additionally, we expect depreciation and amortization expense
related to non-oil and gas property fixed assets to total
between $170 million and $180 million.

Accretion of Asset Retirement Obligation

The 2006 accretion of asset retirement obligation is expected to
be between $48 million and $53 million.

G&A

Our G&A includes employee compensation and benefits costs
and the costs of many different goods and services used in
support of our business. G&A varies with the level of our
operating activities and the related staffing and professional
services requirements. In addition, employee compensation and
benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect
the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to
employees. Also, goods and services are subject to general price
level increases or decreases. Therefore, significant variances
in any of these factors from current expectations could cause
actual G&A to vary materially from the estimate.

Given these limitations, consolidated G&A in 2006 is
expected to be between $360 million and $380 million.
This estimate includes $35 million of expenses related to
restricted stock compensation costs, net of related
capitalization in accordance with the full cost method of
accounting for oil and gas properties. This estimate also
includes $35 million of expenses related to stock option
compensation costs, net of related capitalization.



Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas
    Properties

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
properties described in “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates”. Reductions to the carrying value of our oil and
gas properties are largely dependent on the success of drilling
results and oil and natural gas prices at the end of our
quarterly reporting periods. Due to the uncertain nature of
future drilling efforts and oil and natural gas prices, we are
not able to predict whether we will incur such reductions in
2006.

Interest Expense

Future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant
effect on our interest expense. We can only marginally influence
the prices we will receive in 2006 from sales of oil, natural
gas and NGLs and the resulting cash flow. These factors increase
the margin of error inherent in estimating future interest
expense. Other factors which affect interest expense, such as
the amount and timing of capital expenditures, are within our
control.

Based on the information related to interest expense set forth
below and assuming no material changes in our expected level of
indebtedness or prevailing interest rates, we expect our 2006
interest expense (net of amounts capitalized) will be between
$385 million and $395 million. Details of this
estimate are discussed in the following paragraphs.

The interest expense in 2006 related to our fixed-rate debt,
including net accretion of related discounts, will be
approximately $410 million. This fixed-rate debt removes
the uncertainty of future interest rates from some, but not all,
of our long-term debt. Our floating rate debt is discussed in
the following paragraphs.

We have various debt instruments which have been converted to
floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps. Our
floating rate debt is as follows:

Converted from $200 million Canadian dollars at a

    exchange rate of $0.8577 at December 31, 2005.

Based on future LIBOR rates as of January 31, 2006,
interest expense on our floating rate debt, including net
amortization of premiums, is expected to total between
$35 million and $45 million in 2006.

Our interest expense totals include payments of facility and
agency fees, amortization of debt issuance costs, the effect of
interest rate swaps not accounted for as hedges, and other
miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances
outstanding. We expect between $5 million and
$15 million of such items to be included in 2006 interest
expense. Also, we expect to capitalize between $65 million
and $75 million of interest during 2006.

Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Rates

Foreign currency gains or losses are not expected to be material
in 2006.

Other Revenues

Our other revenues in 2006 are expected to be between
$155 million and $175 million.

We maintain a comprehensive insurance program that includes
coverage for physical damage to our offshore facilities caused
by hurricanes. Our insurance program also includes substantial
business



interruption coverage which we expect to utilize to recover
costs associated with the suspended production related to
hurricanes that struck the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter
of 2005. Under the terms of the insurance program, we are
entitled to be reimbursed for the portion of production
suspended longer than forty-five days, subject to upper limits
to oil and natural gas prices. Also, the terms of the insurance
include a standard, per-event deductible of $1 million for
offshore losses as well as a $15 million aggregate annual
deductible. Based on current estimates of physical damage and
the anticipated length of time we will have production
suspended, we expect our policy settlements will exceed repair
costs and deductible amounts. As a result, 2006 and 2007 other
revenues are expected to include more than $150 million for
anticipated insurance proceeds in excess of repair costs. This
estimate is dependent upon several variables, including the
actual amount of time that production is suspended, the actual
prices in effect while production is suspended and the timing of
collections of insurance proceeds. Based on current estimates of
the timing of collections of insurance proceeds, we expect 2006
other revenues will include $50 million to $70 million
for anticipated insurance proceeds, with the balance to be
recorded in 2007. Significant variances in any of these factors
from current estimates could cause actual 2006 other revenues to
vary materially from the estimate.

Income Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2006 will vary materially
depending on the actual amount of financial pre-tax earnings.
The tax rate for 2006 will be significantly affected by the
proportional share of consolidated pre-tax earnings generated by
U.S., Canadian and International operations due to the different
tax rates of each country. There are certain tax deductions and
credits that will have a fixed impact on 2006 income tax expense
regardless of the level of pre-tax earnings that are produced.

Given the uncertainty of pre-tax earnings, we expect our
consolidated financial income tax rate in 2006 will be between
25% and 45%. The current income tax rate is expected to be
between 20% and 30%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to
be between 5% and 15%. Significant changes in estimated capital
expenditures, production levels of oil, gas and NGLs, the prices
of such products, marketing and midstream revenues, or any of
the various expense items could materially alter the effect of
the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on the 2006
financial income tax rates.

Year 2006 Potential Capital Sources, Uses and
    Liquidity

Capital Expenditures

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions in
recent years, these transactions are opportunity driven. Thus,
we do not budget, nor can we reasonably predict, the timing or
size of such possible acquisitions, if any.

Our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of
future oil, natural gas and NGL prices as well as the
expected costs of the capital additions. Should actual prices
received differ materially from our price expectations for
future production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred
and, consequently, may increase or decrease total 2006 capital
expenditures. In addition, if the actual material or labor costs
of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated
amounts, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from
our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed above, the following table shows
expected drilling, development and facilities expenditures by
geographic area. Production capital related to proved reserves
relates to reserves classified as proved as of year-end 2005.
Other production capital includes development drilling that does
not offset currently productive units and for which there is not
a certainty of continued production from a



known productive formation. Exploration capital includes
exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in
previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs.

In addition to the above expenditures for drilling, development
and facilities, we expect to spend between $255 million to
$275 million on marketing and midstream assets, which
include our oil pipelines, gas processing plants,
CO


removal facilities and gas transport pipelines. We also expect
to capitalize between $230 million and $240 million of
G&A expenses in accordance with the full cost method of
accounting and to capitalize between $65 million and
$75 million of interest. We also expect to pay between
$35 million and $45 million for plugging and
abandonment charges and to spend between $130 million and
$140 million for other non-oil and gas property fixed
assets.

Other Cash Uses

We expect to continue the policy of paying a quarterly common
stock dividend. With the current $0.1125 per share
quarterly dividend rate and 443 million shares of common
stock outstanding as of December 31, 2005, dividends are
expected to approximate $200 million. Also, we have
$150 million of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock upon which
we will pay $10 million of dividends in 2006.

On August 3, 2005, we announced our intention to repurchase
up to 50 million shares of our common stock. This stock
repurchase program is planned to extend through 2007. During
this period, shares may be purchased from time to time depending
upon market conditions. We plan to repurchase shares in the open
market and in privately negotiated transactions. As of
February 28, 2006, we had repurchased 4.4 million
shares under the program for $267 million.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our estimated 2006 cash uses, including drilling and development
activities and repurchase of common stock, are expected to be
funded primarily through a combination of working capital (which
totaled $1.3 billion at the end of 2005) and operating cash
flow. The remainder, if any, could be funded with borrowings
from our credit facility. We expect our combined capital
resources to be more than adequate to fund anticipated capital
expenditures and other cash uses for 2006 without the use of the
available credit facility.

If significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital
requirements arise during the year, we could utilize our
existing credit facilities and/or seek to establish and utilize
other sources of financing.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market
risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse
changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. The disclosures are not meant to be
precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
instruments were entered into for purposes other than
speculative trading.



Commodity Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian natural gas
and NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production
has been volatile and unpredictable for several years. See
“Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

Currently, we are largely accepting the volatility risk that oil
and natural gas prices present. None of our future oil and
natural gas production is subject to price swaps or collars. In
addition, none of our estimated 2006 oil production, and only 2%
of our estimated 2006 natural gas production, is subject to
fixed-price physical delivery contracts as summarized in the
table below.

In addition, we have fixed-price physical delivery contracts for
the years 2007 through 2011 covering Canadian natural gas
production ranging from seven Bcf to 14 Bcf per year. We
also have fixed-price physical delivery contracts covering
International gas production of four Bcf per year in 2007 and
three Bcf in 2008.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2005, we had debt outstanding of
$6.6 billion. Of this amount, $5.5 billion, or
84%, bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.4%.

The remaining $1.1 billion of debt outstanding bears
interest at floating rates. Included in the floating-rate debt
is fixed-rate debt which has been converted to floating-rate
debt through interest rate swaps. Following is a table
summarizing the

fixed-to

-floating
interest rate swaps with the related debt instrument and
notional amounts.

Converted from $200 million Canadian dollars at a

-U.S. dollar
    exchange rate of $0.8577 at December 31, 2005.

We use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the
hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on
the fair value of our interest rate swap instruments. At
December 31, 2005, a 10% increase in the underlying
interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our
interest rate swaps by $8 million.

The above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
because of the short-term maturity of such instruments.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of
such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional
currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries
are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable
exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues,
expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange
rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in
the

Canadian-to

-U.S. dollar
exchange rate would not materially impact our December 31,
2005 balance sheet.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years
in the

three-year

period ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, as of January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

Asset Retirement Obligations

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Devon Energy Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The more significant of such policies
are briefly discussed below.

Nature of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration,
development and production, and the acquisition of properties.
Such activities domestically are concentrated in four geographic
areas:

Devon’s Canadian activities are located primarily in the
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Devon’s international
activities — outside of North America — are
located primarily in Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Russia
and areas in West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and
Cote d’Ivoire.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations which are
responsible for marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and
constructing and operating pipelines, storage and treating
facilities and gas processing plants. These services are
performed for Devon as well as for unrelated third parties.

The accounts of Devon’s wholly owned subsidiaries are
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates
and assumptions include estimates of proved reserves and related
present value estimates of future net revenue, the carrying
value of oil and gas properties, goodwill impairment assessment,
asset retirement obligations, income taxes, valuation of
derivative instruments, obligations related to employee benefits
and legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Property and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
incurred that are directly identified with acquisition,
exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for
its own account, and which are not related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities, are also
capitalized. Interest costs incurred and attributable to
unproved oil and gas properties under current evaluation and
major development projects of oil and gas properties are also
capitalized.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unproved properties are excluded from amortized capitalized
costs until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can
be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved
properties for impairment quarterly. Significant unproved
properties are assessed individually. Costs of insignificant
unproved properties are transferred to amortizable costs over
average holding periods ranging from three years for
onshore properties to seven years for offshore properties.

Net capitalized costs are limited to the estimated future net
revenues, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil,
natural gas and NGL reserves plus the cost of properties not
subject to amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude
future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement
obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas
properties. Such limitations are imposed separately on a
country-by-country basis and are tested quarterly. Capitalized
costs are depleted by an equivalent

unit-of

-production
method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic
feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is
calculated using the capitalized costs, including estimated
asset retirement costs, plus the estimated future expenditures
(based on current costs) to be incurred in developing proved
reserves, net of estimated salvage values. No gain or loss is
recognized upon disposal of oil and gas properties unless such
disposal significantly alters the relationship between
capitalized costs and proved reserves in a particular country.
All costs related to production activities, including workover
costs incurred solely to maintain or increase levels of
production from an existing completion interval, are charged to
expense as incurred.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a

units-of

-production
basis. Depreciation and amortization of other property and
equipment, including corporate and other midstream assets and
leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line
method based on estimated useful lives from three to
39 years.

Effective January 1, 2003, Devon adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(“SFAS No. 143”) using a cumulative
effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset
retirement obligations, asset retirement costs and accumulated
depreciation. SFAS No. 143 requires liability
recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets, such as producing well sites, offshore
production platforms, and natural gas processing plants. The
obligations included within the scope of SFAS No. 143
are those for which a company faces a legal obligation. The
initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to
record a separate liability at its fair value with an offsetting
asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the related
property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. The
asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and
rational method similar to that used for the associated property
and equipment.

Devon had previously estimated costs of dismantlement, removal,
site reclamation, and other similar activities in the total
costs that were subject to depreciation, depletion, and
amortization. However, Devon did not record a separate asset or
liability for such amounts. Upon adoption, Devon recorded a
cumulative-effect-type adjustment for an increase to net
earnings of $16 million net of deferred taxes of
$10 million. Additionally, Devon established an asset
retirement obligation of $453 million, an increase to
property and equipment of $400 million and a decrease in
accumulated DD&A of $79 million.

In September 2004, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 106 (“SAB No. 106”)
to provide guidance regarding the interaction of
SFAS No. 143 with the full cost method of accounting
for oil and gas properties. Specifically, SAB No. 106
clarifies the manner in which the full cost ceiling test and
depletion of oil and gas properties should be calculated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 143. Devon
adopted SAB No. 106 prospectively in the fourth
quarter of 2004. However, this adoption has not materially
impacted the full cost ceiling test calculation or depletion
since adoption.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Short-Term Investments and Other Marketable
    Securities

Devon reports its short-term investments and other marketable
securities at fair value, except for debt securities in which
management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, Devon’s short-term
investments consisted of $680 million and
$967 million, respectively, of auction rate securities
classified as available for sale. Although Devon’s auction
rate securities have contractual maturities of more than
10 years, the underlying interest rates on such securities
reset at intervals ranging from seven to 90 days.
Therefore, these auction rate securities are priced and
subsequently trade as short-term investments because of the
interest rate reset feature. As a result, Devon has classified
its auction rate securities as short-term investments in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Devon’s only other significant investment security is its
investment in approximately 14.2 million shares of Chevron
Corporation (“Chevron”) common stock which is reported
at fair value. Except for unrealized losses that are determined
to be “other than temporary”, the tax effected
unrealized gain or loss on the investment in Chevron common
stock is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and
reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
fourth quarters of 2005, 2004 and 2003. Based on these
assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004:

Revenue Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold
to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery
has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectibility of
the revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is
transferred when production has been delivered to a pipeline or
truck or a tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating
to future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
recognition criteria are met.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
properties. These



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

differences create imbalances that are recognized as a liability
only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be
sufficient to enable the under produced owner to recoup its
entitled share through production. If an imbalance exists at the
time the wells’ reserves are depleted, settlements are made
among the joint interest owners under a variety of arrangements.
The liability is priced based on current market prices. No
receivables are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken
less than its share of production unless all revenue recognition
criteria are met.

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
fixed or determinable price, when delivery or performance has
occurred and title has transferred, and if collectibility of the
revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to
Devon’s gas and NGL purchase and processing contracts are
reported on a gross basis since Devon takes title to the
products and has risks and rewards of ownership. The gas
purchased under these contracts is processed in Devon-owned
plants.

Major Purchasers

No purchaser accounted for over 10% of revenues in 2005, 2004
and 2003.

Derivative Instruments

Historically, Devon has entered into oil and gas financial
instruments to manage its exposure to oil and gas price
volatility. Devon has also entered into interest rate swaps to
manage its exposure to interest rate volatility. The interest
rate swaps mitigate either the effects of interest rate
fluctuations on interest expense for variable-rate debt
instruments, or the debt fair values for fixed-rate debt. At
December 31, 2005, the only derivative financial
instruments outstanding consisted of interest rate swaps.

All derivatives are recognized as fair value of financial
instruments on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair
value. Prior to December 31, 2005, a substantial portion of
Devon’s derivatives consisted of contracts that hedged the
price of future oil and natural gas production. At inception,
these derivative contracts were cash flow hedges that qualified
for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, while fair values of
such hedging instruments must be estimated as of the end of each
reporting period, the changes in the fair values attributable to
the effective portion of these hedging instruments are not
included in Devon’s consolidated results of operations.
Instead, the changes in fair value of the effective portion of
these hedging instruments, net of tax, are recorded directly to
accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
stockholders’ equity, until the hedged oil or natural gas
quantities are produced. The ineffective portion of these
hedging instruments is included in consolidated results of
operations as change in fair value of derivative financial
instruments.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, Devon designates its
cash flow hedge instruments as such on the date the derivative
contract is entered into or the date of a business combination
which includes cash flow hedge instruments. Additionally, Devon
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Devon also
assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of hedged items. If Devon fails to meet the requirements
for using hedge accounting, changes in fair value of these
hedging instruments would not be recorded directly to equity but
in the consolidated results of operations. During 2004 and 2003,
no derivatives ceased to qualify for hedge accounting.

In the third quarter of 2005, certain oil derivatives ceased to
qualify for hedge accounting primarily as a result of deferred
production caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Because
these contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting, Devon
recognized $39 million in losses as change in fair value of
derivative financial instruments in the accompanying statement
of operations.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In the first half of 2005, Devon recognized a $55 million
loss related to certain oil hedges that no longer qualified for
hedge accounting due to the property divestiture program. These
commodity instruments related to 5,000 barrels per day of
U.S. oil production and 3,000 barrels per day of
Canadian oil production from properties that were sold as part
of Devon’s divestiture program. This loss is presented in
other income in the statement on operations.

By using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in
commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes itself to
credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the
counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative
contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are
placed with counterparties that Devon believes are minimal
credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative
contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed
by management to be competent and competitive market makers.

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative
instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or
interest rates. The market risk associated with commodity price
and interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and
monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market
risk that may be undertaken. The oil and gas reference prices
upon which the commodity hedging instruments are based reflect
various market indices that have a high degree of historical
correlation with actual prices received by Devon. Devon does not
hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading
purposes.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Devon recorded in its statements of
operations losses of $94 million and $62 million and a
gain of $1 million, respectively, for the change in the
fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, as well as the ineffectiveness of
derivatives that do qualify as hedges.

Common Stock

On September 27, 2004, Devon declared a two-for-one stock
split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, to stockholders
of record on October 29, 2004. Common stock shares and per
share amounts prior to 2004 have been restated to reflect this
two-for-one stock split.

Stock Options

Devon applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and related
interpretations, in accounting for its fixed plan stock options.
As such, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant
only if the current market price of the underlying stock
exceeded the exercise price. SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

(“SFAS No. 123”) established accounting
and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As
allowed by SFAS No. 123, Devon has elected to continue
to apply the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
described above, and has adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 123.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Had Devon elected the fair value provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and recognized compensation expense over
the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock options
granted as of their grant date, Devon’s 2005, 2004 and 2003
pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share
would have differed from the amounts actually reported as shown
in the following table.

The weighted average fair values of stock options granted during
2005, 2004 and 2003 were $19.65, $10.32 and $8.14, respectively.
The fair value of each option grant was estimated for disclosure
purposes on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model with the following assumptions for 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 4.4%, 3.2% and
2.8%; dividend yields of 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.4%; expected lives of
four, four and four years; and volatility of the price of the
underlying common stock of 31.0%, 32.2% and 37.9%.

Income Taxes

Devon accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well
as the future tax consequences attributable to the future
utilization of existing tax net operating loss and other types
of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences and
carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. At December 31, 2005, undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries were determined to be
permanently reinvested. Therefore, no U.S. deferred income
taxes were provided on such amounts at December 31, 2005.

In October 2004, Congress enacted new tax legislation allowing
qualifying corporations to repatriate cash from foreign
operations at a reduced income tax rate. In 2005, Devon
repatriated $545 million, substantially all of which was
from Canadian operations and was taxed at the reduced income tax
rate. As a result, Devon recognized approximately
$28 million of additional current income tax expense. In
addition, this tax legislation creates a new U.S. tax
deduction which will be phased in starting in 2005 for companies
with domestic production activities, including oil and gas
extraction.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Net Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
Devon’s dilutive outstanding stock options were exercised
(calculated using the treasury stock method), if the previously
outstanding preferred stock of a subsidiary were converted to
common stock and if Devon’s previously outstanding zero
coupon convertible senior debentures were converted to common
stock.

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments

Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries use the Canadian dollar as
their functional currency. Therefore, the assets and liabilities
of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars based on the current exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet dates, while income and expenses are
translated at average rates for the periods presented.
Translation adjustments have no effect on net income and are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. Devon’s International
subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency.

Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Devon
considers all highly liquid investments with original
contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

Commitments and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
be reasonably estimated.

Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Liabilities for these expenditures are
recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Reference is made
to note 12 for a discussion of amounts recorded for these
liabilities.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
    Adopted

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”,
(“SFAS No. 123(R)”) which is a revision of
SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25
regarding stock-based employee compensation plans. APB Opinion
No. 25 requires recognition of compensation expense only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
stock option exercise price on the date of grant. Additionally,
SFAS No. 123 established fair value-based accounting
for stock-based employee compensation plans but allowed pro
forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement
recognition. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to
be



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expensed over the applicable vesting period. Also, pro forma
disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based
payments is no longer an alternative. Devon will adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of
2006 using the modified prospective method. Under this method,
Devon will recognize compensation expense for all stock-based
awards granted or modified on or after January 1, 2006, as
well as any previously granted awards that are not fully vested
as of January 1, 2006. Compensation expense will be
measured based on the fair value of the awards previously
calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. Based on our
current estimates of the amount of 2006 stock option grants and
the various assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these
stock option grants, we expect stock option expense, net of
related capitalization in accordance with the full cost method
of accounting for oil and gas properties, will be approximately
$35 million. No retroactive or cumulative effect
adjustments will be recorded upon adoption.

Business Combinations and Pro Forma Information

Ocean Energy, Inc.

On April 25, 2003, Devon completed its merger with Ocean
Energy, Inc. (“Ocean”). In the transaction, Devon
issued 0.828 shares of its common stock for each
outstanding share of Ocean common stock (or a total of
approximately 148 million shares). Also, Devon assumed
approximately $1.8 billion of debt (current and long-term)
from Ocean.

Devon acquired Ocean primarily for the significant production,
development projects and exploration prospects in both the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and internationally, and the additional
producing assets onshore in the United States and in the
shallower shelf regions of the Gulf of Mexico.

In September 2004, Devon announced its plans to divest certain
non-core oil and gas properties in the offshore Gulf of Mexico
and onshore in the United States and Canada. During 2005, Devon
closed all such property divestitures and received
$2.0 billion of gross proceeds, net of all purchase price

Under full cost accounting rules, a gain or loss on the sale or
other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized
unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of
oil and gas attributable to a cost center. Because the
divestitures that closed in 2005 did not significantly alter
such relationship, Devon did not recognize a gain or loss on
these divestitures. Therefore, the proceeds from these
transactions were recognized as an adjustment of capitalized
costs in the respective cost centers.

As described in Note 1, effective January 1, 2003,
Devon adopted SFAS No. 143 and began recording asset
retirement obligations for estimated property and equipment
dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs when a legal
obligation is incurred. In accordance with

Credit Facilities with Banks

Devon has a $1.5 billion five-year, syndicated, unsecured
revolving line of credit (the “Senior Credit
Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes (i) a
five-year revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
U.S. $500 million and (ii) a $1 billion
sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit, including
letters of credit under the Canadian subfacility.

The Senior Credit Facility matures on April 8, 2010, and
all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time
unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 8
anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of
the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
of the lenders. Devon is working to obtain lender approval to
extend the current maturity date of April 8, 2010 to
April 8, 2011. If successful, this maturity date extension
will be effective on April 7, 2006, provided Devon has not
experienced a “material adverse effect,” as defined in
the Senior Credit Facility agreement, at that date.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the
election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options
for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally
less than the prime rate. Devon may also elect to borrow at the
prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides for an
annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable
quarterly in arrears.

The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility contains
certain covenants and restrictions, including a maximum allowed

debt-to

-capitalization
ratio of 65% as defined in the agreement. At December 31,
2005, Devon was in compliance with such covenants and
restrictions. Devon’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2005, as calculated pursuant to the
terms of the agreement, was 27.0%.

As of December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility. The available capacity under the Senior
Credit Facility as of December 31, 2005, net of
$310 million of outstanding letters of credit, was
approximately $1.2 billion.

Commercial Paper

Devon also has a commercial paper program under which it may
borrow up to $725 million. Borrowings under the commercial
paper program reduce available capacity under the Senior Credit
Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The commercial paper
borrowings may have terms of up to 365 days and bear
interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The
interest rate is based on a standard index such as the Federal
Funds Rate, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the money
market rate as found on the commercial paper market. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, Devon had no commercial paper
debt outstanding.

Exchangeable Debentures

The exchangeable debentures consist of $444 million of
4.90% debentures and $316 million of
4.95% debentures. The exchangeable debentures were issued
on August 3, 1998 and mature August 15, 2008. The
exchangeable debentures were callable beginning August 15,
2000, initially at 104.0% of principal and at prices declining
to 100.5% of principal on or after August 15, 2007. At
December 31, 2005, the call price was 101.5% of principal.
The exchangeable debentures are exchangeable at the option of
the holders at any time prior to maturity, unless previously
redeemed, for shares of Chevron common stock. In lieu of
delivering Chevron common stock to an exchanging debenture
holder, Devon may, at its option, pay to such holder an amount
of cash equal to the market value of the Chevron common stock.
At maturity, holders who have not exercised their exchange
rights will receive an amount in cash equal to the principal
amount of the debentures.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2005, Devon beneficially owned
approximately 14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock.
These shares have been deposited with an exchange agent for
possible exchange for the exchangeable debentures. Each $1,000
principal amount of the exchangeable debentures is exchangeable
into 18.6566 shares of Chevron common stock, an exchange
rate equivalent to $53.60 per share of Chevron stock.

The exchangeable debentures were assumed as part of the
PennzEnergy merger. The fair values of the exchangeable
debentures were determined as of August 17, 1999, based on
market quotations. In accordance with derivative accounting
standards, the total fair value of the debentures has been
allocated between the interest-bearing debt and the option to
exchange Chevron common stock that is embedded in the
debentures. Accordingly, a discount was recorded on the
debentures and is being accreted using the effective interest
method which raised the effective interest rate on the
debentures to 7.76%.

Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures

In June 2005, Devon redeemed the zero coupon convertible
debentures prior to their scheduled maturity of June 27,
2020. Devon’s obligation to settle the conversions and
redeem the debentures totaled $452 million and was
satisfied with cash on hand. The total cash payments to settle
the conversions and redeem the debentures exceeded the accreted
value of the debentures by $25 million. This
$25 million, as well as $5 million of unamortized
issuance costs, are included in interest expense in the
accompanying 2005 statements of operations. The after-tax
effect of these expenses was $19 million.

2.75% Notes due August 1, 2006

On August 4, 2003, Devon issued these notes which are
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon. The proceeds
from the issuance of these debt securities, net of discounts and
issuance costs, of $498 million were used to repay amounts
outstanding under Devon’s $3 billion term loan credit
facility.

10.125% Debentures due November 15, 2009

These debentures were assumed as part of the PennzEnergy
acquisition. The fair value of the debentures was determined
using August 17, 1999, market interest rates. As a result,
premiums were recorded on these debentures which lowered their
effective interest rate to 8.9%. The premium is being amortized
using the effective interest method.

6.875% Notes due September 30, 2011 and
    7.875% Debentures due September 30, 2031

On October 3, 2001, Devon, through Devon Financing
Corporation, U.L.C. (“Devon Financing”), sold these
notes and debentures which are unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of Devon Financing. Devon has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated
basis the obligations of Devon Financing under the debt
securities. The proceeds from the issuance of these debt
securities were used to fund a portion of the Anderson
acquisition. The $3 billion of debt securities were
structured in a manner that results in an expected weighted
average after-tax borrowing rate of approximately 1.65%.

7.95% Notes due April 15, 2032

On March 25, 2002, Devon sold these notes which are
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon. The net
proceeds received, after discounts and issuance costs, were
$986 million and were partially used to pay down
$820 million on Devon’s $3 billion term loan

was used in June 2002 to partially fund the early extinguishment
of $175 million of 8.75% senior subordinated notes due

expense in the accompanying 2005 statement of operations.
The after-tax effect of the $51 million premium was
$34 million.

Interest Expense

Following are the components of interest expense for the years
2005, 2004 and 2003:

Effects of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates

Devon had $400 million of 6.75% fixed-rate senior notes
payable by one of its Canadian subsidiaries. However, the notes
were denominated in U.S. dollars. Changes in the exchange
rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar from
the dates the notes were assumed as part of an acquisition to
the date of repayment increased or decreased the expected amount
of Canadian dollars eventually required to repay the notes. Such
changes in the Canadian dollar equivalent of the debt and
certain cash and other working capital amounts of Devon’s
Canadian subsidiary which are also denominated in
U.S. dollars are required to be included in determining net
earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changed.
Devon redeemed these notes on September 12, 2005, and, as a
result of changes in the rate of conversion of Canadian dollars
to U.S. dollars, $9 million, $22 million, and
$69 million was recorded as a reduction of expense in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Income Taxes

At December 31, 2005, Devon had the following net operating
loss carryforwards which are available to reduce future taxable
income in the jurisdiction where the net operating loss was
incurred. These carryforwards will result in a future tax
reduction based upon the future tax rate applicable to the
taxable income that is ultimately offset by the net operating
loss carryforward.

In October 2004, Congress enacted new tax legislation that
creates a new U.S. tax deduction which will be phased in
starting in 2005 for companies with domestic production
activities, including oil and gas extraction. This deduction
provided a $25 million tax benefit in 2005.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, total income tax expense was reduced
by the effects of Canadian statutory rate reductions. As
presented in the table above, these rate reductions resulted in
$14 million, $36 million and $218 million
benefits in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the
lower tax rates being applied to deferred tax liabilities
outstanding as of the beginning of the year.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities
at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are presented below:

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
$640 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
2005. Such amount includes $148 million from various
carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The
carryforwards include federal net operating loss carryforwards
which do not expire until 2022, state net operating loss
carryforwards which expire primarily between 2006 and 2022,
Canadian net operating loss carryforwards which expire primarily
between 2008 and 2015, and Azerbaijani net operating loss
carryforwards and U.S. minimum tax credit carryforwards
which have no expiration. The tax benefits of carryforwards are
recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the
utilization of such carryforwards to be “more likely than
not.” When the future utilization of some portion of the
carryforwards is determined not to be “more likely than
not,” a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the
recorded tax benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the net operating loss
carryforwards to be utilized between 2006 and 2009. Such
expectation is based upon current estimates of taxable income
during this period, considering limitations on the annual
utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax regulations.
Significant changes in such estimates caused by variables such
as future oil and gas prices or capital expenditures

could alter the timing of the eventual utilization of such
carryforwards. There can be no assurance that Devon will
generate any specific level of continuing taxable earnings.
However, management believes that Devon’s future taxable
income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize
substantially all its tax carryforwards prior to their
expiration.

Stockholders’ Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of
800 million shares of common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, and 4.5 million shares of preferred
stock, par value $1.00 per share. The preferred stock may
be issued in one or more series, and the terms and rights of
such stock will be determined by the Board of Directors.

Effective August 17, 1999, Devon issued 1.5 million
shares of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock, Series A, to
holders of PennzEnergy 6.49% cumulative preferred stock,
Series A. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative
from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly, in
cash, when declared by the Board of Directors. The preferred
stock is redeemable at the option of Devon at any time on or
after June 2, 2008, in whole or in part, at a redemption
price of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends
to the redemption date.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated a certain number
of shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
Preferred Stock”) in connection with the adoption of the
shareholder rights plan described later in this note. On
April 25, 2003, the Board increased the designated shares
from 2.0 million to 2.9 million. At December 31,
2005, there were no shares of Series A Junior Preferred
Stock issued or outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred
Stock is entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per
share equal to the greater of $1.00 or 200 times the aggregate
per share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends)
declared on common stock since the immediately preceding
quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first
payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior
Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred
Stock are entitled to 200 votes per share (subject to adjustment
to prevent dilution) on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
neither redeemable nor convertible. The Series A Junior
Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but junior to
all other classes of Preferred Stock.

On September 27, 2004, Devon announced a stock repurchase
program to repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common
stock. During 2004, Devon repurchased 5 million shares at a
total cost of $189 million, or $37.78 per share. This
program was completed in 2005, during which Devon repurchased
44.6 million shares at a total cost of $2.1 billion,
or $47.69 per share. The total cost of this program was
$2.3 billion, or $46.69 per share.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On August 3, 2005, Devon announced another program to
repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common stock.
This second stock repurchase program is planned to extend
through 2007. Shares may be purchased from time to time
depending upon market conditions. Devon plans to repurchase
shares in the open market and in privately negotiated
transactions. This stock repurchase program may be discontinued
at any time. During 2005, Devon repurchased 2.2 million
shares at a cost of $134 million, or $60.16 per share,
under this program.

At December 31, 2003, a subsidiary of Devon created in the
Ocean merger had 38,000 shares of convertible preferred
stock outstanding. In January 2004, these shares of convertible
preferred stock were canceled and converted to
2,197,160 shares of Devon common stock pursuant to an
automatic conversion feature of the preferred stock. The
automatic conversion feature was triggered when the closing
price of Devon common stock equaled or exceeded the forced
conversion price of $26.20 for 20 consecutive trading days.

Equity Compensation Plans

On June 8, 2005, Devon’s stockholders adopted the 2005
Long-Term Incentive Plan which expires on June 8, 2013.
This plan authorizes the compensation committee, which consists
of non-management members of Devon’s Board of Directors, to
grant nonqualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock
awards, restricted stock units, performance units and
performance bonuses to selected employees. The plan also
authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards to directors. A total of 32 million
shares of Devon common stock have been reserved for issuance
pursuant to the plan. To calculate shares issued under the plan,
options granted represent one share and other awards represent
2.2 shares.

The exercise price of stock options granted under the plans may
not be less than the estimated fair market value of the stock at
the date of grant. Options granted under the plans are
exercisable during a period established for each grant, which
period may not exceed eight years from the date of grant. In
addition, the grantee must pay the exercise price in cash or in
common stock, or a combination thereof, at the time that the
option is exercised. Restricted stock awards granted under the
plans are subject to pro rata vesting over at least a three-year
period. During this vesting period, the fair value of the
restricted stock awards granted is recognized pro rata as
general and administrative expenses.

Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2003,
1997 and 1993 under which stock options and restricted stock
awards were issued to key management and professional employees.
Options granted under these plans remain exercisable by the
employees owning such options, but no new options or restricted
stock awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has
stock options outstanding that were assumed as part of the
acquisitions of Ocean, Mitchell Energy & Development
Corp., Santa Fe Snyder and PennzEnergy.

Shareholder Rights Plan

Under Devon’s shareholder rights plan, stockholders have
one half of one right for each share of common stock held. The
rights become exercisable and separately transferable ten
business days after (a) an announcement that a person has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
voting shares outstanding, or (b) commencement of a tender
or exchange offer that could result in a person owning 15% or
more of the voting shares outstanding.

Each right entitles its holder (except a holder who is the
acquiring person) to purchase either (a) 1/100 of a share
of Series A Preferred Stock for $185.00, subject to
adjustment or, (b) Devon common stock with a value equal to
twice the exercise price of the right, subject to adjustment to
prevent dilution. In the event of certain merger or asset sale
transactions with another party or transactions which would
increase the equity ownership of a shareholder who then owned
15% or more of Devon, each Devon right will entitle its holder
to purchase securities of the merging or acquiring party with a
value equal to twice the exercise price of the right.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The rights, which have no voting power, expire on
August 17, 2009. The rights may be redeemed by Devon for
$0.01 per right until the rights become exercisable.

Dividends

Dividends on Devon’s common stock were paid in 2005, 2004
and 2003 at a per share rate of $0.075, $0.05 and
$0.025 per quarter, respectively.

(a) an internal discounted cash flow calculation,
(b) quotes obtained from the counterparty to the hedge
agreement or (c) quotes provided by brokers.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

— The fair values
of the interest rate swaps are based on internal discounted cash
flow calculations, using market quotes of future interest rates,
or quotes obtained from counterparties.

Embedded Option in Exchangeable Debentures

—
The fair value of the embedded option is based on a quote
obtained from a broker.

Long-term Debt

— The fair values of the
fixed-rate long-term debt are based on quotes obtained from
brokers or by discounting the principal and interest payments at
rates available for debt of similar terms and maturity. The fair
values of the floating-rate long-term debt are estimated to
approximate the carrying amounts due to the fact that the
interest rates paid on such debt are generally set for periods
of three months or less.

Retirement Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for U.S. and
Canadian employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
employee’s years of service and compensation and are funded
from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

Devon has a funding policy regarding the Qualified Plans such
that it will contribute the amount of funds necessary so that
the Qualified Plans’ assets will be approximately equal to
the related accumulated benefit obligation. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of the Qualified
Plans’ assets were $533 million and $456 million,
respectively, which was $37 million and $11 million
more, respectively, than the related accumulated benefit
obligation. The actual amount of contributions required during
future periods will depend on investment returns from the plan
assets during the same period as well as changes in long-term
interest rates.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
are based on the employee’s years of service and
compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
established trusts to fund these plans’ benefit
obligations. The total values of these trusts were
$59 million and $60 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively, and are included in non-current other
assets in the consolidated balance sheets. For the remaining
Supplemental Plans for which trusts have not been established,
benefits are funded from Devon’s available cash and cash
equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
(“Postretirement Plans”) which provide benefits for
substantially all employees. The Postretirement Plans provide
medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and are,
depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
Plans are estimated based on future cost-sharing changes that
are consistent with Devon’s expressed intent to increase,
where possible, contributions from future retirees. Devon’s
funding policy for the Postretirement Plans is to fund the
benefits as they become payable with available cash and cash
equivalents.

Benefit Obligations

In 2005, Devon accelerated the date for actuarial measurement of
its pension and postretirement benefit plans’ obligations
from December 31 to November 30. Devon believes the
one-month acceleration of the measurement date is a preferred
change as it allows adequate time for Devon management to
evaluate and report the actuarial pension and postretirement
measurements, while facilitating the timely preparation of
year-end financial statements. The effect of the change on the
obligation and assets of the



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

pension and postretirement benefit plans did not have a material
cumulative effect on the net periodic benefit cost or benefit
obligation. Accordingly, all amounts reported in the tables
below for the year ended December 31, 2005, are based on a
measurement date of November 30, 2005, and amounts reported
for the year ended December 31, 2004, are based upon a
measurement date of December 31, 2004.

The following table presents the plans’ benefit obligations
and the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to calculate
such obligations at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The benefit
obligation for pension plans represents the projected benefit
obligation, while the benefit obligation for the postretirement
benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit obligation. The
accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected
benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption
about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit
obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2005 and 2004
was $607 million and $542 million, respectively.

Future pension and postretirement obligations are discounted at
the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations
could be effectively settled, considering the timing of
estimated benefit payments. This rate is based on high-quality
bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk. High
quality corporate bond yield indices, such as Moody’s Aa,
are considered when selecting the discount rate.

For measurement purposes, a 10% annual rate of increase in the
per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for
2006. The rate was assumed to decrease one percent annually to
5% in the year 2011 and remain at that level thereafter. A
one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care cost trend
rates would increase the December 31, 2005 postretirement
benefit obligation by $2 million, while a
one-percentage-point decrease in the same rate would decrease
the postretirement benefit obligation by $1 million.

Plan Assets

The following table presents the plans’ assets at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The plan assets for pension benefits in the table above excludes
the assets held in trusts for the Supplemental Plans. However,
employer contributions for pension benefits in the table above
include $5 million in 2005 and $6 million in 2004
which were transferred from the trusts established for the
Supplemental Plans.

Devon’s overall investment objective for its retirement
plans’ assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested
capital to ensure payments of retirement benefits obligations
can be funded when required. To assist in achieving this
objective, Devon has established certain investment strategies,
including target allocation percentages and permitted and
prohibited investments, designed to mitigate risks inherent with
investing. At December 31, 2005, the target investment
allocation for Devon’s plan assets is 50% U.S. large
cap equity securities; 15% U.S. small cap equity
securities, equally allocated between growth and value; 15%
international equity securities, equally allocated between
growth and value; and 20% debt securities. Derivatives or other
speculative investments considered high-risk are generally
prohibited.

The asset allocation for Devon’s retirement plans at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the target allocation for
2006, by asset category, follows:

Net Periodic Cost

The following table presents the plans’ net periodic
benefit cost and the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used
to calculate such cost for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by
evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
well as long-term inflation assumptions. Devon expects the
long-term asset allocation to approximate the targeted
allocation. Therefore, the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets is based on the target allocation of investment
types in such assets.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit
plans. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost trend rates would affect the total service and interest
cost by less than $1 million.

In December 2003, the

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003

(“the Act”) was
signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare (“Medicare Part D”) as well as a
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
to Medicare Part D. In May 2004 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
No. 106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003”

(“FSP 106-2”). If
the benefit provided is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D, FSP 106-2 requires companies to account
for the effect of the subsidy on benefits attributable to past
service as an actuarial experience gain that reduces the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and for benefits
attributable to current service as a reduction of the service
cost included in net periodic benefit cost. FSP 106-2 is
effective for the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2004. Because benefits provided to certain
participants in the Postretirement Plans will be at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, Devon would be
entitled to some subsidy. As a result, Devon reduced the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at July 1,
2004, by $4 million and the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by $0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. However, Devon made a decision during
2005 to not apply for the subsidy. Therefore, the amounts
reported for 2005 do not reflect the impact of any potential
subsidy.

Expected Cash Flows

Information about the expected cash flows for the pension and
other postretirement benefit plans follows:

Expected employer contributions included in the table above
include amounts related to Devon’s Qualified Plans,
Supplemental Plans and Postretirement Plans. Of the benefits
expected to be paid in 2006, $7 million is expected to be
funded from the trusts established for the Supplemental Plans
and $5 million is expected to be funded from Devon’s
available cash and cash equivalents. Expected employer
contributions and benefit payments for other postretirement
benefits are presented net of employee contributions.

Other Benefit Plans

Devon has incurred certain postemployment benefits to former or
inactive employees who are not retirees. These benefits include
salary continuance, severance and disability health care and
life insurance. The accrued postemployment benefit liability was
approximately $5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Devon has a 401(k) Incentive Savings Plan which covers all
domestic employees. At its discretion, Devon may match a certain
percentage of the employees’ contributions to the plan. The
matching percentage is determined annually by the Board of
Directors. Devon’s matching contributions to the plan were
$12 million, $11 million and $10 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee which is
based upon the employee’s base compensation and
classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
additional Devon contributions. During 2005, 2004 and 2003,
Devon’s combined contributions to the Canadian defined
contribution plan and the Canadian savings plan were
$10 million, $9 million and $8 million,
respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and
settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by
management to involve future amounts that would be material to
Devon’s financial position or results of operations after
consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could
differ materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
environmental remediation activities associated with past
operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these
activities, accruals have been established when reasonable
estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include
estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used
discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for
environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible
recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to
environmental costs have been recognized in Devon’s
consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals
when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation
estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of Devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers
are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
by third parties. As of December 31, 2005, Devon’s
consolidated balance sheet included $4 million of
non-current accrued liabilities, reflected in “Other
liabilities,” related to these and other environmental
remediation liabilities. Devon does not currently believe there
is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material
costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such
environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites
in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs, Devon’s conclusion is
based in large part on (i) Devon’s participation in
consent decrees with both other PRPs and the Environmental
Protection Agency, which provide for performing the scope of
work required for remediation and contain covenants not to sue
as protection to the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as
a

de minimis PRP,

and (iii) the availability of
other defenses to liability. As a result, Devon’s monetary
exposure is not expected to be material.

Royalty Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
and related parties used below-market prices, improper
deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and
sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The
principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is United States ex
rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. (the
“Wright case”). The suit was originally filed in
August 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000 with the
other suits for pre-trial proceedings in the United States
District Court for the District of Wyoming. On July 10,
2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to
the Eastern District of Texas to resume proceedings. Trial is
set for February 2007 if the suit continues to advance. Devon
believes that it has acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong
defenses to all allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties
in good faith. Devon does not currently believe that it is
subject to material exposure in association with this lawsuit
and no liability has been recorded in connection therewith.

Devon has been a defendant in certain private royalty owner
litigation filed in Wyoming regarding deductibility of certain
post production costs from royalties payable by Devon. A
significant portion of such production is, or will be,
transported through facilities owned by Thunder Creek Gas
Services, L.L.C., of



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

which Devon owns a 75% interest. During 2005, all of the
litigation was resolved for amounts immaterial to Devon.

Equatorial Guinea Investigation

The SEC has been conducting an inquiry into payments made to the
government of Equatorial Guinea, and to officials and persons
affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial
Guinea. On August 9, 2005, Devon received a subpoena issued
by the SEC pursuant to a formal order of investigation. Devon
has cooperated fully with the SEC’s previous requests for
information in this inquiry and plans to continue to work with
the SEC in connection with its formal investigation.

Hurricane Contingencies

Devon maintains a comprehensive insurance program that includes
coverage for physical damage to its offshore facilities caused
by hurricanes. Devon’s insurance program also includes
substantial business interruption coverage which Devon expects
to utilize to recover costs associated with the suspended
production related to hurricanes that struck the Gulf of Mexico
in the third quarter of 2005. Under the terms of the insurance
program, Devon is entitled to be reimbursed for the portion of
production suspended longer than forty-five days, subject to
upper limits to oil and natural gas prices. Also, the terms of
the insurance include a standard, per-event deductible of
$1 million for offshore losses as well as a
$15 million aggregate annual deductible. Based on current
estimates of physical damage and the anticipated length of time
Devon will have production suspended, Devon expects its policy
settlements will exceed repair costs and deductible amounts.
This expectation is based upon several variables, including the
actual amount of time that production is suspended, the actual
prices in effect while production is suspended and the timing of
collections of insurance proceeds. Should Devon’s policy
settlements exceed repair costs and deductible amounts, the
excess will be recognized as other income in the statement of
operations.

Other Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge
as of the date of this report, there were no other material
pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which
any of its property is subject.

Commitments

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under
contractual agreements with third party service providers to
procure drilling rigs and other drilling related services for
developmental and exploratory drilling.

Devon has certain firm transportation agreements which represent
“ship or pay” arrangements whereby Devon has committed
to ship certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed
transportation fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to
aid the movement of its gas production to market. Devon expects
to have sufficient production to utilize the majority of these
transportation services.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
administrative expenses under operating leases, net of sub-lease
income, was $35 million, $49 million and
$51 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003
Ocean merger. The spars are being used in the development of the
Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Boomvang
field was divested as part of the 2005 property divestiture
program. The Nansen operating lease is for a

20-year

term and
contains various options whereby Devon may purchase the
lessors’ interests in the spar.



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Total rental expense included in lease operating expenses under
both the Nansen and Boomvang operating leases was
$14 million, $17 million and $11 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Devon has guaranteed that the
Nansen spar will have a residual value at the end of the
operating leases equal to at least 10% of the fair value of the
spar at the inception of the lease. The total guaranteed value
is $14 million in 2022. However, such amount may be reduced
under the terms of the lease agreement. As a result of the sale
of the Boomvang field, Devon is subleasing the Boomvang Spar. If
the sublessee defaults on its obligation, Devon would be
required to continue making the lease payments and any
guaranteed payment required at the end of the term.

Devon has a floating, production, storage and offloading
facility (“FPSO”) that is being used in the Panyu
project offshore China and is being leased under operating lease
arrangements. This lease expires in September 2009. Devon was
also leasing an FPSO that is being used in the Zafiro field
offshore Equatorial Guinea. Devon and the other working interest
owners purchased this FPSO in the fourth quarter of 2005. Total
rental expense included in lease operating expenses under both
the China and Equatorial Guinea operating leases was
$19 million, $20 million and $6 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum payments

Reduction of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
limitation is the discounted estimated after-tax future net
revenues from proved oil and gas properties, excluding future
cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement
obligations included in the net book value of oil and gas
properties, plus the cost of properties not subject to
amortization. The ceiling is determined separately by country.
In calculating future net revenues, prices and costs used are
those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period. These
prices are not changed except where different prices are fixed
and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining
term of those contracts, including cash flow hedges in place. We
had no such hedges outstanding at December 31, 2005.

The net book value, less related deferred tax liabilities, is
compared to the ceiling on a quarterly and annual basis. Any
excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes, is
written off as an expense. An expense recorded in one period may
not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil
and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the
subsequent period.

Under the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations, acquired oil and gas properties are recorded at
estimated fair value as of the date of purchase. Devon estimates
such fair value using its



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimates of future oil, gas and NGL prices. In contrast, the
ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the
last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
indefinitely. Accordingly, the resulting value from the ceiling
calculation is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of
the reserves.

During 2005 and 2003, Devon reduced the carrying value of its
oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling limitations, as
well as due to unsuccessful exploratory activities. A summary of
these reductions and additional discussion is provided below.

2005 Reductions

Devon’s interests in Angola were acquired through the Ocean
Energy acquisition. Devon’s drilling program has been
unsuccessful in Angola, resulting in no proven reserves for the
country. After drilling a series of unsuccessful wells in the
fourth quarter of 2005, Devon determined that all of the Angolan
capitalized costs should be impaired. Devon has a commitment to
drill one additional well in Angola by the end of August 2006.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we were capitalizing the
costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in Brazil pending the
determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in
Brazil. We have been successful in our drilling efforts on block
BM-C-8 in Brazil, and are currently developing our Polvo project
on this block. The ultimate value of the Polvo project is
expected to be in excess of the sum of its related costs, plus
the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts in
Brazil which were capitalized. However, the Polvo proved
reserves will be recorded over a period of time. It is expected
that a small initial portion of the proved reserves ultimately
expected at Polvo will be recorded in 2006. Based on preliminary
estimates developed in the fourth quarter of 2005, the value of
this initial partial booking of proved reserves will not be
sufficient to offset the sum of the related proportionate Polvo
costs plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful
efforts. Therefore, we determined that the prior unsuccessful
costs unrelated to the Polvo project should be impaired. These
costs totaled approximately $42 million. There is no tax
benefit related to the Brazilian impairment.

2003 Reductions

The Egyptian reduction was primarily due to poor results of a
development well that was unsuccessful in the primary objective.
Partially as a result of this well, Devon revised Egyptian
proved reserves downward. The Russian reduction was primarily
the result of additional capital costs incurred as well as an



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

increase in operating costs. The Indonesian reduction was
primarily related to an increase in operating costs and a
reduction in proved reserves.

Additionally, during 2003, Devon elected to discontinue certain
exploratory activities in Ghana, certain properties in Brazil
and other smaller concessions. After meeting the drilling and
capital commitments on these properties, Devon determined that
these properties did not meet its internal criteria to justify
further investment. Accordingly, Devon recorded a charge
associated with the impairment of these properties.

14.

Segment Information

Devon manages its business by country. As such, Devon identifies
its segments based on geographic areas. Devon has three
reportable segments: its operations in the U.S., its operations
in Canada, and its international operations outside of North
America. Substantially all of these segments’ operations
involve oil and gas producing activities. Certain information
regarding such activities for each segment is included in
Note 15.

Following is certain financial information regarding
Devon’s segments for 2005, 2004 and 2003. The revenues
reported are all from external customers.

included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
$189 million, $172 million and $140 million in the
years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Also, Devon capitalizes
interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas
properties and major development projects of oil and gas
properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are included in
the costs shown in the preceding tables, were $70 million,
$70 million and $50 million in the years 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The following tables include revenues and expenses associated
directly with Devon’s oil and gas producing activities,
including general and administrative expenses directly related
to such producing activities. They do not include any allocation
of Devon’s interest costs or general corporate overhead
and, therefore, are not necessarily indicative of the
contribution to net earnings of Devon’s oil and gas

statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and NGL sales after
deducting costs, including depreciation, depletion and
amortization and after giving effect to permanent differences.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
    Flows

The accompanying tables reflect the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows relating to Devon’s
interest in proved reserves:



DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices
(averaging $45.50 per barrel of oil, $7.84 per Mcf of
gas and $32.46 per barrel of natural gas liquids at
December 31, 2005) to the year-end quantities of proved
reserves, except in those instances where fixed and determinable
price changes are provided by contractual arrangements in
existence at year-end.

Future development and production costs are computed by
estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
producing proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year,
based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing
economic conditions. Of the $5.9 billion of future
development costs, $1.3 billion, $0.9 billion and
$0.6 billion are estimated to be spent in 2006, 2007 and
2008, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
Included as part of the $5.9 billion of future development
costs are $1.2 billion of future dismantlement, abandonment
and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
impact of future operations.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to Devon, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of
December 31, 2005 to ensure that the information required
to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for Devon, as such term is defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with
the participation of Devon’s management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officers, Devon
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this
evaluation under the COSO Framework which was completed on
February 10, 2006, management concluded that its internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
Devon’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm who audited
Devon’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2005, as stated in their report
which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting that Devon Energy Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Devon Energy Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Devon Energy
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Also, in our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Devon Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2005, and our report dated February 28,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.
