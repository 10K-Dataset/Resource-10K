PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries,
    (“Devon”) is an independent energy company engaged
    primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and
    production, the transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the
    processing of natural gas. We own oil and gas properties
    principally in the United States and Canada and, to a lesser
    degree, various regions located outside North America, including
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. We also own properties in West
    Africa and Egypt that we intend to sell in 2007. In addition to
    our oil and gas operations, we have marketing and midstream
    operations primarily in North America. These include marketing
    natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and constructing and operating
    pipelines, storage and treating facilities and gas processing
    plants. A detailed description of our significant properties and
    associated 2006 developments can be found under
    “Item 2. Properties.”

We began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. In
    1988, our common stock began trading publicly on the American
    Stock Exchange under the symbol “DVN.” In October
    2004, we transferred our common stock listing to the New York
    Stock Exchange. Our principal and administrative offices are
    located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK

73102-8260

(telephone 405/235-3611).

Strategy

We have a two-pronged operating strategy. First, we invest the
    vast majority of our capital budget in low-risk exploitation and
    development projects on our extensive North American property
    base which provides reliable and repeatable production and
    reserves additions. To supplement that strategy, we annually
    invest a measured amount of capital in high-impact, long
    cycle-time projects to replenish our development inventory for
    the future. The philosophy that underlies the execution of this
    strategy is to strive to increase value on a per share basis by:

•

building oil and gas reserves and production;

•

exercising capital discipline;

•

preserving financial flexibility;

•

maintaining a low unit-cost structure; and

•

improving performance through our marketing and midstream
    operations.

Development
    of Business

During 1988, we expanded our capital base with our first
    issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a
    substantial expansion program that has continued through the
    subsequent years. This expansion is attributable to both a
    focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of
    years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling
    program. Total proved reserves increased from
    8 MMBoe


at year-end 1987 to
    2,376 MMBoe


at year-end 2006.

During the same time period, we have grown proved reserves from
    0.66
    Boe


per diluted share at the end of 1987 to 5.30
    Boe


per
    diluted share at the end of 2006. This represents a compound
    annual growth rate of 12%. We have also increased production
    from 0.09
    Boe


per
    diluted share in 1987 to 0.48
    Boe


per
    diluted share in 2006, for a compound annual growth rate of 9%.
    This per share growth is a direct result of successful execution
    of our strategic plan and other key transactions and events.


Excludes
    the effects of mergers in 1998 and 2000 that were accounted for
    as poolings of interests.


Excludes
    reserves in Egypt that are held for sale and classified as
    discontinued operations as of December 31, 2006.



We achieved a number of significant accomplishments in our
    operations during 2006, including those discussed below.

•

Barnett Shale Expansion

— We dramatically
    increased our presence in the Barnett Shale area of north Texas
    in 2006 with our $2.2 billion acquisition of Chief Holdings
    LLC (“Chief”). The acquired properties included
    estimated proved reserves of approximately 600 Bcf of
    natural gas equivalent and leasehold totaling 169,000 net
    acres with some 2,000 additional drilling locations.

•

U.S. Onshore Production and Reserves
    Growth

— Our U.S. onshore properties,
    including the Barnett Shale and the Groesbeck and Carthage areas
    in east Texas, showed strong production growth in 2006. These
    three areas, which accounted for a little over one-half of our
    U.S. onshore production, had production growth in 2006 of
    11% compared to 2005.

In addition to production growth, our U.S. onshore
    properties also demonstrated significant growth in proved
    reserves. U.S onshore production in 2006 of 110 MMBoe was
    more than offset by 265 MMBoe of additions from extensions
    and discoveries during the year, as well as 105 MMBoe added
    through acquisitions, primarily the Chief acquisition. The
    additional reserves added by drilling and acquisition activities
    caused our 2006 U.S. onshore proved reserves to increase
    21% compared to the end of 2005.

•

Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Development

— We
    continued to achieve success in 2006 with our deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico exploration program. To date, we have drilled four
    discovery wells in the Lower Tertiary trend — Cascade
    in 2002, St. Malo in 2003, Jack in 2004 and Kaskida in the third
    quarter of 2006. Also in the third quarter of 2006, we announced
    the successful production test of the Jack No. 2 well in
    the Lower Tertiary. These achievements support our positive view
    of the Lower Tertiary and demonstrate the growth potential of
    our high-impact exploration strategy on long-term production,
    reserves and value.

Specific Gulf of Mexico developments in 2006 included the
    following:

•

Along with our partners, we conducted a successful production
    test of the deepwater Jack No. 2 well in the Lower Tertiary
    trend. The successful production test was an important milestone
    in moving the Jack project, originally discovered in 2004,
    toward sanctioning and development. We have a 25% working
    interest in the Jack prospect.

•

Also in the Lower Tertiary trend, we increased our working
    interest in the Cascade project, discovered in 2002, from 25% to
    50%. We and our partner plan to develop Cascade using an FPSO
    vessel. We anticipate first production from Cascade in late 2009.

•

Elsewhere in the Lower Tertiary, we and our partners announced
    an oil discovery on the Kaskida prospect. Kaskida is our fourth
    discovery in the Lower Tertiary trend and our first in the
    Keathley Canyon deepwater lease area. We have identified 19
    additional exploratory prospects in the Lower Tertiary, and 12
    of these prospects are on our Keathley Canyon acreage. We
    believe that Kaskida, in which we own a 20% working interest, is
    the largest of our four Lower Tertiary discoveries to date.

•

In addition to our Lower Tertiary success, we also announced a
    Miocene-aged oil discovery on the Mission Deep prospect in the
    fourth quarter of 2006. The well, in 7,300 feet of water,
    was drilled to 25,000 feet and encountered more than
    250 feet of net oil pay. We have 15 additional prospects in
    our deepwater Miocene inventory. Our working interest in the
    Mission Deep prospect is 50%.

•

We secured long-term contracts for two deepwater drilling rigs
    in 2006. One of the rigs is scheduled for delivery in mid-2007,
    and the other is scheduled for delivery in mid-2008. With these
    two deepwater rigs under contract, we will have additional
    capacity and flexibility to test, appraise and develop multiple
    prospects in the Lower Tertiary and Miocene trends.

•

Jackfish

— During 2006, facilities construction
    and drilling continued at our 100% owned Jackfish thermal heavy
    oil project in Canada. We expect to commence steam injection at
    Jackfish in the second quarter of 2007, with estimated full
    production of 35,000 barrels of oil per day anticipated by
    the end of 2008.



•

Polvo

— Construction and fabrication for the
    Polvo oil development project offshore Brazil continued on
    schedule throughout 2006. We expect first production from Polvo
    in mid-2007. We operate Polvo with a 60% working interest.

On November 14, 2006, we announced our plans to divest our
    operations in Egypt. At December 31, 2006, our Egyptian
    operations had proved reserves of eight million Boe.
    Subsequently, on January 23, 2007, we announced our plans
    to divest our operations in West Africa, including Equatorial
    Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, and other countries in the region.
    At December 31, 2006, our West African operations had
    proved reserves of 90 million Boe. We anticipate completing
    the sale of our Egyptian operations in the first half of 2007
    and our West African operations in the third quarter of 2007.
    Divesting these properties will allow us to redeploy our
    financial and intellectual capital to the significant growth
    opportunities we have developed onshore in North America and in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we will sharpen our
    focus in North America and concentrate our international
    operations in Brazil and China, where we have established
    competitive advantages.

Pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations, our
    Egyptian operations were classified as discontinued operations
    at the end of 2006. Accordingly, we have classified all amounts
    related to our operations in Egypt as discontinued. Therefore,
    all amounts for all periods presented in this document related
    to our continuing operations exclude Egypt. Our West African
    operations did not meet the criteria to be considered
    discontinued operations at the end of 2006. Therefore, all
    amounts related to our operations in West Africa are still
    presented in this document as part of our continuing operations.
    Beginning in 2007, our operations in West Africa will be
    considered and classified as discontinued.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographical Areas

Notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
    our segments and geographical areas.

Oil and
    Natural Gas Marketing

The spot market for oil and gas is subject to volatility as
    supply and demand factors fluctuate. We may periodically enter
    into financial hedging arrangements, fixed-price contracts or
    firm delivery commitments with a portion of our oil and gas
    production. These activities are intended to support targeted
    price levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations.
    See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk.”

Oil
    Marketing

Our oil production is sold under both long-term (one year or
    more) and short-term (less than one year) agreements at prices
    negotiated with third parties. All of our oil production is sold
    at variable or market-sensitive prices.

Natural
    Gas Marketing

Our gas production is also sold under both long-term and
    short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties.
    Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2007,
    approximately 75% of our natural gas production was sold under
    short-term contracts at variable or market-sensitive prices.
    These market-sensitive sales are referred to as “spot
    market” sales. Another 23% of our production was committed
    under various long-term contracts which dedicate the natural gas
    to a purchaser for an extended period of time but still at
    market sensitive prices. Our remaining gas production was sold
    under long-term fixed price contracts.

Marketing
    and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations
    is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide
    such services by gathering, processing and marketing oil and gas
    production in a timely and efficient manner. Our most
    significant marketing and midstream asset is the Bridgeport



processing plant and gathering system located in North Texas.
    These facilities serve not only our gas production from the
    Barnett Shale but also gas production of other producers in the
    area.

Our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by:

•

selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams
    processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for
    marketing, and

•

selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport
    pipelines and unrelated third party pipelines.

Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily
    incurred from:

•

purchasing the gas streams entering our transport pipelines and
    plants;

•

purchasing fuel needed to operate our plants, compressors and
    related pipeline facilities;

•

purchasing third-party NGLs;

•

operating our plants, gathering systems and related
    facilities; and

•

transporting products on unrelated third-party pipelines.

Customers

We sell our gas production to a variety of customers including
    pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and
    local distribution companies. Existing gathering systems and
    interstate and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas
    sales and deliveries.

The principal customers for our crude oil production are
    refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have
    pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event
    pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is
    trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities.

During 2006, revenues received from ExxonMobil and its
    affiliates were $1.1 billion, or 10% of our consolidated
    revenues. No purchaser accounted for over 10% of our revenues in
    2005 or 2004.

Seasonal
    Nature of Business

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases
    during the summer months and increases during the winter months.
    Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes
    lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities,
    local distribution companies and industrial users utilize
    natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their
    anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also
    lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.

Government
    Regulation

The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of
    regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil
    and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review
    for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation,
    numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and
    regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
    individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
    for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a
    significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production and
    marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations
    increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
    profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and
    gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations
    are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to
    predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws
    and regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these
    laws and regulations will affect our operations in a manner
    materially different than they would affect other oil and gas
    companies of similar size.

The following are significant areas of government control and
    regulation in the United States, Canada and other international
    locations in which we operate.



Exploration
    and Production Regulation

Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal,
    state, provincial, local and international laws and regulations,
    including regulations related to the acquisition of seismic
    data; the location of wells; drilling and casing of wells; well
    production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation,
    storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil
    and gas operations; surface usage and the restoration of
    properties upon which wells have been drilled; the calculation
    and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes; the
    plugging and abandoning of wells; the transportation of
    production; and, in international operations, minimum
    investments in the country of operations.

Our operations are also subject to conservation regulations,
    including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing
    units or proration units; the number of wells which may be
    drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable from oil and
    natural gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and
    natural gas properties. In the United States, some states allow
    the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate
    exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of
    lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop
    oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws
    generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose
    certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of
    production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the
    amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and
    to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can
    drill.

Certain of our U.S. oil and natural gas leases are granted
    by the federal government and administered by various federal
    agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management and the
    Minerals Management Service (“MMS”) of the Department
    of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed
    federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other
    matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these
    leases, and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to
    the federal government. The MMS has been particularly active in
    recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new
    rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and
    royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands.
    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also has jurisdiction
    over certain U.S. offshore activities pursuant to the Outer
    Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Royalties
    and Incentives in Canada

The royalty system in Canada is a significant factor in the
    profitability of oil and natural gas production. Royalties
    payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are
    determined by negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties
    are determined by government regulation and are generally
    calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production,
    with the royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed
    reference prices, well productivity, geographical location,
    field discovery date and the type and quality of the petroleum
    product produced. From time to time, the federal and provincial
    governments of Canada have also established incentive programs
    such as royalty rate reductions, royalty holidays and tax
    credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and gas exploration
    or enhanced recovery projects. These incentives generally have
    the effect of increasing our revenues, earnings and cash flow.

Pricing
    and Marketing in Canada

An order from Canada’s National Energy Board
    (“NEB”) is required for oil and natural gas exports
    from Canada. Any oil or natural gas export to be made pursuant
    to an export contract of a certain duration or covering a
    certain quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export
    license from the NEB, which requires the approval of the
    Government of Canada. Exporters are free to negotiate prices and
    other terms with purchasers, provided that the export contracts
    meet certain criteria prescribed by the NEB. The governments of
    Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the
    volume of natural gas that may be removed from those provinces
    for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve
    availability, transportation arrangements and market
    considerations.



Investment
    Canada Act

The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada
    approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a
    Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by
    Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural
    resource properties may be considered to be a transaction
    requiring such approval.

Production
    Sharing Contracts

Many of our international licenses are governed by Production
    Sharing Contracts (“PSCs”) between the concessionaires
    and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that
    define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue
    sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries.
    Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms
    and time limits of generally 30 years. PSCs also generally
    contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. As a result,
    at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of
    return, PSCs generally allow the government partner to retain
    higher fractions of revenue.

Environmental
    and Occupational Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and
    international laws and regulations concerning occupational
    safety and health and the discharge of materials into, and the
    protection of, the environment. Environmental laws and
    regulations relate to, among other things, assessing the
    environmental impact of seismic acquisition, drilling or
    construction activities; the generation, storage, transportation
    and disposal of waste materials; the monitoring, abandonment,
    reclamation and remediation of well and other sites, including
    sites of former operations; and the development of emergency
    response and spill contingency plans. The application of
    worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000 governing Environmental
    Management Systems, are required to be implemented for some
    international oil and gas operations.

In 1997, numerous countries participated in an international
    conference under the United Nations Framework Convention on
    Climate Change and adopted an agreement known as the Kyoto
    Protocol (the “Protocol”). The Protocol became
    effective February 14, 2005, and requires reductions of
    certain emissions that contribute to atmospheric levels of
    greenhouse gases. Certain countries in which we operate (but not
    the United States) have ratified the Protocol. Presently, it is
    not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to
    comply with any laws or regulations developed to achieve such
    emissions reductions, but such expenditures could be
    substantial. In 2006, Devon published its Corporate Climate
    Change Position and Strategy. Key components of the strategy
    include initiation of energy conservation measures, tracking
    emerging climate changes legislation and publication of a
    corporate greenhouse gas emission inventory by the end of 2007.
    All provisions of the strategy are in progress.

We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and
    health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our
    business. With the efforts of our Environmental, Health and
    Safety Department, we have been able to plan for and comply with
    environmental and safety and health initiatives without
    materially altering our operating strategy. We anticipate making
    increased expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a
    result of the increasingly stringent laws relating to the
    protection of the environment. While our unreimbursed
    expenditures in 2006 concerning such matters were immaterial, we
    cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our
    future exposure concerning such matters.

We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to
    limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial
    environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and
    accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances.
    However, we do not maintain 100% coverage concerning any
    environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect
    to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a
    violation of law.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 4,600
    employees. We consider labor relations with our employees to be
    satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages or strikes
    pertaining to our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in
    general, are subject to a variety of risks. Although we have a
    diversified asset base, a strong balance sheet and a history of
    generating sufficient cash to fund capital expenditure and
    investment programs and to pay dividends, if any of the
    following risk factors should occur, our profitability,
    financial condition

and/or

liquidity could be materially impacted. As a result, holders of
    our securities could lose part or all of their investment in
    Devon.

Oil,
    Natural Gas and NGL Prices are Volatile

Our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and
    demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. A significant downward
    movement of the prices for these commodities could have a
    material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves,
    revenues and operating cash flows, as well as the level of
    planned drilling activities. Such a downward price movement
    could also have a material adverse effect on our profitability,
    the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and future
    growth. Historically, prices have been volatile and are likely
    to continue to be volatile in the future due to numerous factors
    beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited
    to:

•

consumer demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;

•

conservation efforts;

•

OPEC production restraints;

•

weather;

•

regional market pricing differences;

•

differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus
    heavy or sour crude) and Btu content of gas produced;

•

the level of imports and exports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels;

•

the overall economic environment; and

•

governmental regulations and taxes.

Estimates
    of Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
    geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir,
    particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of
    judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop
    different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue
    based on the same data. In addition, the reserve



estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over
    time as a result of several factors including additional
    development activity, the viability of production under varying
    economic conditions and variations in production levels and
    associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to existing
    reserve estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of
    these factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could have a
    material adverse effect on our estimates of future net revenue,
    as well as our financial condition and profitability. Additional
    discussion of our policies regarding estimating and recording
    reserves is described in “Item 2.
    Properties — Proved Reserves and Estimated Future Net
    Revenue.”

Discoveries
    or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a
    Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rate from oil and gas properties generally
    declines as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
    production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir
    pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved
    reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline
    materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful
    exploration and development activities or, through engineering
    studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells,
    secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves, or
    acquire additional properties containing proved reserves.
    Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related
    per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of
    success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.

Future
    Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve
    Substantial Costs

Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire
    properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are
    subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not
    encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The
    costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In
    addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling
    operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions;

•

lack of access to pipelines or other methods of transportation;

•

environmental hazards or liabilities; and

•

shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.

A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in
    a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular
    property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful
    in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an
    adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
    condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling
    activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves
    greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently performing
    exploratory drilling activities in certain international
    countries. We have been granted drilling concessions in these
    countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur
    capital expenditures. Even if future drilling activities are
    unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves, we will likely be
    required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital
    expenditures.



Industry
    Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be
    Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent
    oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases
    and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel
    required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
    is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Higher
    recent commodity prices have increased drilling and operating
    costs of existing properties. Higher prices have also increased
    the costs of properties available for acquisition, and there are
    a greater number of publicly traded companies and private-equity
    firms with the financial resources to pursue acquisition
    opportunities. Certain of our competitors have financial and
    other resources substantially larger than ours, and they have
    also established strategic long-term positions and maintain
    strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may
    seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive
    disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many
    of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when
    responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas
    production, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of
    production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and
    the application of government regulations.

International
    Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic and Other
    Risks

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and various countries in West Africa.
    As a result, we face political and economic risks and other
    uncertainties that are less prevalent for our operations in
    North America. Such factors include, but are not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental
    agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
    overall business and results of operations by distracting
    management’s attention from our more significant assets.
    Various regions of the world have a history of political and
    economic instability. This instability could result in new
    governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in
    a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment.
    In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of
    contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This
    could adversely affect our interests and our future
    profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines,



production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could
    be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of
    terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in
    the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.

Government
    Laws and Regulations Can Change

Our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in
    the United States, Canada and the other international countries
    in which we operate. In addition, we are also subject to the
    laws and regulations of various states, provinces and local
    governments. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous government
    departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and
    regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
    individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
    for failure to comply. Changes in such legislation have
    affected, and at times in the future could affect, our future
    operations. Political developments can restrict production
    levels, enact price controls, change environmental protection
    requirements, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts
    payable to governments or governmental agencies. Although we are
    unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such
    changes could significantly impact our profitability. While such
    legislation can change at any time in the future, those laws and
    regulations outside North America to which we are subject
    generally include greater risk of unforeseen change.

Environmental
    Matters and Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and
    international laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us
    for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from our operations in affected areas. Any future
    environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the
    environment are uncertain and will be governed by several
    factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.
    There is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or
    regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not
    have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Insurance
    Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration, development, production and processing of oil,
    natural gas and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen
    occurrences such as hurricanes, blowouts, cratering, fires and
    loss of well control. These occurrences can result in damage to
    or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to
    persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment.
    We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in
    accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that
    management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against
    all operational risks is not available to us. Due to changes in
    the marketplace following the 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf of
    Mexico, we currently have only a

de minimis

amount of
    coverage for any damage that may be caused by future named
    windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.

Item 1B.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of our properties consist of interests in
    developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage
    located in our core operating areas. These interests entitle us
    to drill for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from specific
    areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests
    and, to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net
    profits interests, foreign government concessions and other
    forms of direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and
    NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant
    midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region
    in North Texas. These assets include approximately
    2,700 miles of pipeline, two gas processing plants with
    680 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a 15 MBbls per
    day NGL fractionator.



Proved
    Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated
    quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs which geological
    and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of
    the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of
    changes in existing prices provided only by contractual
    arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
    conditions.

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment as discussed in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As a result, we have
    developed internal policies for estimating and recording
    reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved
    reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
    guidance, and assign responsibilities for reserves bookings to
    our Reserve Evaluation Group (the “Group”). Our
    policies also require that reserve estimates be made by
    qualified reserves estimators (“QREs”), as defined by
    the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards. A list of
    our QREs is kept by the Senior Advisor — Corporate
    Reserves. All QREs are required to receive education covering
    the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.

The Group is responsible for internal reserves evaluation and
    certification and includes the Manager — E&P
    Budgets and Reserves and the Senior Advisor —
    Corporate Reserves. The Group reports independently of any of
    our operating divisions. The Vice President — Planning
    and Evaluation is directly responsible for overseeing the Group
    and reports to the President of Devon. No portion of the
    Group’s compensation is dependent on the quantity of
    reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
    operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
    reserves that are audited include major fields and major
    additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group
    reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum
    consultants discussed below.

In addition to internal audits, we engage three independent
    petroleum consulting firms to both prepare and audit a
    significant portion of our proved reserves. Ryder Scott Company,
    L.P. prepared the 2006 reserves estimates for all our offshore
    Gulf of Mexico properties and for 99% of our International
    proved reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the
    2006 reserves estimates for 87% of our domestic onshore
    properties. AJM Petroleum Consultants prepared estimates
    covering 46% of our 2006 Canadian reserves and audited an
    additional 39% of our Canadian reserves.

Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were
    evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and
    2004.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    which were estimated by our employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.



In addition to internal and external reviews, three independent
    members of our Board of Directors have been assigned to a
    Reserves Committee. The Reserves Committee meets at lease twice
    a year to discuss reserves issues and policies and periodically
    meets separately with our senior reserves engineering personnel
    and our independent petroleum consultants. The Reserves
    Committee assists the Board of Directors with the oversight of
    the following:

•

the annual review and evaluation of our consolidated oil, gas
    and NGL reserves;

•

the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting system;

•

our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to
    reserves evaluation, preparation, and disclosure;

•

the qualifications and independence of our independent
    engineering consultants; and

•

our business practices and ethical standards in relation to the
    preparation and disclosure of reserves.



The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and
    the related estimated pre-tax future net revenues, pre-tax 10%
    present value and after-tax standardized measure of discounted
    future net cash flows as of December 31, 2006. These
    estimates correspond with the method used in presenting the
    “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations”
    in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements
    included herein.

Gas reserves are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf per Bbl
    of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of
    natural gas to oil, which rate is not necessarily indicative of
    the relationship of gas to oil prices. NGL reserves are
    converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil.

(2)

Estimated pre-tax future net revenue represents estimated future
    revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves,
    net of estimated production and development costs and site
    restoration and abandonment charges. The amounts shown do not
    give effect to non-property related expenses such as debt
    service and future income tax expense or to depreciation,
    depletion and amortization.



These amounts were calculated using prices and costs in effect
    for each individual property as of December 31, 2006. These
    prices were not changed except where different prices were fixed
    and determinable from applicable contracts. These assumptions
    yield average prices over the life of our properties of
    $46.11 per Bbl of oil, $5.06 per Mcf of natural gas
    and $27.63 per Bbl of NGLs. These prices compare to the
    December 31, 2006, NYMEX cash price of $61.05 per Bbl
    for crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $5.64 per
    MMBtu for natural gas.

The present value of after-tax future net revenues discounted at
    10% per annum (“standardized measure”) was
    $16.6 billion at the end of 2006. Included as part of
    standardized measure were discounted future income taxes of
    $7.5 billion. Excluding these taxes, the present value of
    our pre-tax future net revenue (“pre-tax 10% present
    value”) was $24.1 billion. We believe the pre-tax 10%
    present value is a useful measure in addition to the after-tax
    standardized measure. The pre-tax 10% present value assists in
    both the determination of future cash flows of the current
    reserves as well as in making relative value comparisons among
    peer companies. The after-tax standardized measure is dependent
    on the unique tax situation of each individual company, while
    the pre-tax 10% present value is based on prices and discount
    factors which are more consistent from company to company. We
    also understand that securities analysts use the pre-tax 10%
    present value measure in similar ways.

(3) See Note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data.”

As presented in the previous table, we had 1,674 MMBoe of
    proved developed reserves at December 31, 2006. Proved
    developed reserves consist of proved developed producing
    reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves. The
    following table provides additional information regarding our
    proved developed reserves at December 31, 2006.

No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or
    included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental
    authority or agency since the beginning of the last fiscal year
    except in filings with the SEC and



the Department of Energy (“DOE”). Reserve estimates
    filed with the SEC correspond with the estimates of our reserves
    contained herein. Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based
    upon the same underlying technical and economic assumptions as
    the estimates of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE
    requires reports to include the interests of all owners in wells
    that we operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do
    not operate.

The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
    attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect
    market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to
    December 31, 2006. There can be no assurance that all of
    the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods
    indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that
    existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

Operation
    of Properties

The

day-to-day

operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of
    an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements.
    The operator supervises production, maintains production
    records, employs field personnel and performs other functions.



We are the operator of 22,434 of our wells. As operator, we
    receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
    performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing
    and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
    in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the
    monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
    administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.

Organization
    Structure and Property Profiles

Our properties are located within the U.S. onshore and
    offshore regions, Canada, and certain locations outside North
    America. The following table presents proved reserve information
    for our significant properties as of December 31, 2006,
    along with their production volumes for the year 2006. Included
    in the table are certain U.S. offshore properties which
    currently have no proved reserves or production. Such properties
    are considered significant because they may be the source of
    significant growth in proved reserves and production in the
    future. Also included in the table are properties located in
    West Africa that we intend to sale in 2007. The table does not
    include our Egyptian operations that were classified as
    discontinued at the end of 2006. Additional summary profile
    information for our significant properties is provided following

U.S. Onshore

Barnett Shale

— The Barnett Shale, located in
    north central Texas, is our largest property both in terms of
    production and proved reserves. Our leases include approximately
    725,000 net acres located primarily in Denton, Johnson,
    Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties. The Barnett Shale is a
    non-conventional reservoir and it produces natural gas and
    natural gas liquids. We have an average working interest in the
    Barnett Shale of greater than 90%.

During 2006, we acquired additional Barnett Shale assets from
    Chief. The Chief acquisition added approximately 100 MMBoe
    of proved reserves, 169,000 net acres and some 2,000
    additional drilling locations to our Barnett Shale holdings. We
    drilled 383 gross wells in the Barnett Shale in 2006 and
    expect to drill 385 gross wells in the area in 2007.

Carthage

— The Carthage area in east Texas
    includes primarily Harrison, Marion, Panola and Shelby counties.
    We hold approximately 126,000 net acres in the area. Our
    Carthage area wells produce primarily natural gas and natural
    gas liquids from conventional reservoirs. Our average working
    interest in this area is about 85%. We drilled 122 gross
    wells at Carthage in 2006 and plan to drill 150 gross wells
    in the area in 2007.

Permian Basin, Texas

— Our oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of west Texas comprise
    approximately 1.2 million net acres. Our acreage is located
    primarily in Andrews, Crane, Martin, Terry, Ward and Yoakum
    counties. The Permian Basin produces both oil and natural gas
    from conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest in
    these properties is about 40%. We drilled 95 gross wells in
    the Permian Basin of west Texas in 2006, and we plan to drill
    another 100 gross wells in the area in 2007.

Washakie

— Our Washakie area leases are
    concentrated in Carbon and Sweetwater counties in southern
    Wyoming. We hold about 157,000 net acres in the Washakie
    area. Washakie produces primarily natural gas from conventional
    reservoirs. Our average working interest in the Washakie area is
    about 76%. In 2006, we drilled 137 wells at Washakie, and
    we plan to drill another 105 wells in the area in 2007.

Groesbeck

— The Groesbeck area of east Texas
    includes portions of Freestone, Leon, Limestone and Robertson
    counties. We hold about 173,000 net acres of land in the
    Groesbeck area. Groesbeck produces primarily natural gas from
    conventional reservoirs. Our average working interest in the
    area is approximately 72%. In 2006, we drilled 31 gross
    wells in the area. Our plans anticipate drilling 34 additional
    gross wells in the Groesbeck area in 2007.

Permian Basin, New Mexico

— We also own oil and
    gas properties in the Permian Basin in south eastern New Mexico.
    We hold about 342,000 net acres concentrated in Eddy and
    Lea counties. We produce conventional oil and natural gas from
    the Permian Basin in New Mexico, and have an average working
    interest of about 75% in these properties. In 2006, we drilled
    82 gross wells in this area, and we expect to drill another
    44 gross wells in 2007.

U.S. Offshore

Deepwater Producing

— Our assets in the Gulf of
    Mexico include four significant producing properties located in
    deep water (greater than 600 feet). These properties are
    Magnolia, Nansen, Red Hawk and Zia. They are all located on
    federal leases and total approximately 48,000 net acres.
    The properties produce both crude oil and natural gas. Our
    working interest is 65% in Zia and 50% in each of the other
    three properties.



We drilled a total of two gross deepwater producing wells in
    2006 and expect to drill four additional gross wells in 2007.

Deepwater Development

— In addition to our four
    significant deepwater producing properties, we are in the
    process of developing two other deepwater projects, Merganser
    and Cascade. Merganser and Cascade are located on federal leases
    encompassing a total of approximately 11,500 net acres. We
    have 50% working interests in both properties.

We drilled two producing wells at Merganser in 2006. These wells
    are expected to commence producing natural gas in mid-2007. No
    additional drilling is planned at Merganser.

We announced in 2006 our plans to develop the 2002 Cascade
    discovery using an FPSO vessel. Cascade is expected to begin
    producing primarily oil in late 2009. Additional drilling at
    Cascade is in the planning stage.

Deepwater Exploration

— Our exploration program
    in the Gulf of Mexico is focused primarily on deepwater
    opportunities. Our deepwater exploratory prospects include
    Miocene-aged objectives (five million to 24 million years)
    and older and deeper Lower Tertiary objectives. We hold federal
    leases comprising approximately 1.2 million net acres in
    our deepwater exploration inventory.

In 2006, various drilling and testing operations provided
    evidence that our Lower Tertiary properties may be a source of
    meaningful reserve and production growth in the future. Prior to
    2006, we had drilled three discovery wells in the Lower
    Tertiary. These include Cascade in 2002 (see “Deepwater
    Development” above), St. Malo in 2003 and Jack in 2004.
    Operations in 2006 included a successful production test of the
    Jack No. 2 well and participation in the Kaskida discovery,
    which is our fourth Lower Tertiary discovery. We currently hold
    273 blocks in the Lower Tertiary and have identified 19
    additional prospects to date.

At St. Malo, in which our working interest is 22.5%, we plan to
    drill a second delineation well in late 2007 or early 2008. At
    Jack, where our working interest is 25%, we continue to evaluate
    with our partners our development options following the
    successful production test in 2006.

In addition to the 2006 Kaskida discovery, a subsequent
    sidetrack well at Kaskida was drilled in 2006 and another well
    operation is planned for 2007. Our working interest in Kaskida
    is 20%, and we believe Kaskida is the largest of our four Lower
    Tertiary discoveries to date. The Kaskida discovery was our
    first in the Keathley Canyon deepwater lease area. Twelve of the
    19 additional Lower Tertiary exploratory prospects we have
    identified to date are on our Keathley Canyon acreage.

Also in 2006, we participated in a Miocene discovery on the
    Mission Deep prospect in which we have a 50% working interest.
    We have fifteen additional prospects in our deepwater Miocene
    inventory.

In total, we drilled three exploratory and delineation wells in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2006, and plan to drill six such
    wells in 2007. Our working interests in these exploratory
    opportunities range from 20% to 100%.

Canada

Jackfish

— We are currently developing our
    100%-owned Jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the
    non-conventional oil sands of east central Alberta. We will
    employ steam-assisted gravity drainage at Jackfish, and we
    expect to begin steam injection in the second quarter of 2007.
    Production is expected to eventually reach 35,000 barrels
    per day by the end of 2008 We drilled 19 pairs of producing and
    steam-injection wells in 2006, bringing the total number of
    well-pairs to 24. We hold approximately 80,000 net acres in
    the entire Jackfish area, which can support expansion of the
    original project. We requested regulatory approval in late
    September 2006 to increase the scope and size of the original
    project. We expect to decide in 2007 whether to proceed with
    this expansion, which could eventually add an additional
    35,000 barrels per day of production.

Deep Basin

— Our properties in Canada’s
    Deep Basin include portions of west central Alberta and east
    central British Columbia. We hold approximately 646,000 net
    acres in the Deep Basin. The area produces primarily natural gas
    and natural gas liquids from conventional reservoirs. Our
    average working interest in the



Deep Basin is 46%. We drilled 115 gross wells in the Deep
    Basin in 2006 and plan to drill 57 gross wells in the area
    in 2007.

Lloydminster

— Our Lloydminster properties are
    located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and
    western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by
    conventional means without steam injection. We hold
    2.1 million net acres and have a 97% average working
    interest in our Lloydminster properties. In 2006, we drilled
    397 gross wells in the area and plan to drill
    395 gross wells in 2007.

Peace River Arch

— The Peace River Arch is
    located in west central Alberta. We hold approximately
    476,000 net acres in the area, which produces primarily
    natural gas and natural gas liquids from conventional
    reservoirs. Our average working interest in the area is about
    69%. We drilled 82 gross wells in the Peace River Arch in
    2006, and we expect to drill 62 additional wells here in 2007.

Northeast British Columbia

— Our Northeast
    British Columbia properties are located primarily in British
    Columbia and to a lesser extent in north western Alberta. We
    hold approximately 1.2 million net acres in the area. These
    properties produce principally natural gas from conventional
    reservoirs. We hold a 72% average working interest in these
    properties. We drilled 64 gross wells in the area in 2006,
    and we plan to drill 68 wells here in 2007.

International

Azerbaijan

— Outside North America,
    Devon’s largest international property in terms of proved
    reserves is the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (“ACG”) oil
    field located offshore Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea. Our
    production from ACG increased significantly in late 2006
    following the payout of carried interest agreements with various
    partners in the field. Our production will increase again in
    2007 as we benefit from a full year of the higher ownership
    interest after these payouts. We expect our share of ACG
    production in 2007 to total approximately 12 MMBoe. ACG
    produces crude oil from conventional reservoirs. We hold
    approximately 6,000 net acres in the ACG field and have a
    5.6% working interest. In 2006, we participated in drilling
    15 gross wells at ACG and expect to drill 13 gross
    wells in 2007.

China

— Our production in China is from the
    Panyu field in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China
    Sea. Panyu produces oil from conventional reservoirs. In
    addition to Panyu, which is located on block 15/34, we also
    hold leases in two exploratory blocks offshore China. In total,
    we have 4.4 million net acres under lease in China. We have
    a 24.5% working interest at Panyu and 100% working interests in
    the exploratory blocks. We drilled six gross wells in China in
    2006, all in the Panyu field. In 2007, we expect to drill seven
    gross wells in the Panyu field.

Brazil

— We expect to commence oil production
    in Brazil in 2007 from our Polvo field. Polvo, which we operate
    with a 60% interest, is located offshore in block BM-C-8. In
    addition to our development project at Polvo, we also hold
    acreage in nine exploratory blocks. In aggregate, we have
    835,000 net acres in Brazil. Our working interests range
    from 18% to 100% in these blocks. We drilled three gross wells
    in Brazil in 2006 and plan to drill 11 gross wells in
    Brazil in 2007.

Equatorial Guinea

— All of our oil production
    from the West African country of Equatorial Guinea is from the
    offshore Zafiro field in the Gulf of Guinea. Zafiro is located
    on block B, and we also have interests in three additional
    exploratory blocks. We hold 518,000 net acres in the four
    blocks combined. Zafiro produces crude oil from conventional
    reservoirs. Our working interests (participating interests under
    the terms of the production sharing contracts) range from 24% to
    38% in the four blocks. In 2006, we drilled 10 gross wells
    in Equatorial Guinea, all in the Zafiro field. In 2007, we plan
    to drill 10 gross wells in Equatorial Guinea. Equatorial
    Guinea is included in the West African assets we intend to sell
    during 2007.

Title to
    Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
    customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
    not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We
    believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the
    value of such properties or from the respective interests
    therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
    of the business.



As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
    of local records, little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
    Investigations, generally including a title opinion of outside
    counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of
    producing properties and before commencement of drilling
    operations on undeveloped properties.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
    have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
    federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
    and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and
    sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The
    principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is United States ex
    rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. (the
    “Wright case”). The suit was originally filed in
    August 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
    District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000 with the
    other suits for pre-trial proceedings in the United States
    District Court for the District of Wyoming. On July 10,
    2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to
    the Eastern District of Texas to resume proceedings. On
    February 1, 2006, the Court entered a scheduling order in
    which trial is set for November 2007. We believe we have acted
    reasonably, have legitimate and strong defenses to all
    allegations in the suit, and have paid royalties in good faith.
    We do not currently believe that we are subject to material
    exposure in association with this lawsuit and no related
    liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial
    statements.

Equatorial
    Guinea Investigation

The SEC has been conducting an inquiry into payments made to the
    government of Equatorial Guinea and to officials and persons
    affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial
    Guinea. On August 9, 2005, we received a subpoena issued by
    the SEC pursuant to a formal order of investigation. We have
    cooperated fully with the SEC’s requests for information in
    this inquiry. After responding in 2005 to such requests for
    information, we have not been contacted by the SEC. In the event
    that we receive any further inquiries, we will work with the SEC
    in connection with its investigation.

Other
    Matters

We are involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the
    date of this report, there were no other material pending legal
    proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our
    property is subject.

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders
    during the fourth quarter of 2006.

We began paying regular quarterly cash dividends on our common
    stock in the second quarter of 1993. We anticipate continuing to
    pay regular quarterly dividends in the foreseeable future.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

On August 3, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors
    had authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of
    our common stock. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2006,
    43.5 million shares remain available for purchase under
    this program. We suspended this stock repurchase program during
    the second quarter of 2006 in conjunction with our acquisition
    of Chief. In conjunction with the sales of our Egyptian and West
    African assets in 2007, we expect to resume this program in late
    2007 by using a portion of the sale proceeds to repurchase
    common stock. Although this program expires at the end of 2007,
    it could be extended if necessary.

For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed
    charges and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and
    preferred stock dividends, (i) earnings consist of earnings
    from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed
    charges; (ii) fixed charges consist of interest expense,
    dividends on subsidiary’s preferred stock, distributions on
    preferred securities of subsidiary trust, amortization of costs
    relating to indebtedness and the preferred securities of
    subsidiary trust, and one-third of rental expense estimated to
    be attributable to interest; and (iii) preferred stock
    dividends consist of the amount of pre-tax earnings required to
    pay dividends on the outstanding preferred stock. For the year
    2002, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by
    $135 million, and were insufficient to cover combined fixed
    charges and preferred stock dividends by $151 million.

Gas volumes are converted to Boe at the rate of six Mcf of gas
    per barrel of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy
    content of natural gas and oil, which rate is not necessarily
    indicative of the relationship of oil and gas prices. NGL
    volumes are converted to Boe on a

one-to-one

basis with oil. The respective prices of oil, gas and NGLs are
    affected by market and other factors in addition to relative
    energy content.

Overview
    of Business

Devon is one of the largest U.S. based independent oil and
    gas producers and processors of natural gas and natural gas
    liquids in North America. Our portfolio of oil and gas
    properties provides stable production and a platform for future
    growth. About 90 percent of our production is from North
    America. We also operate in selected international areas,
    including Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. Our production mix is
    about 65 percent natural gas and 35 percent oil and
    natural gas liquids such as propane, butane and ethane. We are
    currently producing about 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural
    gas each day, or about 3 percent of all the gas consumed in
    North America.

In managing our global operations, we have an operating strategy
    that is focused on creating and increasing value per share. Key
    elements of this strategy are replacing oil and gas reserves,
    growing production and exercising capital discipline. We must
    also control operating costs and manage commodity pricing risks
    to achieve long-term success. The discussion and analysis of our
    results of operations and other related information will refer
    to these factors.

•

Oil and gas reserve replacement

— Our financial
    condition and profitability are significantly affected by the
    amount of proved reserves we own. Oil and gas properties are our
    most significant asset, and the reserves that relate to such
    properties are key to our future success. To increase our proved
    reserves, we must replace reserves that have been produced with
    additional reserves from successful exploration and development
    activities or property acquisitions.

•

Production growth

— Our profitability and
    operating cash flows are largely dependent on the amount of oil,
    gas and NGLs we produce. Furthermore, growing production from
    existing properties is difficult because the rate of production
    from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are
    depleted.



As a result, we constantly drill for new proved reserves and
    develop proved undeveloped reserves on properties that provide a
    balance of near-term and long-term production. In addition, we
    may acquire properties with proved reserves that we can develop
    and subsequently produce to help us meet our production goals.

•

Capital investment discipline

— Effectively
    deploying our resources into capital projects is key to
    maintaining and growing future production and oil and gas
    reserves. Therefore, maintaining a disciplined approach to
    investing in capital projects is important to our profitability
    and financial condition. Also, our ability to control capital
    expenditures can be affected by changes in commodity prices.
    During times of high commodity prices, drilling and related
    costs often escalate due to the effects of supply versus demand
    economics. Approximately 82% of our planned 2007 investment in
    capital projects is dedicated to a foundation of low-risk
    projects primarily in North America. The remainder of our
    capital is invested in high-impact projects primarily in the
    Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and China. By deploying our capital in
    this manner, we are able to consistently deliver cost-efficient
    drill-bit growth and provide a strong source of cash flow while
    balancing short-term and long-term growth targets.

•

Operating cost controls

— To maintain our
    competitive position, we must control our lease operating costs
    and other production costs. As reservoirs are depleted and
    production rates decline, per unit production costs will
    generally increase and affect our profitability and operating
    cash flows. Similar to capital expenditures, our ability to
    control operating costs can be affected when commodity prices
    rise significantly. Our base North American production is
    focused in core areas of our operations where we can achieve
    economies of scale to assist our management of operating costs.

•

Commodity pricing risks

— Our profitability is
    highly dependent on the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs.
    Prices for oil, gas and NGLs are determined primarily by market
    conditions. Market conditions for these products have been, and
    will continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide
    economic activity, weather and other factors that are beyond our
    control. To manage this volatility in the past, we have utilized
    financial hedging arrangements and fixed-price contracts on a
    portion of our production and may use such instruments in the
    future.

Overview
    of 2006 Results and Outlook

2006 was one of the best years in Devon’s history. We
    achieved key operational successes and continued to execute our
    strategy to increase value per share. As a result, we delivered
    record amounts for earnings per share and operating cash flow
    and grew proved reserves to a new all-time high. Key measures of
    our financial and operating performance for 2006, as well as
    certain operational developments, are summarized below:

•

Net earnings declined 3% from $2.9 billion to
    $2.8 billion

•

Diluted net earnings per share increased 1% to $6.34 per
    diluted share

•

Net cash provided by operating activities reached
    $6.0 billion

•

Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2006 reached a
    record amount of 2.4 billion Boe

•

Estimated proved reserves increased 533 million Boe through
    drilling, extensions, performance revisions and acquisitions

•

Capital expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development
    activities were $7.7 billion, including the
    $2.2 billion acquisition of Chief

•

Combined realized price for oil, gas and NGLs per Boe increased
    5% to $41.51

•

Marketing and midstream margin remained flat at
    $448 million for 2006

We produced 214 million Boe in 2006, representing a 4%
    decrease compared to 2005. Excluding the effects of production
    lost due to the sale of non-core properties in the first half of
    2005, our

year-over-year

production remained constant. Operating costs increased due to
    inflationary pressure driven by the effects of



higher commodity prices and due to the weakened U.S. dollar
    compared to the Canadian dollar. Per unit lease operating
    expenses increased 17% to $6.95 per Boe.

During 2006, we utilized cash on hand, cash flow from
    operations, and $1.8 billion of commercial paper borrowings
    to fund our capital expenditures, repay $862 million in
    debt and repurchase $253 million of our common stock. We
    ended the year with $1.3 billion of cash and short-term
    investments.

From an operational perspective, our deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    exploration program has reached several important milestones
    related to the Lower Tertiary trend. To date, we have drilled
    four discovery wells in the Lower Tertiary — Cascade
    in 2002, St. Malo in 2003, Jack in 2004 and Kaskida in the third
    quarter of 2006. Also in the third quarter of 2006, we announced
    the successful production test of the Jack No. 2 well in
    the Lower Tertiary. We currently hold 273 blocks in the Lower
    Tertiary and have identified 19 additional exploratory prospects
    within these blocks to date. These achievements support our
    positive view of the Lower Tertiary and demonstrate the growth
    potential of our high-impact exploration strategy on long-term
    production, reserves and value.

On June 29, 2006, we acquired Chief’s oil and gas
    assets located in the Barnett Shale area of Texas for
    $2.2 billion. This transaction added 99.7 million Boe
    of proved reserves and 169,000 net acres to our Barnett
    Shale assets. This acquisition combined with our organic growth
    continues to extend our leadership position in the Barnett Shale
    and provides years of additional drilling inventory.

On November 14, 2006, we announced our plans to divest our
    operations in Egypt. At December 31, 2006, Egypt had proved
    reserves of eight million Boe. Subsequently, on January 23,
    2007, we announced our plans to divest our operations in West
    Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, and
    other countries in the region. At December 31, 2006, our
    West Africa operations had proved reserves of 90 million
    Boe, or 4% of total proved reserves. We anticipate completing
    the sale of our Egyptian assets in the first half of 2007 and
    our West African assets in the third quarter of 2007. Divesting
    these properties will allow us to redeploy our financial and
    intellectual capital to the significant growth opportunities we
    have developed onshore in North America and in the deepwater
    Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we will sharpen our focus in North
    America and concentrate our international operations in Brazil
    and China, where we have established competitive advantages.

Looking to 2007, we intend to use the proceeds from the sales of
    our operations in Egypt and West Africa to repay our outstanding
    commercial paper and resume common stock repurchases. In
    addition, our operational accomplishments to date have laid the
    foundation for continued growth in future years, at competitive
    unit costs, that we expect will continue to create additional
    value for our investors. In 2007, we expect to deliver reserve
    additions of 350 to 370 million Boe with related capital
    expenditures in the range of $5.3 to $5.7 billion. We
    expect production related to our continuing operations to
    increase approximately 10% from 2006 to 2007, which reflects the
    significant reserve additions in 2005 and 2006, and those
    expected in 2007.

Oil
    Revenues

2006 vs. 2005

Oil revenues decreased $270 million
    due to a seven million barrel decrease in production. Production
    lost from properties divested in 2005 accounted for four million
    barrels of the decrease. A contractual reduction of our share of
    production from one of our international properties in mid-2005
    also lowered 2006 volumes. These decreases were partially offset
    by a three million barrel increase in production resulting from
    reaching payout of certain carried interests in Azerbaijan.

Oil revenues increased $1.1 billion as a result of a 53%
    increase in our realized price. The expiration of oil hedges at
    the end of 2005 and a 17% increase in the average NYMEX West
    Texas Intermediate index price caused the increase in our
    realized oil price.

2005 vs. 2004

Oil revenues decreased $347 million
    due to a 12 million barrel decrease in production.
    Production lost from the 2005 property divestitures accounted
    for seven million barrels of the decrease. We also suspended
    certain domestic production in 2005 and 2004 due to the effects
    of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Dennis and Ivan. The volumes
    suspended in 2005 were one million barrels more than in 2004.
    The remainder of the decrease is due to certain international
    properties in which our ownership interest decreased after we
    recovered our costs under the applicable production sharing
    contracts.

Higher realized prices caused oil revenues to increase
    $607 million in 2005. Our 2005 oil prices rose primarily
    due to a 37% increase in the average NYMEX West Texas
    Intermediate index price.

Gas
    Revenues

2006 vs. 2005

A 12 Bcf decrease in production caused
    gas revenues to decrease by $86 million. Production lost
    from the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease of
    35 Bcf. As a result of the previously mentioned hurricanes,
    gas volumes suspended in 2006 were three Bcf more than those
    suspended in 2005. These decreases were partially offset by the
    June 2006 Chief acquisition, which contributed 10 Bcf of
    production during the last half of 2006, and additional
    production from new drilling and development in our
    U.S. onshore and offshore properties.



A 13% decline in average prices caused gas revenues to decrease
    $766 million in 2006.

2005 vs. 2004

A 64 Bcf decrease in production caused
    gas revenues to decrease by $337 million. Production
    associated with the 2005 property divestitures caused a decrease
    of 89 Bcf. We also suspended certain domestic gas
    production in 2005 and 2004 due to the previously mentioned
    hurricanes. The volumes suspended in 2005 were 12 Bcf more
    than in 2004. These decreases were partially offset by new
    drilling and development and increased performance in
    U.S. onshore and offshore properties.

A 32% increase in average gas prices contributed
    $1.4 billion of additional revenues in 2005.

Marketing
    and Midstream Revenues and Operating Costs and
    Expenses

The following table details the changes in our marketing and
    midstream revenues and operating costs and expenses between 2004
    and 2006. The changes due to prices in the table represent the

2006 vs. 2005

Volume increases in our gas pipeline, gas

    expenses to increase in 2006. This additional activity was
    primarily due to our continued growth in the Barnett Shale and
    higher natural gas deliveries from third-party producers.

2005 vs. 2004

Volume decreases in 2005 caused both
    revenues and expenses to decline in 2005. The lower activity was
    primarily attributable to the sale of certain non-core assets in
    2004 and 2005.

2006 vs. 2005

Lease operating expenses increased
    $164 million in 2006 largely due to higher commodity
    prices. Commodity price increases in 2005 and the first half of
    2006 contributed to industry-wide inflationary pressures on
    materials and personnel costs. Additionally, consideration of
    higher commodity prices contributed to our decision to perform
    more well workovers and maintenance projects to maintain or
    improve production volumes. Commodity price increases also
    caused operating costs such as ad valorem taxes, power and fuel
    costs to rise.

A higher

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate in 2006 caused a $34 million increase in our
    costs. Lease operating expenses also increased $33 million
    due to the June 2006 Chief acquisition and the payouts of our
    carried interests in Azerbaijan in the last half of 2006. The
    increases in our lease operating expenses were partially offset
    by a decrease of $82 million related to properties that
    were sold in 2005.

The factors described above were also the primary factors
    causing lease operating expenses per Boe to increase during
    2006. Although we divested properties in 2005 that had higher

per-unit

operating costs, the cost escalation largely related to higher
    commodity prices and the weaker U.S. dollar had a greater
    effect on our per unit costs than the property divestitures.

2005 vs. 2004

Lease operating expenses increased
    $65 million in 2005 largely due to higher commodity prices.
    As addressed above, commodity price increases led to overall
    industry inflation. Additionally, a higher

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate in 2005 caused a $30 million increase in
    2005. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of
    $144 million in lease operating expenses related to
    properties that were sold in 2005.

The increases described above were also the primary factors
    causing lease operating expenses per Boe to increase. Although
    we divested properties that had higher

per-unit

operating costs, the cost escalation largely related to higher
    commodity prices and the weaker U.S. dollar had a greater
    effect on our per unit costs than the property divestitures.

The following table details the changes in production taxes
    between 2004 and 2006. The majority of our production taxes are
    assessed on our onshore domestic properties. In the U.S., most
    of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of
    revenues. Therefore, the changes due to revenues in the table
    primarily relate to changes in oil, gas and NGL revenues from
    our U.S. onshore properties.

2006 vs. 2005

Production taxes increased $29 million

    A new Chinese “Special Petroleum Gain” tax was the
    primary contributor to the higher rate.

2005 vs. 2004

Production taxes increased $30 million
    due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2005.
    An increase in Russian export tax rates was the primary
    contributor to the higher rate.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties
    (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying
    the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during
    the year, by the “depletable base.” The depletable
    base represents the net capitalized investment plus future
    development costs in those reserves. Generally, if reserve
    volumes are revised up or down, then the DD&A rate per unit
    of production will change inversely. However, if the depletable
    base changes, then the DD&A rate moves in the same
    direction. The per unit DD&A rate is not affected by



production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A, as opposed to
    the rate per unit of production, generally moves in the same
    direction as production volumes. Oil and gas property DD&A
    is calculated separately on a

country-by-country

basis.

The following table details the changes in DD&A of oil and
    gas properties between 2004 and 2006. The changes due to volumes
    in the table represent the effect on DD&A due to decreases
    in combined oil, gas and NGL production.

2006 vs. 2005

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    increased $370 million in 2006 due to an increase in the
    DD&A rate from $8.86 per Boe in 2005 to $10.59 per Boe
    in 2006. The largest contributor to the rate increase was
    inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2006 as
    well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future
    periods on proved undeveloped reserves. Other factors
    contributing to the rate increase include the June 2006 Chief
    acquisition and the transfer of previously unproved costs to the
    depletable base as a result of 2006 drilling activities. A
    reduction in reserve estimates due to the effects of
    2006 year-end commodity prices also contributed to the rate
    increase.

2005 vs. 2004

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    increased $99 million in 2005 due to an increase in the
    DD&A rate from $8.41 per Boe in 2004 to $8.86 per Boe
    in 2005. The largest contributor to the rate increase was the
    effect of inflationary pressure on finding and development costs
    for reserve discoveries and extensions. Changes in the

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate also caused the rate to increase. These increases
    were partially offset by a decrease in the rate as a result of
    our 2005 property divestitures.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our net G&A consists of three primary
    components.  The largest of these components is the
    gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs, office
    expenses, professional fees and other G&A items. The gross
    amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting
    components. One is the amount of G&A capitalized pursuant to
    the full cost method of accounting related to exploration and
    development activities. The other is the amount of G&A
    reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which we
    serve as the operator. These reimbursements are received during
    both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s
    life. The gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts
    capitalized and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Net G&A includes
    expenses related to oil, gas and NGL exploration and production
    activities, as well as marketing and midstream activities. See
    the following table for a summary of G&A expenses by
    component.

2006 vs. 2005

Gross G&A increased $192 million.
    Higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross
    G&A to increase $149 million. Of this increase,
    $34 million represented stock option expense recognized
    pursuant to our adoption in 2006 of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment.

An additional $28 million of the increase related to higher
    restricted stock compensation. In addition, changes in the

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate caused a $11 million increase in costs.

2005 vs. 2004

Gross G&A increased $32 million.
    Higher employee compensation and benefits costs caused gross
    G&A to increase $35 million. Of this increase,
    $17 million related to higher restricted stock
    compensation. In addition, changes in the

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate caused a $9 million increase in costs. These
    increases were partially offset by an $8 million decrease
    in rent expense resulting primarily from the abandonment of
    certain Canadian office space in 2004.

The factors discussed above were also the primary factors that
    caused the $88 million and $15 million increases in
    capitalized G&A in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Interest based on debt outstanding decreased from 2004 to 2006
    primarily due to the net effect of debt repayments during 2005
    and 2006. This was partially offset by the effect of increased
    commercial paper borrowings during the last half of 2006 related
    to the acquisition of the Chief properties.

During 2005, we redeemed our $400 million 6.75% notes
    due March 15, 2011 and our zero coupon convertible senior
    debentures prior to their scheduled maturity dates. The other
    interest category in the table above includes $81 million
    in 2005 related to these early retirements.

During 2004, we repaid the balance under our $3 billion
    term loan credit facility prior to the scheduled repayment date.
    The other interest category in the table above includes
    $16 million in 2004 related to this early repayment.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2006 and 2005, we reduced the carrying value of certain
    of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities. A detailed
    description of how full cost ceiling limitations are determined
    is included in the “Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates” section of this report. A summary of these
    reductions and additional discussion is provided below.

    Reductions

We have committed to drill four wells in Nigeria. The first two
    wells were unsuccessful. After drilling the second unsuccessful
    well in the first quarter of 2006, we determined that the
    capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired.
    Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, we recognized an
    $85 million impairment of our investment in Nigeria equal
    to the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate
    share of block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related
    to this impairment.

During the second quarter of 2006, we drilled two unsuccessful
    exploratory wells in Brazil and determined that the capitalized
    costs related to these two wells should be impaired. Therefore,
    in the second quarter of 2006, we recognized a $16 million
    impairment of our investment in Brazil equal to the costs to
    drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of
    block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related to this
    impairment. The two wells were unrelated to Devon’s Polvo
    development project in Brazil.

As a result of a decline in projected future net cash flows, the
    carrying value of our Russian properties exceeded the full cost
    ceiling by $10 million at the end of the third quarter of
    2006. Therefore, we recognized a $20 million reduction of
    the carrying value of our oil and gas properties in Russia,
    offset by a $10 million deferred income tax benefit.

    Reductions

Our interests in Angola were acquired through the 2003 Ocean
    Energy merger. Our Angolan drilling program discovered no proven
    reserves. After drilling three unsuccessful wells in the fourth
    quarter of 2005, we determined that all of the Angolan
    capitalized costs should be impaired.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, we were capitalizing the
    costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in Brazil pending the
    determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in
    Brazil. We have been successful in our drilling efforts on block
    BM-C-8 in Brazil and are currently developing the Polvo project
    on this block. The ultimate value of the Polvo project is
    expected to be in excess of the sum of its related costs, plus
    the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts in
    Brazil which were capitalized. However, the Polvo proved
    reserves will be recorded over a period of time. At the end of
    2005, it was expected that a small initial portion of the proved
    reserves ultimately expected at Polvo would be recorded in 2006.
    Based on preliminary estimates developed in the fourth quarter
    of 2005, the value of this initial partial booking of proved
    reserves was not sufficient to offset the sum of the related
    proportionate Polvo costs plus the costs of the previous
    unrelated unsuccessful efforts. Therefore, we determined that
    the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to the Polvo project
    should be impaired. These costs totaled approximately
    $42 million. There was no tax benefit related to this
    Brazilian impairment.

The change in the fair value of the embedded option relates to

    common stock. These expenses were caused primarily by increases
    in the price of Chevron Corporation’s common stock.

In 2005, we recognized a $39 million loss on certain oil
    derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified for
    hedge accounting because the hedged production exceeded actual
    and projected production under these contracts. The lower than
    expected production was caused primarily by hurricanes that
    affected offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.

Interest and dividend income increased from 2004 to 2005
    primarily due to an increase in cash and short-term investment
    balances and higher interest rates.

During 2005, we sold certain non-core midstream assets for a net
    gain of $150 million. Also during 2005, we incurred a
    $55 million loss on certain commodity hedges that no longer
    qualified for hedge accounting and were settled prior to the end
    of their original term. These hedges related to U.S. and
    Canadian oil production from properties sold as part of our 2005
    property divestiture program. This loss was partially offset by
    a $7 million gain related to interest rate swaps that were
    settled prior to the end of their original term in conjunction
    with the early redemption of the $400 million
    6.75% senior notes in 2005.

The gains in 2005 and 2004 from changes in foreign exchange
    rates were primarily related to $400 million of Canadian
    subsidiary debt that was denominated in U.S. dollars. The
    debt was retired in 2005.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred income taxes were reduced
    $243 million, $14 million and $36 million,
    respectively, due to Canadian statutory rate reductions that
    were enacted in each such year.

In 2006, deferred income taxes increased $39 million due to
    the effect of a new income-based tax enacted by the state of
    Texas that replaces a previous franchise tax. The new tax is
    effective January 1, 2007.

In 2006 and 2005, income taxes were reduced $12 million and
    $25 million, respectively, due to a new U.S. tax
    deduction for companies with domestic production activities,
    including oil and gas extraction.

In 2005, we recognized $28 million of taxes related to our
    repatriation of $545 million to the U.S. The cash was
    repatriated due to tax legislation that allowed qualifying
    companies to repatriate cash from foreign operations at a
    reduced income tax rate. Substantially all of the cash
    repatriated by us in 2005 related to earnings of our Canadian
    subsidiary.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

On November 14, 2006, we announced our plans to divest our
    operations in Egypt. We anticipate completing the sale of our
    Egyptian operations in the first half of 2007. Pursuant to
    accounting rules for discontinued operations, Egypt is
    considered a discontinued operation at the end of 2006. As a
    result, the Egypt financial results for 2006 and all prior

Operating
    Cash Flow — Continuing Operations

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flow”) is our primary source of capital and liquidity.
    Changes in operating cash flow are largely due to the same
    factors that affect our net earnings, with the exception of
    those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses as DD&A,
    property impairments, derivative fair value changes and deferred
    income tax expense. As a result, our operating cash flow
    increased in 2006 and 2005 compared to the previous years
    largely due to increases in net earnings, as discussed in the
    “Results of Operations” section of this report.

Sales of
    Property and Equipment

In 2005, we generated $2.2 billion in pre-tax proceeds from
    sales of property and equipment. These consisted of
    $2.0 billion related to the sale of non-core oil and gas
    properties and $0.2 billion related to the sale of non-core
    midstream assets. Net of related income taxes, these proceeds
    were $1.8 billion for oil and gas properties and
    $0.1 billion for midstream assets.



Net
    Commercial Paper Borrowings

On June 29, 2006, we acquired Chief for $2 billion of
    cash and the assumption of $0.2 billion of liabilities. We
    funded a portion of the purchase price with $1.4 billion of
    borrowings issued under our commercial paper program. As a
    result of the Chief acquisition and success in other onshore
    U.S. locations, we accelerated certain oil and gas
    development activities into the last half of 2006. We borrowed
    an additional $0.4 billion of commercial paper to fund this
    accelerated development.

Capital
    Expenditures

The increases in operating cash flow have enabled us to invest
    larger amounts in capital projects. As a result, excluding the
    acquisition of the Chief properties, our capital expenditures
    increased 38% in 2006. The majority of this increase related to
    our expenditures for the acquisition, drilling or development of
    oil and gas properties, which totaled $5.0 billion in 2006,
    excluding the Chief acquisition. Inflationary pressure driven by
    higher commodity prices and increased drilling activities in the
    Barnett Shale, Gulf of Mexico, Carthage and Groesbeck areas of
    the U.S. contributed to the increase. In addition, the
    payouts of our carried interests in Azerbaijan in the last half
    of 2006 and the weaker U.S. dollar impact on our Canadian
    operations also contributed to the increase.

Capital expenditures in 2005 increased 32% compared to 2004
    primarily due to an increase in our expenditures for the
    acquisition, drilling or development of oil and gas properties,
    which totaled $3.9 billion in 2005. Increased drilling
    activities in the Barnett Shale, the approximately
    $200 million acquisition of Iron River acreage in Canada
    and the $74 million purchase of the Serpentina FPSO in
    offshore Equatorial Guinea were large contributors to the
    increase. Inflationary pressure driven by higher commodity
    prices and the weaker U.S. dollar also caused our
    expenditures to increase from 2004 to 2005.

Debt
    Repayments

Our net debt retirements were $0.9 billion,
    $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. These amounts consisted of payments at the
    scheduled maturity dates with the exception of the following
    payments. The 2006 amount includes $0.2 billion related to
    the repayment of debt acquired in the Chief acquisition. The
    2005 amount includes $0.8 billion related to the retirement
    of zero coupon convertible debentures due in 2020 and
    6.75% notes due in 2011. The 2004 amount includes
    $635 million for the payment of the outstanding balance
    under a $3 billion term loan credit facility due in 2006.

Repurchases
    of Common Stock

In August 2005, we completed a share repurchase program that
    began in October 2004. Under this program, we repurchased
    49.6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of
    $2.3 billion, or $46.69 per share. In August 2005, we
    announced another program to repurchase up to an additional
    50 million shares of our common stock. During 2005 and
    2006, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for
    $387 million, or $59.80 per share, under this program.

Dividends

Our common stock dividends were $199 million,
    $136 million and $97 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. We also paid $10 million of preferred stock
    dividends in 2006, 2005 and 2004. The 2006 and 2005 increases in
    common stock dividends were primarily related to a 50% increase
    in the dividend rate in the first quarter of both 2006 and 2005,
    partially offset by a decrease in outstanding shares due to
    share repurchases.

Changes
    in Short-Term Investments

To maximize our income on available cash balances, we invest in
    highly liquid, short-term investments. The purchase and sale of
    these short-term investments will cause cash and cash
    equivalents to decrease and



increase, respectively. Short-term investment balances decreased
    $106 million and $287 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and increased $626 million in 2004.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has
    been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain a revolving
    line of credit and a commercial paper program which can be
    accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other
    available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance
    of equity securities and long-term debt. During 2007, another
    major source of liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our
    operations in Egypt and West Africa. We expect the combination
    of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund
    future capital expenditures, debt repayments, common stock
    repurchases, and other contractual commitments as discussed
    later in this section.

Operating
    Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow has increased nearly 25% since 2004,
    reaching a total of $5.9 billion in 2006. We expect
    operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of
    liquidity. Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many
    variables, the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil,
    natural gas and NGLs produced. Prices for these commodities are
    determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional
    and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially
    variable factors influence market conditions for these products.
    These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to
    predict.

We periodically believe it appropriate to mitigate some of the
    risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices. We have used a
    variety of avenues to achieve this partial risk mitigation. We
    have utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on
    a portion of our production. We have also utilized various price
    swap contracts and fixed-price physical delivery contracts to
    fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and
    natural gas production. Based on contracts currently in place,
    approximately 5% of our estimated 2007 natural gas production
    (3% of our total Boe production) is subject to either price
    collars, swaps or fixed-price contracts.

Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through
    an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity
    price increases, as experienced in recent years, can lead to an
    increase in drilling and development activities. As a result,
    the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and
    materials may also increase, causing a negative impact on our
    cash flow.

Credit
    Lines

Another source of liquidity is our $2.5 billion five-year,
    syndicated, unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Senior
    Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes a
    five-year revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million. Amounts borrowed under the Senior
    Credit Facility may, at our election, bear interest at various
    fixed rate options for periods of up to twelve months. Such
    rates are generally less than the prime rate. However, we may
    elect to borrow at the prime rate. As of December 31, 2006,
    there were no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. The
    available capacity under the Senior Credit Facility as of
    December 31, 2006, net of $1.8 billion of outstanding
    commercial paper and $284 million of outstanding letters of
    credit, was approximately $408 million.

The Senior Credit Facility matures on April 7, 2011, and
    all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time
    unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, we have the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. We are working to obtain lender approval to
    extend the current maturity date of April 7, 2011 to
    April 7, 2012. If successful, this maturity date extension
    will be effective April 7, 2007, provided we have not
    experienced a “material adverse effect,” as defined in
    the Senior Credit Facility agreement, at that date.

The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial
    covenant. This covenant requires our ratio of total funded debt
    to total capitalization to be less than 65%. The credit
    agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total
    capitalization that include adjustments to the respective
    amounts reported in our



consolidated financial statements. As defined in the agreement,
    total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable
    into shares of Chevron Corporation common stock. Also, total
    capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial
    writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill
    impairments. As of December 31, 2006, our debt to
    capitalization ratio as calculated pursuant to this covenant was
    27.3%.

Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility is not
    restricted under any “material adverse effect”
    clauses. It is not uncommon for credit agreements to include
    such clauses. These clauses can remove the obligation of the
    banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would
    reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on
    the borrower’s financial condition, operations, properties
    or business considered as a whole, the borrower’s ability
    to make timely debt payments, or the enforceability of material
    terms of the credit agreement. While our Senior Credit Facility
    includes covenants that require us to report a condition or
    event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the
    banks to fund the Senior Credit Facility is not conditioned on
    the absence of a material adverse effect.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $2 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    seven and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index
    such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate
    as found on the commercial paper market. As of December 31,
    2006, we had $1.8 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at an average rate of 5.37%.

Debt
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the
    United States. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies
    consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
    levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
    commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
    agencies. Our current debt ratings are BBB with a positive
    outlook by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 with a positive
    outlook by Moody’s and BBB with a positive outlook by Fitch.

There are no “rating triggers” in any of our
    contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled
    maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level.
    Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility is
    predicated on our corporate debt rating. Therefore, even though
    a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities,
    it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings
    under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Senior
    Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the
    fully-drawn borrowing costs for the Senior Credit Facility from
    LIBOR plus 45 basis points to a new rate of LIBOR plus
    65 basis points. A ratings downgrade could also adversely
    impact our ability to economically access debt markets in the
    future. As of December 31, 2006, we were not aware of any
    potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating
    agencies.

Capital
    Expenditures

In February 2007, we provided guidance for our 2007 capital
    expenditures which are expected to range from $5.7 billion
    to $6.2 billion. This represents the largest planned use of
    our 2007 operating cash flow, with the high end of the range
    being 11% higher than our 2006 capital expenditures, excluding
    the Chief acquisition. To a certain degree, the ultimate timing
    of these capital expenditures is within our control. Therefore,
    if oil and natural gas prices fluctuate from current estimates,
    we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2007 capital
    expenditures until later periods, or accelerate capital
    expenditures planned for periods beyond 2007 to achieve the
    desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity. Based
    upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2007, we
    anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our 2007
    capital expenditures.



Common
    Stock Repurchase Program

In August 2005, we announced a program to repurchase up to
    50 million shares of our common stock. We had repurchased
    6.5 million shares under this program through the middle of
    2006 when the program was suspended as a result of the Chief
    acquisition. In conjunction with the sales of our Egyptian and
    West African operations, we expect to resume this repurchase
    program in late 2007 by using a portion of the sales proceeds to
    repurchase common stock. Although this program expires at the
    end of 2007, it could be extended if necessary.

Long-term debt amounts represent scheduled maturities of our
    debt obligations at December 31, 2006, excluding
    $5 million of fair value adjustments and $8 million of
    net premiums included in the carrying value of debt. The
    “Less than 1 Year” amount includes
    $1.8 billion of short-term commercial paper borrowings. We
    intend to use the proceeds from the sales of our Egyptian and
    West African assets to repay our outstanding commercial paper.
    The “1-3 Years” amount includes $760 million
    related to our debentures exchangeable into shares of Chevron
    Corporation common stock. As of December 31, 2006, we
    beneficially owned approximately 14.2 million shares of
    Chevron common stock for possible exchange for the exchangeable
    debentures. In addition, $284 million of letters of credit
    that have been issued by commercial banks on our behalf are
    excluded from the table. The majority of these letters of
    credit, if funded, would become borrowings under our revolving
    credit facility. Most of these letters of credit have been
    granted by financial institutions to support our international
    and Canadian drilling commitments.

(2)

Interest expense amounts represent the scheduled fixed-rate and
    variable-rate cash payments related to our debt. Interest on our
    variable-rate debt was estimated based upon expected future
    interest rates as of December 31, 2006.

(3)

Drilling and facility obligations represent contractual
    agreements with third party service providers to procure
    drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and
    exploratory drilling and facilities construction. Included in
    the $3.0 billion total is $1.9 billion which relates
    to long-term contracts for three deepwater drilling rigs and
    certain other contracts for onshore drilling and facility
    obligations in which drilling or facilities construction has not
    commenced. The $1.9 billion represents the gross commitment
    under these contracts. Our ultimate payment for these
    commitments will be reduced by the amounts billed to our working
    interest partners. Payments for these commitments, net of
    amounts billed to partners, will be capitalized as a component
    of oil and gas properties.

(4)

Asset retirement obligations represent estimated discounted
    costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation
    costs. These obligations are recorded as liabilities on our
    December 31, 2006 balance sheet.



(5)

Firm transportation agreements represent “ship or pay”
    arrangements whereby we have committed to ship certain volumes
    of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed transportation fee. We have
    entered into these agreements to aid the movement of our
    production to market. We expect to have sufficient production to
    utilize the majority of these transportation services.

(6)

Lease obligations consist of operating leases for office space
    and equipment, an offshore platform spar and FPSO’s. Office
    and equipment leases represent non-cancelable leases for office
    space and equipment used in our daily operations.

We have an offshore platform spar that is being used in the
    development of the Nansen field in the Gulf of Mexico. This spar
    is subject to a

20-year

lease and contains various options whereby we may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spars. We have guaranteed that
    the spar will have a residual value at the end of the term equal
    to at least 10% of the fair value of the spar at the inception
    of the lease. The total guaranteed value is $14 million in
    2022. However, such amount may be reduced under the terms of the
    lease agreements. In 2005, we sold our interests in the Boomvang
    field in the Gulf of Mexico, which has a spar lease with terms
    similar to those of the Nansen lease. As a result of the sale,
    we are subleasing the Boomvang Spar. The table above does not
    include any amounts related to the Boomvang spar lease. However,
    if the sublessee were to default on its obligation, we would
    continue to be obligated to pay the periodic lease payments and
    any guaranteed value required at the end of the term.

We also lease two FPSO’s that are being used in the Panyu
    project offshore China and the Polvo project offshore Brazil.
    The Panyu FPSO lease term expires in September 2009. The Polvo
    FPSO lease term expires in 2014.

Pension
    Funding and Estimates

Funded Status.

As compared to the
    “projected benefit obligation,” our qualified and
    nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by
    $178 million and $133 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. A detailed reconciliation of the
    2006 changes to our underfunded status is included in
    Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements. Of the $178 million underfunded status at the
    end of 2006, $156 million is attributable to various
    nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan assets.
    However, we have established certain trusts to fund the benefit
    obligations of such nonqualified plans. As of December 31,
    2006, these trusts had investments with a fair value of
    $59 million. The value of these trusts is included in
    noncurrent other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

As compared to the “accumulated benefit obligation,”
    our qualified defined benefit plans were overfunded by
    $59 million at December 31, 2006. The accumulated
    benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation
    in that the former includes no assumption about future
    compensation levels. Our current intentions are to provide
    sufficient funding in future years to ensure the accumulated
    benefit obligation remains fully funded. The actual amount of
    contributions required during this period will depend on
    investment returns from the plan assets. Required contributions
    also depend upon changes in actuarial assumptions made during
    the same period, particularly the discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit
    obligation. For 2007, we anticipate the accumulated benefit
    obligation will remain fully funded without contributing to our
    defined benefit plans. Therefore, we don’t expect to
    contribute to the plans during 2007.

Pension Estimate Assumptions.

Our pension
    expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’
    approximate service periods and is generally calculated
    independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized
    expense for our defined benefit pension plans of
    $31 million, $26 million and $26 million in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. We estimate that our pension
    expense will approximate $43 million in 2007.

The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
    requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
    assumptions can result in different expense and liability
    amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the
    assumptions. We believe that the two most critical assumptions
    affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount
    rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
    weighted average rate of return of 8.40% at both
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. We developed these expected
    long-term rate of return assumptions by



evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. The expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of
    investment types in such assets. The target investment
    allocation for our plan assets is 50% U.S. large cap equity
    securities; 15% U.S. small cap equity securities, equally
    allocated between growth and value; 15% international equity
    securities, equally allocated between growth and value; and 20%
    debt securities. We expect our long-term asset allocation on
    average to approximate the targeted allocation. We regularly
    review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance
    the investments to the targeted allocation when considered
    appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
    assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
    assumption of 100 basis points (from 8.40% to 7.40%) would
    increase the expected 2007 pension expense by $6 million.

We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted
    average rate of 5.72% at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.
    The discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on
    the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled. This
    rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after allowing for
    call and default risk. We consider high quality corporate bond
    yield indices, such as Moody’s Aa, when selecting the
    discount rate.

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
    as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
    25 basis points (from 5.72% to 5.47%) would increase our
    pension liability at December 31, 2006, by
    $25 million, and increase estimated 2007 pension expense by
    $3 million.

At December 31, 2006, we had actuarial losses of
    $214 million which will be recognized as a component of
    pension expense in future years. These losses are primarily due
    to reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in
    participant wages. We estimate that approximately
    $15 million and $13 million of the unrecognized
    actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2007 and
    2008, respectively. The $15 million estimated to be
    recognized in 2007 is a component of the total estimated 2007
    pension expense of $43 million referred to earlier in this
    section.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
    various other factors related to the participants in our defined
    benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and
    liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors
    will be in the future.

On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act was signed
    into law. Beginning in 2008, this act will cause extensive
    changes in the determination of both the minimum required
    contribution and the maximum tax deductible limit. Because the
    new required contribution will approximate our current policy of
    fully funding the accumulated benefit obligation, the changes
    are not expected to have a significant impact on future cash
    flows.

Beginning with our December 31, 2006 balance sheet,
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),

requires us to
    recognize on our consolidated balance sheet the funded status of
    our defined benefit plans. The funded status is measured as the
    difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair
    value of plan assets. As a result, we recognized as liabilities
    the actuarial losses and other costs that were previously
    unrecognized under prior accounting rules, and the net effect
    was also recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity on
    December 31, 2006. This reduction was $140 million, or
    less than 1% of our stockholders’ equity.

Contingencies
    and Legal Matters

    of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported



amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these
    estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when
    known.

The critical accounting policies used by management in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those
    that are important both to the presentation of our financial
    condition and results of operations and require significant
    judgments by management with regard to estimates used. Our
    critical accounting policies and significant judgments and
    estimates related to those policies are described below. We have
    reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors.

Full
    Cost Ceiling Calculations

Policy
    Description

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
    calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
    amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
    sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
    after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
    properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
    value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
    subject to amortization. If our net book value of oil and gas
    properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of
    the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an
    expense, except as discussed in the following paragraph. The
    ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in
    which we have oil and gas properties.

If, subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the
    applicable financial statements being published, prices increase
    to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be
    recovered, a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the
    quarter is not required to be recorded. A writedown indicated at
    the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of
    additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the
    quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements
    would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered,
    as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter.
    An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a
    subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have
    increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The discounted present value of future net revenues for our
    proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is a major component of
    the ceiling calculation, and represents the component that
    requires the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves
    are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates
    of production and the timing of future expenditures. The process
    of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves requires
    substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations,
    particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers
    may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the
    same data. Certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or
    audited by outside petroleum consultants, while other reserve
    estimates are prepared by our engineers. See Note 15 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
    regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior
    estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
    years, annual revisions to our reserve estimates, which have
    been both increases and decreases in individual years, have
    averaged approximately 1% of the previous year’s estimate.
    However, there can be no assurance that more significant
    revisions will not be necessary in the future. If future
    significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously
    estimated reserve quantities, it could result in a full cost
    property writedown. In addition to the impact of the estimates
    of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling, estimates
    of proved reserves are also a significant component of the
    calculation of DD&A.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
    judgment, the associated prices of oil, natural gas and NGL
    reserves, and the applicable discount rate, that are used to
    calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not
    require judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10%
    discount factor be used



and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the
    period are held constant indefinitely. Therefore, the future net
    revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not
    based on our assessment of future prices or costs. Rather, they
    are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of
    each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed. In
    calculating the ceiling, we adjust the

end-of-period

price by the effect of cash flow hedges in place. This
    adjustment requires little judgment as the

end-of-period

price is adjusted using the contract prices for our cash flow
    hedges. We had no such hedges outstanding at December 31,
    2006.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect
    as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
    indefinitely, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting
    value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.
    Oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. On
    any particular day at the end of a quarter, prices can be either
    substantially higher or lower than our long-term price forecast
    that is a barometer for true fair value. Therefore, oil and gas
    property writedowns that result from applying the full cost
    ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price
    as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
    reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a
    reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Policy
    Description

The majority of our historical derivative instruments have
    consisted of commodity financial instruments used to manage our
    cash flow exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We have also
    entered into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to
    interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps mitigate
    either the cash flow effects of interest rate fluctuations on
    interest expense for variable-rate debt instruments, or the fair
    value effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed-rate debt.
    We also have an embedded option derivative related to the fair
    value of our debentures exchangeable into shares of Chevron
    Corporation common stock.

All derivatives are recognized at their current fair value on
    our balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
    such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If hedge accounting criteria are
    met for fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is
    recorded in the statement of operations with an offsetting
    amount recorded for the change in fair value of the hedged item.

A derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment
    if we designate the instrument as such on the date the
    derivative contract is entered into or the date of an
    acquisition or business combination which includes derivative
    contracts. Additionally, we must document the relationship
    between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as the
    risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    instrument. We must also assess, both at the instrument’s
    inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative is
    highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the
    hedged item.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative
    instruments require substantial judgment. For these instruments,
    we obtain forward price and volatility data for all major oil
    and gas trading points in North America from independent third
    parties. These forward prices are compared to the price
    parameters contained in the hedge agreements. The resulting
    estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the
    hedge contracts are discounted using LIBOR and money market
    futures rates for the first year and money market futures and
    swap rates thereafter. In addition, we estimate the option value
    of price floors and price caps using an option pricing model.
    These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the
    period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes
    in forward prices, regional price differentials and interest
    rates. Fair values of our other derivative instruments require
    less judgment to estimate and are primarily based on quotes from
    independent third parties such as counterparties or brokers.



Quarterly changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal
    impact on our liquidity, capital resources or results of
    operations, as long as the derivative instruments qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair values of
    derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
    can have a significant impact on our results of operations, but
    generally will not impact our liquidity or capital resources.
    Settlements of derivative instruments, regardless of whether
    they qualify for hedge accounting, do have an impact on our
    liquidity and results of operations. Generally, if actual market
    prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments,
    our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower
    relative to the results that would have occurred absent these
    instruments. The opposite is also true. Additional information
    regarding the effects that changes in market prices will have on
    our derivative financial instruments, net earnings and cash flow
    from operations is included in “Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.’’

Business
    Combinations

Policy
    Description

We have grown substantially during recent years through
    acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies. Most of
    these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting, and recent accounting pronouncements
    require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using
    the purchase method.

Under the purchase method, the acquiring company adds to its
    balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired
    company’s assets and liabilities. Any excess of the
    purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and
    intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is assessed for impairment at least annually.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

There are various assumptions we make in determining the fair
    values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities. The
    most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most
    judgment, involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas
    properties acquired. To determine the fair values of these
    properties, we prepare estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL
    reserves. These estimates are based on work performed by our
    engineers and that of outside consultants. The judgments
    associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier
    in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling
    calculation.

However, there are factors involved in estimating the fair
    values of acquired oil, natural gas and NGL properties that
    require more judgment than that involved in the full cost
    ceiling calculation. As stated above, the full cost ceiling
    calculation applies

end-of-period

price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the
    ceiling amount. By contrast, the fair value of reserves acquired
    in a business combination must be based on our estimates of
    future oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Our estimates of future
    prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends. These
    estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to
    regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as
    economic growth forecasts. They are also based on industry data
    regarding natural gas storage availability, drilling rig
    activity, changes in delivery capacity, trends in regional
    pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis. Forecasts
    of future prices from independent third parties are noted when
    we make our pricing estimates.

We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve
    quantities acquired, and estimate future operating and
    development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net
    revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues
    are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the
    time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital.

We also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair
    value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination.
    These unproved properties generally represent the value of
    probable and possible reserves. Because of their very nature,
    probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than
    those of proved reserves. To compensate for the inherent risk of
    estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future
    net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by
    what we consider to be an appropriate risk-weighting factor in
    each particular instance. It is common for the discounted future
    net



revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by
    factors ranging from 30% to 80% to arrive at what we consider to
    be the appropriate fair values.

Generally, in our business combinations, the determination of
    the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more
    judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities.
    The acquired companies commonly have long-term debt that we
    assume in the acquisition, and this debt must be recorded at the
    estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt. However,
    significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in
    these situations due to the existence of comparable market
    values of debt issued by peer companies.

Except for the 2002 Mitchell merger, our mergers and
    acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were
    predominantly in the area of exploration, development and
    production activities related to oil and gas properties.
    However, in addition to exploration, development and production
    activities, Mitchell’s business also included substantial
    marketing and midstream activities. Therefore, a portion of the
    Mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of
    Mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and
    equipment. This consisted primarily of natural gas processing
    plants and natural gas pipeline systems.

The Mitchell midstream assets primarily served gas producing
    properties that we also acquired from Mitchell. Therefore,
    certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the
    gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the
    midstream assets. For example, future quantities of natural gas
    estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were
    based on the same estimates used to value the proved and
    unproved gas producing properties. Future expected prices for
    marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price
    cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas
    producing assets acquired from Mitchell. Based on historical
    costs and known trends and commitments, we also estimated future
    operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream
    assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows. These cash
    flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to
    discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets
    to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and
    midstream facilities and equipment.

In addition to the valuation methods described above, we perform
    other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in
    any business combination. These analyses include information
    related to comparable companies, comparable transactions and
    premiums paid.

In a comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
    market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
    independent exploration and production companies with comparable
    financial and operating characteristics. Such characteristics
    are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
    characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to
    those of the party to the proposed business combination. We
    compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed
    business combination company multiples for reasonableness.

In a comparable transactions analysis, we review certain
    acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and
    production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages
    announced recently. We compare these comparable transaction
    multiples to the proposed business combination transaction
    multiples for reasonableness.

In a premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected
    independent exploration and production company transactions in
    addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded
    companies announced recently, to review the premiums paid to the
    price of the target one day, one week and one month prior to the
    announcement of the transaction. We use this information to
    determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to
    the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness.

While these estimates of fair value for the various assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity
    or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future
    results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value
    assigned to both the oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas
    properties, the lower future net earnings will be as a result of
    higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
    Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas
    properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas
    prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling
    writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas



prices drop below our price forecast that was used to originally
    determine fair value. A full cost ceiling writedown would have
    no effect on our liquidity or capital resources in that period
    because it is a noncash charge, but it would adversely affect
    results of operations. As discussed in “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Capital Resources, Uses and
    Liquidity,” in calculating our

debt-to-capitalization

ratio under our credit agreement, total capitalization is
    adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full
    cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments.

Our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many
    estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair
    value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business
    combination. As previously disclosed in our discussion of the
    full cost ceiling calculations, during the past five years, our
    annual revisions to our reserve estimates have averaged
    approximately 1%. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
    there are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity
    estimates that are involved in determining the fair value of oil
    and gas properties acquired in a business combination. The
    inter-relationship of these estimates makes it impractical to
    provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of
    changes in these estimates.

Valuation
    of Goodwill

Policy
    Description

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. This
    requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and
    liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above
    for a business combination. Therefore, considerable judgment
    similar to that described above in connection with estimating
    the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination
    is also required to assess goodwill for impairment.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil
    and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower
    goodwill would be. A lower goodwill value decreases the
    likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes
    in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the
    likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill
    impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital
    resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of
    operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
    in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
    provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
    changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
    average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Interpretation No. 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
    financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement
    No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

This
    Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006, and we will adopt it in the first
    quarter of 2007. We do not expect the adoption of Interpretation
    No. 48 to have a material impact on our financial
    statements and related disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements.

Statement No. 157 provides a common
    definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. However, this Statement does not require any new
    fair value measurements. Statement No. 157 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are
    currently assessing the effect, if any, the adoption of
    Statement No. 157 will have on our financial statements and
    related disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R).

Statement No. 158 requires the
    recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined
    benefit postretirement plan in the balance sheet. We adopted
    this recognition requirement



as of December 31, 2006. The effects of this adoption are
    summarized in Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. Statement No. 158 also requires the
    measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the
    date of the employer’s fiscal year-end. The Statement
    provides two alternatives to transition to a fiscal year-end
    measurement date. This measurement requirement is effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. We have not
    yet adopted this measurement requirement, but we do not expect
    such adoption to have a material effect on our results of
    operations, financial condition, liquidity or compliance with
    debt covenants.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including
    an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.

Statement
    No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure certain
    financial instruments and other items at fair value. The
    objective is to improve financial reporting by providing
    entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported
    earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
    differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting
    provisions. Unrealized gains and losses on any items for which
    we elect the fair value measurement option would be reported in
    earnings. Statement No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. However, early adoption
    is permitted for fiscal years beginning on or before
    November 15, 2007, provided we also elect to apply the
    provisions of Statement No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, at the same time. We are currently assessing
    the effect, if any, the adoption of Statement No. 159 will
    have on our financial statements and related disclosures.

    Estimates

The forward-looking statements provided in this discussion are
    based on our examination of historical operating trends, the
    information which was used to prepare the December 31, 2006
    reserve reports and other data in our possession or available
    from third parties. These forward-looking statements were
    prepared assuming demand, curtailment, producibility and general
    market conditions for our oil, natural gas and NGLs during 2007
    will be substantially similar to those of 2006, unless otherwise
    noted. We make reference to the “Disclosure Regarding
    Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this
    report. Amounts related to Canadian operations have been
    converted to U.S. dollars using a projected
    average 2007 exchange rate of $0.89 U.S. dollar to
    $1.00 Canadian dollar.

On November 14, 2006, we announced our intent to divest our
    Egyptian oil and gas assets and terminate our operations in
    Egypt. We expect to complete this asset sale during the first
    half of 2007. Subsequently on January 23, 2007, we
    announced our intent to divest our West African oil and gas
    assets and terminate our operations in West Africa. We expect to
    complete this asset sale by the end of the third quarter in
    2007. All Egyptian and West African related revenues, expenses
    and capital will be reported as discontinued operations in our
    2007 financial statements. Accordingly, all forward-looking
    estimates in the following discussion exclude amounts related to
    our operations in Egypt and West Africa, unless otherwise noted.
    The assets held for sale represented less than five percent of
    our 2006 production and December 31, 2006 proved reserves.

Oil,
    Gas and NGL Production

Set forth in the following paragraphs are individual estimates
    of oil, gas and NGL production for 2007. We estimate, on a
    combined basis, that our 2007 oil, gas, and NGL production will
    total approximately 219 to 221 MMBoe. Of this total,
    approximately 92% is estimated to be produced from reserves
    classified as “proved” at December 31, 2006. The
    following estimates for oil, gas and NGL production are
    calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total
    production.



Oil
    Production

Oil production in 2007 is expected to total approximately
    55 MMBbls. Of this total, approximately 99% is estimated to
    be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at
    December 31, 2006. The expected production by area is as
    follows:

Oil
    Prices

We have not fixed the price we will receive on any of our 2007
    oil production. Our 2007 average prices for each of our areas
    are expected to differ from the NYMEX price as set forth in the
    following table. The NYMEX price is the monthly average of
    settled prices on each trading day for benchmark West Texas
    Intermediate crude oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma.

Gas production in 2007 is expected to total approximately
    841 Bcf. Of this total, approximately 88% is estimated to
    be produced from reserves classified as “proved” at
    December 31, 2006. The expected production by area is as
    follows:

Gas
    Prices

Our 2007 average prices for each of our areas are expected to
    differ from the NYMEX price as set forth in the following table.
    The NYMEX price is determined to be the

first-of-month

South Louisiana Henry Hub price index as published monthly in

Inside FERC.

Based on contracts currently in place, we will have
    approximately 116 MMcf per day of gas production in 2007
    that is subject to either fixed-price contracts, swaps, floors
    or collars. These amounts represent approximately 5% of our
    estimated gas production for 2007. Therefore, these various
    pricing arrangements are not expected to have a material impact
    on the ranges of estimated gas price realizations set forth in
    the following table.

    and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived
    primarily from our natural gas processing plants and natural gas
    transport pipelines. These revenues and expenses vary in
    response to several factors. The factors include, but are not
    limited to, changes in production from wells connected to the
    pipelines and related processing plants, changes in the absolute
    and relative prices of natural gas and NGLs, provisions of the
    contract agreements and the amount of repair and workover
    activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels.

These factors, coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas
    and NGL prices, increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
    future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
    these uncertainties, we estimate that marketing and midstream
    revenues will be between $1.70 billion and
    $2.10 billion, and marketing and midstream expenses will be
    between $1.31 billion and $1.67 billion.

Production
    and Operating Expenses

Our production and operating expenses include lease operating
    expenses, transportation costs and production taxes. These
    expenses vary in response to several factors. Among the most
    significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from
    the property base, changes in the general price level of
    services and materials that are used in the operation of the
    properties, the amount of repair and workover activity required
    and changes in production tax rates. Oil, natural gas and NGL
    prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and
    impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects.
    Given these uncertainties, we estimate that 2007 lease operating
    expenses (including transportation costs) will be between
    $1.70 billion and $1.77 billion. Additionally, we
    estimate our production taxes for 2007 to be between 3.6% and
    4.1% of consolidated oil, natural gas and NGL revenues.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”)

The 2007 oil and gas property DD&A rate will depend on
    various factors. Most notable among such factors are the amount
    of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or
    acquisition efforts in 2007 compared to the costs incurred for
    such efforts, and the revisions to our year-end 2006 reserve
    estimates that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made
    during 2007.

Given these uncertainties, we expect our oil and gas property
    related DD&A rate will be between $11.00 per Boe and
    $11.50 per Boe. Based on these DD&A rates and the
    production estimates set forth earlier, oil and gas property
    related DD&A expense for 2007 is expected to be between
    $2.42 billion and $2.53 billion.

Additionally, we expect our depreciation and amortization
    expense related to non-oil and gas property fixed assets to
    total between $210 million and $220 million.

Accretion
    of Asset Retirement Obligation

Accretion of asset retirement obligation in 2007 is expected to
    be between $45 million and $55 million.



General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our G&A includes employee compensation and benefits costs
    and the costs of many different goods and services used in
    support of our business. G&A varies with the level of our
    operating activities and the related staffing and professional
    services requirements. In addition, employee compensation and
    benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect
    the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to
    employees. Also, goods and services are subject to general price
    level increases or decreases. Therefore, significant variances
    in any of these factors from current expectations could cause
    actual G&A to vary materially from the estimate.

Given these limitations, G&A in 2007 is expected to be
    between $460 million and $480 million. This estimate
    includes approximately $60 million of noncash, share-based
    compensation, net of related capitalization in accordance with
    the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties described in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates.” Reductions to the carrying value of our oil and
    gas properties are largely dependent on the success of drilling
    results and oil and natural gas prices at the end of our
    quarterly reporting periods. Due to the uncertain nature of
    future drilling efforts and oil and natural gas prices, we are
    not able to predict whether we will incur such reductions in
    2007.

Interest
    Expense

Future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant
    effect on our interest expense. We can only marginally influence
    the prices we will receive in 2007 from sales of oil, natural
    gas and NGLs and the resulting cash flow. These factors increase
    the margin of error inherent in estimating future outstanding
    debt balances and related interest expense. Other factors which
    affect outstanding debt balances and related interest expense,
    such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures and
    proceeds from the sale of our assets in Egypt and West Africa,
    are generally within our control.

Based on the information related to interest expense set forth
    below, we expect our 2007 interest expense to be between
    $400 million and $410 million. This estimate assumes
    no material changes in prevailing interest rates. This estimate
    also assumes no material changes in our expected level of
    indebtedness, except for an assumption that our commercial paper
    will be repaid at the end of the second quarter of 2007.

The interest expense in 2007 related to our fixed-rate debt,
    including net accretion of related discounts, will be
    approximately $410 million. This fixed-rate debt removes
    the uncertainty of future interest rates from some, but not all,
    of our long-term debt.

Our floating rate debt is comprised of variable-rate commercial
    paper and one debt instrument which has been converted to
    floating rate debt through the use of an interest rate swap. Our
    floating rate debt is summarized in the following table:

LIBOR plus 40 basis points

The interest rate is based on a standard index such as the
    Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as found on
    the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2006, the
    average rate on the outstanding balance was 5.37%.



Based on estimates of future LIBOR rates as of December 31,
    2006, interest expense on floating rate debt, including net
    amortization of premiums, is expected to total between
    $80 million and $90 million in 2007.

Our interest expense totals include payments of facility and
    agency fees, amortization of debt issuance costs and other
    miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances
    outstanding. We expect between $5 million and
    $15 million of such items to be included in our 2007
    interest expense. Also, we expect to capitalize between
    $95 million and $105 million of interest during 2007.

Effects
    of Changes in Foreign Currency Rates

Foreign currency gains or losses are not expected to be material
    in 2007.

Other
    Income

We estimate that our other income in 2007 will be between
    $65 million and $85 million.

Historically, we maintained a comprehensive insurance program
    that included coverage for physical damage to our offshore
    facilities caused by hurricanes. Our historical insurance
    program also included substantial business interruption coverage
    which we are utilizing to recover costs associated with the
    suspended production related to hurricanes that struck the Gulf
    of Mexico in the third quarter of 2005.

Based on current estimates of physical damage and the
    anticipated length of time we will have production suspended, we
    expect our policy recoveries will exceed repair costs and
    deductible amounts. This expectation is based upon several
    variables, including the $467 million received in the third
    quarter of 2006 as a full settlement of the amount due from our
    primary insurers. As of December 31, 2006,
    $154 million of these proceeds had been utilized as
    reimbursement of past repair costs and deductible amounts. The
    remaining proceeds of $313 million will be utilized as
    reimbursement of our anticipated future repair costs. We have
    not yet received any settlements related to claims filed with
    our secondary insurers.

Should our total policy recoveries, including the partial
    settlements already received from our primary insurers, exceed
    all repair costs and deductible amounts, such excess will be
    recognized as other income in the statement of operations in the
    period in which such determination can be made. Based on the
    most recent estimates of our costs for repairs, we believe that
    some amount will ultimately be recorded as other income.
    However, the timing and amount that would be recorded as other
    income are uncertain. Therefore, the 2007 estimate for other
    income above does not include any amount related to hurricane
    proceeds.

Income
    Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2007 will vary materially
    depending on the actual amount of financial pre-tax earnings.
    The tax rate for 2007 will be significantly affected by the
    proportional share of consolidated pre-tax earnings generated by
    U.S., Canadian and International operations due to the different
    tax rates of each country. There are certain tax deductions and
    credits that will have a fixed impact on 2007 income tax expense
    regardless of the level of pre-tax earnings that are produced.

Given the uncertainty of pre-tax earnings, we expect that our
    consolidated financial income tax rate in 2007 will be between
    20% and 40%. The current income tax rate is expected to be
    between 15% and 25%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to
    be between 5% and 15%. Significant changes in estimated capital
    expenditures, production levels of oil, natural gas and NGLs,
    the prices of such products, marketing and midstream revenues,
    or any of the various expense items could materially alter the
    effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2007
    financial income tax rates.

Discontinued
    Operations

As previously discussed, we intend to divest our Egyptian and
    West African operations in 2007. We expect to complete the sale
    of Egypt during the first half of 2007 and the sale of West
    Africa during the third quarter of 2007. The following table
    shows the estimates for 2007 oil, gas and NGL production as well
    as the



anticipated production and operating expenses associated with
    these discontinued operations for 2007. These estimates assume
    the sales of Egypt and West Africa will occur at the end of the
    second quarter of 2007. Pursuant to accounting rules for
    discontinued operations, the Egyptian assets will not be subject
    to DD&A during 2007 and the West African assets will only be
    subject to DD&A for the first month of 2007.

Capital
    Expenditures

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions in
    recent years, these transactions are opportunity driven. Thus,
    we do not “budget,” nor can we reasonably predict, the
    timing or size of such possible acquisitions.

Our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of
    future oil, natural gas and NGL prices as well as the expected
    costs of the capital additions. Should actual prices received
    differ materially from our price expectations for our future
    production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred and,
    consequently, may increase or decrease total 2007 capital
    expenditures. In addition, if the actual material or labor costs
    of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated
    amounts, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from
    our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed above, the following table shows
    expected drilling, development and facilities expenditures by
    geographic area. Production capital related to proved reserves
    relates to reserves classified as proved as of year-end 2006.
    Other production capital includes drilling that does not offset
    currently productive units and for which there is not a
    certainty of continued production from a known productive
    formation. Exploration capital includes exploratory drilling to
    find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks
    or new reservoirs.

In addition to the above expenditures for drilling, development
    and facilities, we expect to spend between $330 million to
    $370 million on our marketing and midstream assets, which
    include our oil pipelines, gas processing plants,
    CO


removal facilities and gas transport pipelines. We also expect
    to capitalize between $245 million and $255 million of
    G&A expenses in accordance with the full cost method of
    accounting and to capitalize between $95 million and
    $105 million of interest. We also expect to pay between
    $40 million and $50 million for plugging and
    abandonment charges, and to spend between $135 million and
    $145 million for other non-oil and gas property fixed
    assets.



Other
    Cash Uses

Our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common
    stock dividend to continue. With the current $0.1125 per
    share quarterly dividend rate and 444 million shares of
    common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2006, dividends
    are expected to approximate $200 million. Also, we have
    $150 million of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock upon which
    we will pay $10 million of dividends in 2007.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Our estimated 2007 cash uses, including our drilling and
    development activities, retirement of debt and repurchase of
    common stock, are expected to be funded primarily through a
    combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of
    our assets in Egypt and West Africa. Any remaining cash uses
    could be funded by increasing our borrowings under our
    commercial paper program or with borrowings from the available
    capacity under our credit facility, which was $408 million
    at December 31, 2006. The amount of operating cash flow to
    be generated during 2007 is uncertain due to the factors
    affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited. However, we
    expect our combined capital resources to be more than adequate
    to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and other cash uses
    for 2007.

If significant other acquisitions or other unplanned capital
    requirements arise during the year, we could utilize our
    existing credit facility

and/or

seek
    to establish and utilize other sources of financing.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market
    risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse
    changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. The disclosures are not meant to be
    precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
    instruments were entered into for purposes other than
    speculative trading.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
    our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
    driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
    market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian natural gas
    and NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has
    been volatile and unpredictable for several years. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Currently, we are largely accepting the volatility risk that
    oil, natural gas and NGL prices present. None of our future oil
    production is subject to price swaps or collars. With regard to
    our future natural gas production, based on contracts currently
    in place, we will have approximately 116 MMcf per day of
    gas production in 2007 that is subject to either fixed-price
    contracts, swaps, floors or collars. This amount represents
    approximately 5% of our estimated 2007 gas production (3% of our
    total Boe production). For the years 2008 through 2011, we have
    fixed-price physical delivery contracts covering Canadian
    natural gas production ranging from seven Bcf to 14 Bcf per
    year. These contracts are not expected to have a material effect
    on our realized gas prices from 2007 through 2011.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2006, we had debt outstanding of
    $7.8 billion. Of this amount, $5.6 billion, or 72%,
    bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.3%. Additionally, we
    had $1.8 billion of outstanding commercial paper



bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 5.37% at
    December 31, 2006. The remaining debt consists of
    $400 million 4.375% senior notes due in October of
    2007. Through the use of an interest rate swap, this fixed-rate
    debt has been converted to floating-rate debt bearing interest
    equal to LIBOR plus 40 basis points.

We use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the
    hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on
    the fair value of any outstanding interest rate swap
    instruments. At December 31, 2006, a 10% increase in the
    underlying interest rates would have decreased the fair value of
    our interest rate swap by $2 million.

The above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes
    accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
    because of the short-term maturity of such instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
    subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of
    such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional
    currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable
    exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues,
    expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange
    rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in
    the

Canadian-to-U.S. dollar

exchange rate would not materially impact our December 31,
    2006 balance sheet.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, comprehensive income,
    stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, as of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, and as of December 31, 2006 the
    Company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Devon Energy Corporation’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
    subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
    conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The more significant of such policies
    are briefly discussed below.

Nature
    of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration,
    development and production, and the acquisition of properties.
    Such activities in the United States are concentrated in the
    following geographic areas:

•

the Mid-Continent area of the central and southern United
    States, principally in north and east Texas and Oklahoma;

•

the Permian Basin within Texas and New Mexico;

•

the Rocky Mountains area of the United States stretching from
    the Canadian border into northern New Mexico;

•

the offshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico; and

•

the onshore areas of the Gulf Coast, principally in south Texas
    and south Louisiana.

Devon’s Canadian activities are located primarily in the
    Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Devon’s international
    activities — outside of North America — are
    located primarily in Azerbaijan, Brazil, China and various
    countries in West Africa. On January 23, 2007, Devon
    announced its plans to divest its West African operations. See
    Note 13.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations which are
    responsible for marketing natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and
    constructing and operating pipelines, storage and treating
    facilities and gas processing plants. These services are
    performed for Devon as well as for unrelated third parties.

The accounts of Devon’s controlled subsidiaries are
    included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include estimates of proved reserves and related
    present value estimates of future net revenue, the carrying
    value of oil and gas properties, goodwill impairment assessment,
    asset retirement obligations, income taxes, valuation of
    derivative instruments, obligations related to employee benefits
    and legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Property
    and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
    gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
    acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
    properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
    and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
    incurred that are directly identified with acquisition,
    exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for
    its own account, and which are not related to production,
    general corporate overhead or similar activities, are also
    capitalized. Interest costs incurred and attributable to
    unproved oil and gas properties under current evaluation



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and major development projects of oil and gas properties are
    also capitalized. All costs related to production activities,
    including workover costs incurred solely to maintain or increase
    levels of production from an existing completion interval, are
    charged to expense as incurred.

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
    oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
    limitation is the estimated after-tax future net revenues,
    discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil, natural gas
    and NGL reserves plus the cost of properties not subject to
    amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude future cash
    outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations
    included in the net book value of oil and gas properties. Such
    limitations are imposed separately on a

country-by-country

basis and are tested quarterly. In calculating future net
    revenues, prices and costs used are those as of the end of the
    appropriate quarterly period. These prices are not changed
    except where different prices are fixed and determinable from
    applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts,
    including designated cash flow hedges in place. Devon had no
    such hedges outstanding at December 31, 2006 or
    December 31, 2005.

Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes,
    over the ceiling is written off as an expense. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Capitalized costs are depleted by an equivalent

unit-of-production

method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic
    feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is
    calculated using the capitalized costs, including estimated
    asset retirement costs, plus the estimated future expenditures
    (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing proved
    reserves, net of estimated salvage values.

Unproved properties are excluded from amortized capitalized
    costs until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can
    be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved
    properties for impairment quarterly. Significant unproved
    properties are assessed individually. Costs of insignificant
    unproved properties are transferred to amortizable costs over
    average holding periods ranging from three years for onshore
    properties to seven years for offshore properties.

No gain or loss is recognized upon disposal of oil and gas
    properties unless such disposal significantly alters the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in a
    particular country.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a

units-of-production

basis. Depreciation and amortization of other property and
    equipment, including corporate and other midstream assets and
    leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to
    39 years.

Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations
    associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing
    well sites, offshore production platforms, and natural gas
    processing plants when there is a legal obligation associated
    with the retirement of such assets and the amount can be
    reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset
    retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair
    value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an
    increase to the associated property and equipment on the
    consolidated balance sheet. If the fair value of a recorded
    asset retirement obligation changes, a revision is recorded to
    both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement
    cost. The asset retirement cost is depreciated using a
    systematic and rational method similar to that used for the
    associated property and equipment.

Short-Term
    Investments and Other Marketable Securities

Devon reports its short-term investments and other marketable
    securities at fair value, except for debt securities in which
    management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, Devon’s short-term
    investments consisted of $574 million and
    $680 million, respectively, of auction rate



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

securities classified as available for sale. Although
    Devon’s auction rate securities have contractual maturities
    of more than 10 years, the underlying interest rates on
    such securities reset at intervals ranging from seven to
    90 days. Therefore, these auction rate securities are
    priced and subsequently trade as short-term investments because
    of the interest rate reset feature. As a result, Devon has
    classified its auction rate securities as short-term investments
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Devon’s only other significant investment security is its
    investment in approximately 14.2 million shares of Chevron
    Corporation common stock which is reported at fair value. Except
    for unrealized losses that are determined to be “other than
    temporary”, the tax effected unrealized gain or loss on the
    investment in Chevron Corporation common stock is recognized in
    other comprehensive income and reported as a separate component
    of stockholders’ equity.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
    quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
    reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
    estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
    comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
    Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
    fourth quarters of 2006, 2005 and 2004. Based on these
    assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
    assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005:

Revenue
    Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold
    to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is transferred
    when production has been delivered to a pipeline or truck or a
    tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating to future
    production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by governmental
    authorities on oil, gas and NGL revenues are presented
    separately from such revenues as production taxes in the
    statement of operations.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining
    reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under produced
    owner to recoup its entitled share through production. If an
    imbalance exists at the time the wells’ reserves are
    depleted, settlements are made among the joint interest owners
    under a variety of arrangements. The liability is priced based
    on current market prices. No receivables



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken less than its
    share of production unless all revenue recognition criteria are
    met.

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
    products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
    fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to
    Devon’s gas and NGL purchase and processing contracts are
    reported on a gross basis since Devon takes title to the
    products and has risks and rewards of ownership. The gas
    purchased under these contracts is processed in Devon-owned
    plants.

Major
    Purchasers

During 2006, revenues received from ExxonMobil and its
    affiliates were $1.1 billion, or 10% of Devon’s
    consolidated revenues. No purchaser accounted for over 10% of
    Devon’s revenues in 2005 or 2004.

Derivative
    Instruments

The majority of Devon’s derivative instruments consist of
    commodity financial instruments used to manage Devon’s cash
    flow exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Devon has also
    entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to
    interest rate volatility. The interest rate swaps mitigate
    either the cash flow effects of interest rate fluctuations on
    interest expense for variable-rate debt instruments, or the fair
    value effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed-rate debt.
    Devon also has an embedded option derivative related to the fair
    value of its debentures exchangeable into shares of Chevron
    Corporation common stock.

All derivatives are recognized at their current fair value as
    fair value of derivative financial instruments on the balance
    sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial
    instruments are recorded in the statement of operations unless
    specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If such criteria are
    met for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in
    the fair value is recorded directly to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity,
    until the hedged transaction occurs. The ineffective portion of
    the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of
    operations. If such criteria are met for fair value hedges, the
    change in the fair value is recorded in the statement of
    operations with an offsetting amount recorded for the change in
    fair value of the hedged item.

A derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment
    if Devon designates the instrument as such on the date the
    derivative contract is entered into or the date of an
    acquisition or business combination which includes derivative
    contracts. Additionally, Devon must document the relationship
    between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as the
    risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    instrument. Devon must also assess, both at the
    instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash
    flow of the hedged item.

During 2006, Devon entered into and acquired certain commodity
    derivative instruments. For such instruments, Devon chose not to
    meet the necessary criteria to qualify these derivative
    instruments for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, Devon
    recorded a $37 million gain in gas sales in the statement
    of operations for the change in fair value related to these
    instruments.

The change in the fair value of the embedded option relates to
    the debentures exchangeable into shares of Chevron Corporation
    common stock. These expenses were caused primarily by increases
    in the price of Chevron Corporation’s common stock.

During 2005 and 2004, Devon had a number of commodity derivative
    instruments that qualified for hedge accounting treatment as
    described above. During 2005, certain of these derivatives
    ceased to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In the third
    quarter of 2005, certain oil derivatives ceased to qualify for
    hedge accounting primarily as a result of deferred production
    caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Because these
    contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting, Devon
    recognized $39 million in losses as change in fair value of
    derivative financial instruments in the accompanying
    2005 statement of operations.

In addition to the changes in fair value of non-qualifying
    commodity hedges presented in the table above, Devon also
    recognized in 2005 a $55 million loss related to certain
    oil hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to
    the effect of the 2005 property divestiture program. These
    commodity instruments related to 5,000 barrels per day of
    U.S. oil production and 3,000 barrels per day of
    Canadian oil production from properties that were sold as part
    of Devon’s divestiture program. This loss is presented in
    other income in the accompanying 2005 statement of
    operations. During 2004, no derivatives ceased to qualify for
    hedge accounting.

In addition to the changes in fair value of Devon’s
    interest rate swaps presented in the table above, settlements on
    these interest rate swaps increased interest expense by
    $15 million and $12 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, and decreased interest expense $18 million in
    2004.

The following table presents the balances of Devon’s
    accumulated net gain (loss) on cash flow hedges included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income.

By using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in
    commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes itself to
    credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the
    counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative
    contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are
    placed with counterparties that Devon believes are minimal
    credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative
    contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed
    by management to be competent and competitive market makers.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative
    instrument that results from a change in commodity prices,
    interest rates or other relevant underlyings. The market risk
    associated with commodity price and interest rate contracts is
    managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the
    types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. The oil
    and gas reference prices upon which the commodity hedging
    instruments are based reflect various market indices that have a
    high degree of historical correlation with actual prices
    received by Devon. Devon does not hold or issue derivative
    instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Stock
    Options

Effective January 1, 2006, Devon adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

, (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), using the
    modified prospective transition method.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires equity-classified,
    share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
    stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant
    and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Under the
    modified prospective transition method, share-based awards
    granted or modified on or after January 1, 2006, are
    recognized in compensation expense over the applicable vesting
    period. Also, any previously granted awards that were not fully
    vested as of January 1, 2006 are recognized as compensation
    expense over the remaining vesting period. No retroactive or
    cumulative effect adjustments were required upon Devon’s
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to adopting SFAS No. 123(R), Devon accounted for
    its fixed-plan employee stock options using the intrinsic-value
    based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

(“APB No. 25”) and related interpretations.
    This method required compensation expense to be recorded on the
    date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying
    stock exceeded the exercise price.

Had the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) been
    applied in 2005 and 2004, Devon’s net earnings and net
    earnings per share would have differed from the amounts actually
    reported as shown in the following table.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), Devon’s

    expense was $26 million lower than if Devon had continued
    to account for share-based

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

compensation under APB No. 25. Additionally, 2006 earnings
    from continuing operations and net earnings were both
    $17 million lower. The related 2006 basic and diluted
    earnings per share amounts were both approximately
    $0.04 per share lower. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), Devon presented all tax benefits of
    deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as
    operating cash inflows in the statement of cash flows.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash inflows resulting
    from tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense
    recognized for those stock options (“excess tax
    benefits”) to be classified as financing cash inflows. As
    required by SFAS No. 123(R), Devon recognized
    $36 million of excess tax benefits as financing cash
    inflows for 2006. In 2005 and 2004, excess tax benefits of
    $44 million and $54 million, respectively, were
    classified as operating cash inflows.

Income
    Taxes

Devon accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
    method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well
    as the future tax consequences attributable to the future
    utilization of existing tax net operating loss and other types
    of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
    income in the years in which those temporary differences and
    carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The
    effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
    rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date. At December 31, 2006, undistributed
    earnings of foreign subsidiaries were determined to be
    permanently reinvested. Therefore, no U.S. deferred income
    taxes were provided on such amounts at December 31, 2006.
    If it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed
    earnings will be distributed, Devon would then record taxes on
    those earnings.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
    reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
    properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
    pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Net
    Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings
    per share, as calculated using the treasury stock method,
    reflects the potential dilution that could occur if Devon’s
    dilutive outstanding stock options were exercised. For 2005 and
    2004, the calculation of diluted shares also assumed that
    Devon’s previously outstanding zero coupon convertible
    senior debentures were converted to common stock.

Foreign
    Currency Translation Adjustments

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devon’s
    consolidated operations except its Canadian subsidiaries which
    use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore,
    the assets and liabilities of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated into U.S. dollars based on the current
    exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Canadian
    income and expenses are translated at average rates for the
    periods presented. Translation adjustments have no effect on net
    income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income in stockholders’ equity. The following table

Statements
    of Cash Flows

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Devon
    considers all highly liquid investments with original
    contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
    assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures are expensed
    or capitalized in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Liabilities for these expenditures are recorded when it is
    probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Reference is made to Note 8 for a
    discussion of amounts recorded for these liabilities.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Interpretation No. 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
    financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement
    No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

This
    Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006, and Devon will adopt it in the first
    quarter of 2007. Devon does not expect the adoption of
    Interpretation No. 48 to have a material impact on its
    financial statements and related disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements.

Statement No. 157 provides a common
    definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. However, this Statement does not require any new
    fair value measurements. Statement No. 157 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Devon is
    currently assessing the effect, if any, the adoption of
    Statement No. 157 will have on its financial statements and
    related disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R).

Statement No. 158 requires the
    recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined
    benefit postretirement plan in the balance sheet. Devon adopted
    this recognition requirement as of December 31, 2006. The
    effects of this adoption are summarized in Note 6.
    Statement



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

No. 158 also requires the measurement of plan assets and
    benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal
    year-end. The Statement provides two alternatives to transition
    to a fiscal year-end measurement date. This measurement
    requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2008. Devon has not yet adopted this
    measurement requirement, but Devon does not expect such adoption
    to have a material effect on its results of operations,
    financial condition, liquidity or compliance with debt covenants.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including
    an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.

Statement No. 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments and
    other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. Unrealized gains and losses
    on any items for which Devon elects the fair value measurement
    option would be reported in earnings. Statement No. 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. However, early adoption is permitted for fiscal years
    beginning on or before November 15, 2007, provided Devon
    also elects to apply the provisions of Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, at the same time. Devon is
    currently assessing the effect, if any, the adoption of
    Statement No. 159 will have on its financial statements and
    related disclosures.

Chief
    Acquisition

On June 29, 2006, Devon acquired the oil and gas assets of
    privately-owned Chief Holdings LLC (“Chief”). Devon
    paid $2.0 billion in cash and assumed approximately
    $0.2 billion of net liabilities in the transaction for a
    total purchase price of $2.2 billion. Devon funded the
    acquisition price, and the immediate retirement of
    $180 million of assumed debt, with $718 million of
    cash on hand and approximately $1.4 billion of borrowings
    issued under its commercial paper program. The acquired oil and
    gas properties consist of 99.7 MMBoe (unaudited) of proved
    reserves and leasehold totaling 169,000 net acres located
    in the Barnett

Property
    Divestitures

During 2005, Devon divested certain non-core oil and gas
    properties in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the
    United States and Canada. From these sales, Devon received

Under full cost accounting rules, a gain or loss on the sale or
    other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized
    unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of
    oil and gas attributable to a cost center. Because the 2005
    divestitures did not significantly alter such relationship,
    Devon did not recognize a gain or loss on these divestitures.
    Therefore, the proceeds from these transactions were recognized
    as an adjustment of capitalized costs in the respective cost
    centers.

On November 14, 2006, Devon announced that it intends to
    divest its operations in Egypt. Also, on January 23, 2007,
    Devon announced that it intends to divest its operations in West
    Africa. See Note 13 for more discussion regarding these

Credit
    Facilities with Banks

Devon has a $2.5 billion five-year, syndicated, unsecured
    revolving line of credit (the “Senior Credit
    Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility includes a five-year
    revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Senior Credit Facility matures on April 7, 2011, and
    all amounts outstanding will be due and payable at that time
    unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, Devon has the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. Devon is working to obtain lender approval to
    extend the current maturity date of April 7, 2011 to
    April 7, 2012. If successful, this maturity date extension
    will be effective on April 7, 2007, provided Devon has not
    experienced a “material adverse effect,” as defined in
    the Senior Credit Facility agreement, at that date.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the
    election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options
    for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally
    less than the prime rate. Devon may also elect to borrow at the
    prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides for an
    annual facility fee of $2.3 million that is payable
    quarterly in arrears.

The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility contains
    certain covenants and restrictions, including a maximum allowed

debt-to-capitalization

ratio of 65% as defined in the agreement. The credit agreement
    contains definitions of total funded debt and total
    capitalization that include adjustments to the respective
    amounts reported in Devon’s consolidated financial
    statements. Per the agreement, total funded debt excludes the
    debentures that are exchangeable into shares of Chevron
    Corporation common stock. Also, total capitalization is adjusted
    to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost
    ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments. At
    December 31, 2006, Devon was in compliance with such
    covenants and restrictions. Devon’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2006, as calculated pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, was 27.3%.

As of December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility. The available capacity under the Senior
    Credit Facility as of December 31, 2006, net of
    $284 million of outstanding letters of credit and
    $1.8 billion of outstanding commercial paper, was
    approximately $408 million.

Commercial
    Paper

Devon also has a commercial paper program under which it may
    borrow up to $2 billion. Borrowings under the commercial
    paper program reduce available capacity under the Senior Credit
    Facility on a

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    seven to 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index
    such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate
    as found on the commercial paper market. As of December 31,
    2006, Devon had $1.8 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at an average rate of 5.37%. The $1.8 billion
    of commercial paper is classified as short-term debt in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Exchangeable
    Debentures

The exchangeable debentures consist of $444 million of
    4.90% debentures and $316 million of
    4.95% debentures. The exchangeable debentures were issued
    on August 3, 1998 and mature August 15, 2008. The
    exchangeable debentures were callable beginning August 15,
    2000, initially at 104.0% of principal and at prices declining
    to 100.5% of principal on or after August 15, 2007. At
    December 31, 2006, the call price was 101% of principal.
    The exchangeable debentures are exchangeable at the option of
    the holders at any time prior to maturity, unless previously
    redeemed, for shares of Chevron common stock. In lieu of
    delivering Chevron common stock to an exchanging debenture
    holder, Devon may, at its option, pay to such holder an amount
    of cash equal to the market value of the Chevron common stock.
    At maturity, holders who have not exercised their exchange
    rights will receive an amount in cash equal to the principal
    amount of the debentures.

As of December 31, 2006, Devon beneficially owned
    approximately 14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock.
    These shares have been deposited with an exchange agent for
    possible exchange for the

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exchangeable debentures. Each $1,000 principal amount of the
    exchangeable debentures is exchangeable into 18.6566 shares
    of Chevron common stock, an exchange rate equivalent to $53.60
    per share of Chevron stock.

The exchangeable debentures were assumed as part of the 1999
    PennzEnergy acquisition. As a result, the fair values of the
    exchangeable debentures were determined as of August 17,
    1999, based on market quotations. In accordance with derivative
    accounting standards, the total fair value of the debentures was
    allocated between the interest-bearing debt and the option to
    exchange Chevron common stock that is embedded in the
    debentures. Accordingly, a discount was recorded on the
    debentures and is being accreted using the effective interest
    method which raised the effective interest rate on the
    debentures to 7.76%.

Other
    Debentures and Notes

Following are descriptions of the various other debentures and
    notes outstanding at December 31, 2006, as listed in the
    table presented at the beginning of this note.

Ocean
    Debt

In connection with the 2003 Ocean merger, Devon assumed
    $1.8 billion of debt. The table below summarizes the debt
    assumed which remains outstanding, the fair value of the debt at
    April 25, 2003, and the effective interest rate of the debt
    assumed after determining the fair values of the respective
    notes using April 25, 2003, market interest rates. The
    premiums are being amortized using the effective interest
    method. All of the notes are general unsecured obligations of
    Devon.

The $400 million 4.375% senior notes due in October of

interest rate swap. Through the use of this swap, this
    fixed-rate debt has been converted to floating-rate debt bearing
    interest equal to LIBOR plus 40 basis points.

10.125% Debentures
    due November 15, 2009

These debentures were assumed as part of the PennzEnergy
    acquisition. The fair value of the debentures was determined
    using August 17, 1999, market interest rates. As a result,
    a premium was recorded on these debentures which lowered the
    effective interest rate to 8.9%. The premium is being amortized
    using the effective interest method.

6.875% Notes
    due September 30, 2011 and 7.875% Debentures due
    September 30, 2031

On October 3, 2001, Devon, through Devon Financing
    Corporation, U.L.C. (“Devon Financing”), sold these
    notes and debentures which are unsecured and unsubordinated
    obligations of Devon Financing. Devon has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated
    basis the obligations of Devon Financing under the debt
    securities. The proceeds from the issuance of these debt
    securities were used to fund a portion of the Anderson
    acquisition.

Interest based on debt outstanding decreased from 2004 to 2006
    primarily due to the net effect of debt repayments during 2005
    and 2006 partially offset by the effect of commercial paper
    borrowings during the last half of 2006.

During 2005, Devon redeemed its $400 million
    6.75% notes due March 15, 2011 and its zero coupon
    convertible senior debentures prior to their scheduled maturity
    dates. The other interest category in the table above includes
    $81 million in 2005 related to these early retirements.

During 2004, Devon repaid the balance under its $3 billion
    term loan credit facility prior to the scheduled repayment date.
    The other interest category in the table above includes
    $16 million in 2004 related to this early repayment.

Oil and gas price hedge agreements

— The fair
    values of the oil and gas price hedges were based on either
    (a) an internal discounted cash flow calculation,
    (b) quotes obtained from the counterparty to the hedge
    agreement or (c) quotes provided by brokers.

Interest rate swap agreements

— The fair values
    of the interest rate swaps are based on internal discounted cash
    flow calculations, using market quotes of future interest rates,
    or quotes obtained from counterparties.

Embedded option in exchangeable debentures

—
    The fair value of the embedded option is based on a quote
    obtained from a broker.

Debt

— The fair values of fixed-rate debt are
    based on quotes obtained from brokers or by discounting the
    principal and interest payments at rates available for debt of
    similar terms and maturity. The fair values of floating-rate
    debt are estimated to approximate the carrying amounts because
    the interest rates paid on such debt are generally set for
    periods of three months or less.

6.

Retirement
    Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
    and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
    Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for U.S. and
    Canadian employees meeting certain age and service requirements.
    Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
    employee’s years of service and compensation and are funded
    from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

Devon has a funding policy regarding the Qualified Plans such
    that it will contribute the amount of funds necessary so that
    the Qualified Plans’ assets will be approximately equal to
    the related accumulated benefit obligation. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of the Qualified
    Plans’ assets were $590 million and $533 million,
    respectively, which was $59 million and $37 million
    more, respectively, than the related accumulated benefit
    obligation. The actual amount of contributions required during
    future periods will depend on investment returns from the plan
    assets during the same period as well as changes in long-term
    interest rates.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
    employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
    by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
    are based on the employee’s years of service and
    compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
    established trusts to fund these plans’ benefit
    obligations. The total value of these trusts was
    $59 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005, and is
    included in non-current other assets in the consolidated balance
    sheets. For the remaining Supplemental Plans for which trusts
    have not been established, benefits are funded from Devon’s
    available cash and cash equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
    (“Postretirement Plans”) which provide benefits for
    substantially all U.S. employees. The Postretirement Plans
    provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and
    are, depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
    non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
    Plans are estimated based on future cost-sharing changes that
    are consistent with Devon’s expressed intent to increase,
    where possible, contributions from future retirees. Devon’s
    funding policy for the Postretirement Plans is to fund the
    benefits as they become payable with available cash and cash
    equivalents.

Devon uses a November 30 measurement date to value its
    pension and other postretirement benefits obligations. As
    described in Note 1, Devon will be required to use a
    December 31 measurement date beginning with the fiscal year
    ending December 31, 2008. Devon does not expect the change
    in its measurement date from November 30 to
    December 31 will have a material effect on the net periodic
    benefit cost or benefit obligation.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),

requires Devon
    to recognize on its consolidated balance sheet the funded status
    of its defined benefit plans. The funded status is measured as
    the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the
    fair value of plan assets. The following table presents the

    benefit obligation for pension plans represents the projected
    benefit obligation, while the benefit obligation for the
    postretirement benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit
    obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the
    projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no
    assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated
    benefit obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2006
    and 2005 was $652 million and $607 million,

Discount rate

— Future pension and
    postretirement obligations are discounted at the end of each
    year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively
    settled, considering the timing of estimated benefit payments.
    This rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after allowing
    for call and default risk. High quality corporate bond yield
    indices, such as Moody’s Aa, are considered when selecting
    the discount rate.

Rate of compensation increase

— For measurement
    of the 2006 benefit obligation for the pension plans, the 7%
    compensation increase in the table above represents the assumed
    increase for 2007 and 2008. The rate was assumed to decrease one
    percent annually to 5% in the year 2010 and remain at that level
    thereafter. For measurement of the 2005 and 2004 benefit
    obligations for the pension plans, the compensation increases in
    the table above represent the assumed increases for all future
    years.

Expected return on plan assets

— Devon’s
    overall investment objective for its retirement plans’
    assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested capital to
    ensure payments of retirement benefits obligations can be funded
    when required. To assist in achieving this objective, Devon has
    established certain investment strategies, including target
    allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments,
    designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. At
    December 31, 2006, the target investment allocation for
    Devon’s plan assets was 50% U.S. large cap equity
    securities; 15% U.S. small cap equity securities, equally
    allocated between growth and value; 15% international equity
    securities, equally allocated between growth and value; and 20%
    debt securities. Derivatives or other speculative investments
    considered high-risk are generally prohibited.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by
    evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. Devon expects the
    long-term asset allocation to approximate the targeted
    allocation. Therefore, the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is based on the target allocation of investment
    types in such assets.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset
    allocation for Devon’s pension plans at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the target allocation for 2007 by asset

Other assumptions

— For measurement of the
    benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans, a
    10% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
    health care benefits was assumed for 2007. The rate was assumed
    to decrease one percent annually to 5% in the year 2012 and
    remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost-trend
    rates affect the amounts reported for retiree health care costs.
    A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
    cost-trend rates would have the following effects on the
    December 31, 2006 other postretirement benefits obligation

    Plans and Postretirement Plans. Of the benefits expected to be
    paid in 2007, $7 million of pension benefits is expected to
    be funded from the trusts established for the Supplemental Plans
    and all $5 million of other postretirement benefits is
    expected to be funded from Devon’s available cash and cash
    equivalents. Expected employer contributions and benefit
    payments for other postretirement benefits are presented net of
    employee contributions.

Other
    Benefit Plans

Devon has a 401(k) Incentive Savings Plan which covers all
    domestic employees. At its discretion, Devon may match a certain
    percentage of the employees’ contributions to the plan. The
    matching percentage is determined annually by the Board of
    Directors. Devon’s matching contributions to the plan were
    $15 million, $12 million and $11 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
    employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee which is
    based upon the employee’s base compensation and
    classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
    amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
    has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
    plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
    employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
    percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
    additional Devon contributions. During 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    Devon’s combined

    be issued in one or more series, and the terms and rights of
    such stock will be determined by the Board of Directors.

Effective August 17, 1999, Devon issued 1.5 million
    shares of 6.49% cumulative preferred stock, Series A, to
    holders of PennzEnergy 6.49% cumulative preferred stock,
    Series A. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative
    from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly, in
    cash, when declared by the Board of Directors. The preferred
    stock is redeemable at the option of Devon at any time on or
    after June 2, 2008, in whole or in part, at a redemption
    price of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends
    to the redemption date.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated a certain number
    of shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock”) in connection with the adoption of the
    shareholder rights plan described later in this note. On
    April 25, 2003, the Board increased the designated shares
    from 2.0 million to 2.9 million. At December 31,
    2006, there were no shares of Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock issued or outstanding. The Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock is entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends per
    share equal to the greater of $1.00 or 200 times the aggregate
    per share amount of all dividends (other than stock dividends)
    declared on common stock since the immediately preceding
    quarterly dividend payment date or, with respect to the first
    payment date, since the first issuance of Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series A Junior Preferred
    Stock are entitled to 200 votes per share (subject to adjustment
    to prevent dilution) on all matters submitted to a vote of the
    stockholders. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock is
    neither redeemable nor convertible. The Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock ranks prior to the common stock but junior to
    all other classes of Preferred Stock.

At December 31, 2003, a subsidiary of Devon created in the
    Ocean merger had 38,000 shares of convertible preferred
    stock outstanding. In January 2004, these shares of convertible
    preferred stock were canceled and converted to
    2,197,160 shares of Devon common stock pursuant to an
    automatic conversion feature of the preferred stock. The
    automatic conversion feature was triggered when the closing
    price of Devon common stock equaled or exceeded the forced
    conversion price of $26.20 for 20 consecutive trading days.

Stock
    Repurchases

On September 27, 2004, Devon announced a stock repurchase
    program to repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common
    stock. During 2004, Devon repurchased five million shares at a
    total cost of $189 million, or $37.78 per share. This
    program was completed in 2005, during which Devon repurchased
    44.6 million shares at a total cost of $2.1 billion,
    or $47.69 per share. The total cost of this program was
    $2.3 billion, or $46.69 per share.

On August 3, 2005, Devon announced another program to
    repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common. During
    2005, Devon repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of
    $134 million, or $60.16 per share, under this program.
    During 2006, Devon repurchased 4.3 million shares at a cost
    of $253 million, or $59.61 per share, under this program.
    As of February 1, 2007, Devon has repurchased
    6.5 million shares under this program for
    $387 million, or $59.80 per share. This program was
    suspended in 2006 as a result of the Chief acquisition (see
    Note 3). In conjunction with the sales of Egypt and West
    Africa (see Note 13), Devon expects to resume this
    repurchase program in late 2007 by using a portion of the sale
    proceeds to repurchase common stock. Although this program
    expires at the end of 2007, it could be extended if necessary.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

Under Devon’s shareholder rights plan, stockholders have
    one half of one right for each share of common stock held. The
    rights become exercisable and separately transferable ten
    business days after (a) an announcement that a person has
    acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
    voting shares outstanding, or (b) commencement of a tender
    or exchange offer that could result in a person owning 15% or
    more of the voting shares outstanding.

Each right entitles its holder (except a holder who is the
    acquiring person) to purchase either (a) 1/100 of a share
    of Series A Preferred Stock for $185.00, subject to
    adjustment or, (b) Devon common stock with a value equal to
    twice the exercise price of the right, subject to adjustment to
    prevent dilution. In the event of certain merger or asset sale
    transactions with another party or transactions which would
    increase the equity ownership of a shareholder who then owned
    15% or more of Devon, each Devon right will entitle its holder
    to purchase securities of the merging or acquiring party with a
    value equal to twice the exercise price of the right.

The rights, which have no voting power, expire on
    August 17, 2009. The rights may be redeemed by Devon for
    $0.01 per right until the rights become exercisable.

Dividends

Dividends on Devon’s common stock were paid in 2006, 2005
    and 2004 at a per share rate of $0.1125, $0.075 and
    $0.05 per quarter, respectively.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
    course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
    outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
    accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
    matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters
    and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
    similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management
    to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s
    financial position or results of operations after consideration
    of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ
    materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental
    Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
    environmental remediation activities associated with past
    operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
    state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these
    activities, accruals have been established when reasonable
    estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include
    estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used
    discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for
    environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible
    recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to
    environmental costs have been recognized in Devon’s
    consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals
    when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
    probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation
    estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of Devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers
    are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
    subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
    (“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
    with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
    by third parties. As of December 31, 2006, Devon’s
    consolidated balance sheet included $5 million of
    non-current accrued liabilities, reflected in “Other
    liabilities,” related to these and other environmental
    remediation liabilities. Devon does not currently believe there
    is a reasonable possibility of incurring additional material
    costs in excess of the current accruals recognized for such
    environmental remediation activities. With respect to the sites
    in which Devon subsidiaries



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are PRPs, Devon’s conclusion is based in large part on
    (i) Devon’s participation in consent decrees with both
    other PRPs and the Environmental Protection Agency, which
    provide for performing the scope of work required for
    remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to
    the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as a

de minimis
    PRP

, and (iii) the availability of other defenses to
    liability. As a result, Devon’s monetary exposure is not
    expected to be material.

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous gas producers and related parties, including Devon,
    have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the
    federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers
    and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and
    sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The
    principal suit in which Devon is a defendant is United States ex
    rel. Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. (the
    “Wright case”). The suit was originally filed in
    August 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
    District of Texas, but was consolidated in October 2000 with the
    other suits for pre-trial proceedings in the United States
    District Court for the District of Wyoming. On July 10,
    2003, the District of Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to
    the Eastern District of Texas to resume proceedings. Trial is
    set for November 2007. Devon believes that it has acted
    reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all
    allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties in good faith.
    Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material
    exposure in association with this lawsuit and no liability has
    been recorded in connection therewith.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act. The intent of this legislation was to
    encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico by
    providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain
    federal leases. Deep water leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) have contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or
    natural gas exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty
    relief would not be granted for that year. Deep water leases
    issued in 1998 and 1999 did not include price thresholds. The
    MMS in 2006 informed Devon and other oil and gas companies that
    the omission of price thresholds from these leases was an error
    on its part and was not its intention. Accordingly, the MMS
    invited Devon and the other affected oil and gas producers to
    renegotiate the terms and conditions of the 1998 and 1999 leases
    to add price threshold provisions to the lease agreements for
    periods after October 1, 2006. Devon has since had several
    discussions with MMS representatives on this issue, but has not
    yet entered into renegotiated leases.

The U.S. House of Representatives in January 2007 passed
    legislation that would require companies to renegotiate the 1998
    and 1999 leases as a condition of securing future federal
    leases. If this legislation were to become law, it would require
    price thresholds to be effective in the renegotiated 1998 and
    1999 leases effective October 1, 2006. Although Devon has
    not yet signed renegotiated leases, it has accrued in its 2006
    consolidated financial statements approximately $6 million
    for royalties that would be due if price thresholds were added
    to its 1998 and 1999 leases effective October 1, 2006.

Equatorial
    Guinea Investigation

The SEC has been conducting an inquiry into payments made to the
    government of Equatorial Guinea and to officials and persons
    affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial
    Guinea. On August 9, 2005, Devon received a subpoena issued
    by the SEC pursuant to a formal order of investigation. Devon
    has cooperated fully with the SEC’s requests for
    information in this inquiry. After responding in 2005 to such
    requests for information, Devon has not been contacted by the
    SEC. In the event that Devon receives any further inquiries,
    Devon will work with the SEC in connection with its
    investigation.

Hurricane
    Contingencies

Historically, Devon maintained a comprehensive insurance program
    that included coverage for physical damage to its offshore
    facilities caused by hurricanes. Devon’s historical
    insurance program also included substantial business
    interruption coverage which Devon is utilizing to recover costs
    associated with the suspended production related to hurricanes
    that struck the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter of 2005.
    Under the terms of this insurance program, Devon was entitled to
    be reimbursed for the portion of production suspended longer
    than forty-five days, subject to upper limits to oil and natural
    gas prices. Also, the terms of the insurance include a standard,
    per-event deductible of $1 million for offshore losses as
    well as a $15 million aggregate annual deductible.

Based on current estimates of physical damage and the
    anticipated length of time Devon will have production suspended,
    Devon expects its policy recoveries will exceed repair costs and
    deductible amounts. This expectation is based upon several
    variables, including the $467 million received in the third
    quarter of 2006 as a full settlement of the amount due from
    Devon’s primary insurers. As of December 31, 2006,
    $154 million of these proceeds had been utilized as
    reimbursement of past repair costs and deductible amounts. The
    remaining proceeds of $313 million will be utilized as
    reimbursement of Devon’s anticipated future repair costs.
    Devon has not yet received any settlements related to claims
    filed with its secondary insurers.

Should Devon’s total policy recoveries, including the
    partial settlements already received from Devon’s primary
    insurers, exceed all repair costs and deductible amounts, such
    excess will be recognized as other income in the statement of
    operations in the period in which such determination can be made.

The policy underlying the insurance program terms described
    above expired on August 31, 2006. During the third quarter
    of 2006, Devon was able to re-establish a comprehensive
    insurance program that includes business interruption and
    physical damage coverage for its business. However, due to
    significant changes in the marketplace, Devon was only able to
    obtain a

de minimis

amount of coverage for any damage
    that may be caused by named windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.
    Devon has not experienced any losses under this new insurance
    arrangement through December 31, 2006.

Other
    Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge
    as of the date of this report, there were no other material
    pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which
    any of its property is subject.

Commitments

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under
    contractual agreements with third party service providers to
    procure drilling rigs and other related services for
    developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities
    construction. Included in the $3.0 billion total of
    “Drilling and Facility Obligations” in the table below
    is $1.9 billion which relates to long-term contracts for
    three deepwater drilling rigs and certain other contracts for
    onshore drilling and facility obligations in which drilling or
    facilities construction has not commenced. The $1.9 billion
    represents the gross commitment under these contracts.
    Devon’s ultimate payment for these commitments will be
    reduced by the amounts billed to its partners when net working
    interests are ultimately determined. Payments for these
    commitments, net of amounts billed to partners, will be
    capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties.

Devon has certain firm transportation agreements which represent
    “ship or pay” arrangements whereby Devon has committed
    to ship certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed
    transportation fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to
    aid the movement of its production to market. Devon expects to
    have sufficient production to utilize the majority of these
    transportation services.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
    lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
    administrative expenses under operating leases, net of

sub-lease

income, was $36 million, $35 million and
    $49 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003
    Ocean merger. The spars are being used in the development of the
    Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Boomvang
    field was divested as part of the 2005 property divestiture
    program. The Nansen operating lease is for a

20-year

term
    and contains various options whereby Devon may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spar. Total rental expense
    included in lease operating expenses under both the Nansen and
    Boomvang operating leases was $12 million, $14 million
    and $17 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Devon
    has guaranteed that the Nansen spar will have a residual value
    at the end of the operating lease equal to at least 10% of the
    fair value of the spar at the inception of the lease. The total
    guaranteed value is $14 million in 2022. However, such
    amount may be reduced under the terms of the lease agreement. As
    a result of the sale of the Boomvang field, Devon is subleasing
    the Boomvang Spar. If the sublessee were to default on its
    obligation, Devon would continue to be obligated to pay the
    periodic lease payments and any guaranteed value required at the
    end of the term.

Devon has a floating, production, storage and offloading
    facility (“FPSO”) that is being used in the Panyu
    project offshore China and is being leased under operating lease
    arrangements. This lease expires in September 2009. Devon
    was also leasing an FPSO that is being used in the Zafiro field
    offshore Equatorial Guinea. Devon and the other working interest
    owners purchased this FPSO in the fourth quarter of 2005. Total
    rental expense included in lease operating expenses under both
    the China and Equatorial Guinea operating leases was
    $9 million, $19 million and $20 million in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum payments

Share-Based
    Compensation

On June 8, 2005, Devon’s stockholders adopted the 2005
    Long-Term Incentive Plan which expires on June 8, 2013.
    Devon’s stockholders adopted certain amendments to this
    plan on June 7, 2006. This plan, as amended, authorizes the
    Compensation Committee, which consists of non-management members
    of Devon’s Board of Directors, to grant nonqualified and
    incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, Canadian
    restricted stock units, performance units, performance bonuses,
    stock appreciation rights and cash-out rights to eligible
    employees. The plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified
    stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation
    rights to directors. A total of 32 million shares of Devon
    common stock have been



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reserved for issuance pursuant to the plan. To calculate shares
    issued under the plan, options granted represent one share and
    other awards represent 2.2 shares.

Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2003 and
    1997 under which stock options and restricted stock awards were
    issued to key management and professional employees. Options
    granted under these plans remain exercisable by the employees
    owning such options, but no new options or restricted stock
    awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has stock
    options outstanding that were assumed as part of the
    acquisitions of Ocean, Mitchell Energy & Development
    Corp., Santa Fe Snyder and PennzEnergy.

As discussed in Note 1, on January 1, 2006, Devon
    changed its method of accounting for share-based compensation
    from the APB No. 25 intrinsic value accounting method to
    the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). The following table presents the
    effects of share-based compensation included in Devon’s

Stock
    Options

Under Devon’s 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options granted may not be less than the
    estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
    In addition, options granted are exercisable during a period
    established for each grant, which period may not exceed eight
    years from the date of grant. The recipient must pay the
    exercise price in cash or in common stock, or a combination
    thereof, at the time that the option is exercised. Options
    granted generally have a vesting period that ranges from three
    to four years.

The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed
    over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the fair
    values of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model, which requires Devon to make several
    assumptions. The volatility of Devon’s common stock is
    based on the historical volatility of the market price of
    Devon’s common stock over a period of time equal to the
    expected term of the option and ending on the grant date. The
    dividend yield is based on Devon’s historical and current
    yield in effect at the date of grant. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield for
    the expected term of the option at the date of grant. The
    expected term of the options is based on historical exercise and
    termination experience for various groups of employees and
    directors. Each group is determined based on the similarity of
    their historical exercise and termination behavior.

The following table presents a summary of the grant-date fair
    values of stock options granted and the related assumptions for
    the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. All such
    amounts represent the weighted-average amounts for each year.

Restricted
    Stock Awards and Units

Under Devon’s 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, restricted
    stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions,
    restrictions

and/or

limitations, if any, that the Compensation Committee deems
    appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment.
    Generally, restricted stock awards and units vest over a minimum
    restriction period of at least three years from the date of
    grant. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted stock
    awards receive dividends which are not subject to restrictions
    or other limitations. The fair value of restricted stock awards
    and units on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable
    vesting period. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted
    stock awards and units as the closing price of Devon’s
    common stock on the grant date of the award or unit.

Devon has committed to drill four wells in Nigeria. The first
    two wells were unsuccessful. After drilling the second
    unsuccessful well in the first quarter of 2006, Devon determined
    that the capitalized costs related to these two wells should be
    impaired. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, Devon
    recognized an $85 million impairment of its investment in
    Nigeria equal to the costs to drill the two dry holes and a
    proportionate share of block-related costs. There was no tax
    benefit related to this impairment.

During the second quarter of 2006, Devon drilled two
    unsuccessful exploratory wells in Brazil and determined that the
    capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired.
    Therefore, in the second quarter of 2006, Devon recognized a
    $16 million impairment of its investment in Brazil equal to
    the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share
    of block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related to this
    impairment. The two wells were unrelated to Devon’s Polvo
    development project in Brazil.

As a result of a decline in projected future net cash flows, the
    carrying value of Devon’s Russian properties exceeded the
    full cost ceiling by $10 million at the end of the third
    quarter of 2006. Therefore, Devon recognized a $20 million
    reduction of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties in
    Russia, offset by a $10 million deferred income tax benefit.

    Reductions

Devon’s interests in Angola were acquired through the 2003
    Ocean Energy merger. Devon’s Angolan drilling program
    discovered no proven reserves. After drilling three unsuccessful
    wells in the fourth quarter of 2005, Devon determined that all
    of the Angolan capitalized costs should be impaired.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, Devon was capitalizing the
    costs of previous unsuccessful efforts in Brazil pending the
    determination of whether proved reserves would be recorded in
    Brazil. Devon has been successful in its drilling efforts on
    block BM-C-8 in Brazil and is currently developing the Polvo
    project on this block. The ultimate value of the Polvo project
    is expected to be in excess of the sum of its related costs,
    plus the costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts in
    Brazil which were capitalized. However, the Polvo proved
    reserves will be recorded over a period of time. At the end of
    2005, it was expected that a small

initial portion of the proved reserves ultimately expected at
    Polvo would be recorded in 2006. Based on preliminary estimates
    developed in the fourth quarter of 2005, the value of this
    initial partial booking of proved reserves was not sufficient to
    offset the sum of the related proportionate Polvo costs plus the
    costs of the previous unrelated unsuccessful efforts. Therefore,
    Devon determined that the prior unsuccessful costs unrelated to
    the Polvo project should be impaired. These costs totaled
    approximately $42 million. There was no tax benefit related
    to this Brazilian impairment.

Income
    Taxes

At December 31, 2006, Devon had the following net operating
    loss carryforwards which are available to reduce future taxable
    income in the jurisdiction where the net operating loss was
    incurred. These carryforwards will result in a future tax
    reduction based upon the future tax rate applicable to the
    taxable income that is ultimately offset by the net operating
    loss carryforward. For financial purposes, the tax effects of
    these carryforwards have been recognized as reductions to the
    net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2006.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, deferred income taxes were reduced
    $243 million, $14 million and $36 million,
    respectively, due to Canadian statutory rate reductions that
    were enacted in each such year.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2006 and 2005, income taxes were reduced $12 million and
    $25 million, respectively, due to a new U.S. tax
    deduction for companies with domestic production activities,
    including oil and gas extraction.

In 2006, deferred income taxes increased $39 million due to
    the effect of a new income-based tax enacted by the state of
    Texas that replaces a previous franchise tax. The new tax is
    effective January 1, 2007. The $39 million increase is
    included in 2006 state income taxes in the above table.

In 2005, Devon recognized $28 million of taxes related to
    its repatriation of $545 million to the U.S. The cash
    was repatriated due to tax legislation that allowed qualifying
    companies to repatriate cash from foreign operations at a
    reduced income tax rate. Substantially all of the cash
    repatriated by Devon in 2005 related to earnings of its Canadian
    subsidiary.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to
    significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are presented below:

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
    $704 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
    2006. Such amount includes $35 million from various
    carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The
    carryforwards include state net operating loss carryforwards
    which expire primarily between 2007 and 2022, Canadian net
    operating loss carryforwards which expire primarily between 2008
    and 2027, and Brazilian net operating loss carryforwards which
    have no expiration. The tax benefits of carryforwards are
    recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the
    utilization of such carryforwards to be “more likely than
    not.” When the future utilization of some portion of the
    carryforwards is determined not to be “more likely than
    not,” a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the
    recorded tax benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the net operating loss
    carryforwards to be utilized between 2007 and 2010. Such
    expectation is based upon current estimates of taxable income
    during this period, considering limitations on the annual
    utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax regulations.
    Significant changes in



DEVON

NOTES TO

such estimates caused by variables such as future oil and gas
    prices or capital expenditures could alter the timing of the
    eventual utilization of such carryforwards. There can be no
    assurance that Devon will generate any specific level of
    continuing taxable earnings. However, management believes that
    Devon’s future taxable income will more likely than not be
    sufficient to utilize substantially all its tax carryforwards
    prior to their expiration.

Pursuant to the full cost method of accounting, Devon
    capitalizes certain of its general and administrative expenses
    which are related to property acquisition, exploration and
    development activities. Such capitalized expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $269 million, $181 million and $166 million in
    the years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Also, Devon
    capitalizes interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved
    oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and
    gas properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $70 million in each of the years 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Results
    of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities

The following tables include revenues and expenses associated
    directly with Devon’s oil and gas producing activities,
    including general and administrative expenses directly related
    to such producing activities. They do not include any allocation
    of Devon’s interest costs or general corporate overhead
    and, therefore, are not necessarily indicative of the
    contribution to net earnings of Devon’s oil and gas
    operations. Income tax expense has been calculated by applying
    statutory income tax rates to oil, gas and NGL sales after
    deducting costs, including depreciation, depletion and
    amortization and after giving effect to permanent differences.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Canadian income tax amounts in the
    tables above were reduced by $243 million, $14 million
    and $36 million, respectively, due to statutory rate
    reductions that were enacted in each such year.

Quantities
    of Oil and Gas Reserves

Set forth below is a summary of the reserves which were
    evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    which were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of revenues
    which were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

The domestic reserves were evaluated by the independent
    petroleum consultants of LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and
    Ryder Scott Company, L.P. in each of the years presented. The
    Canadian reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum
    consultants of AJM Petroleum Consultants in each of the years
    presented. The International reserves were evaluated by the
    independent petroleum consultants of Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    in each of the years presented.

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices
    (averaging $46.11 per barrel of oil, $5.06 per Mcf of
    gas and $27.63 per barrel of natural gas liquids at
    December 31, 2006) to the year-end quantities of
    proved reserves, except in those instances where fixed and
    determinable price changes are provided by contractual
    arrangements in existence at year-end.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Future development and production costs are computed by
    estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
    producing proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year,
    based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing
    economic conditions. Of the $8.5 billion of future
    development costs, $2.2 billion, $1.5 billion and
    $0.9 billion are estimated to be spent in 2007, 2008 and
    2009, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
    also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
    Included as part of the $8.5 billion of future development
    costs are $1.7 billion of future dismantlement, abandonment
    and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
    expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
    Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
    appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
    flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
    properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
    to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
    impact of future operations.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
    that material information relating to Devon, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
    certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
    senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
    principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective
    as of December 31, 2006 to ensure that the information
    required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files
    or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for Devon, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision
    and with the participation of Devon’s management, including
    our principal executive and principal financial officers, Devon
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this
    evaluation under the COSO Framework which was completed on
    February 12, 2007, management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    Devon’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm who audited
    Devon’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, as stated in their report
    which is included herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting that Devon Energy Corporation
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Devon Energy Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Devon Energy
    Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Devon Energy Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
    income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and
    our report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Our report
    refers to a change in the method of accounting for share-based
    payments and a change in the balance sheet recognition of
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
