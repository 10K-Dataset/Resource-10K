PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Devon Energy Corporation, including its subsidiaries
    (“Devon”), is an independent energy company engaged
    primarily in oil and gas exploration, development and
    production, the transportation of oil, gas, and NGLs and the
    processing of natural gas. We own oil and gas properties
    principally in the United States and Canada and, to a lesser
    degree, various regions located outside North America, including
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. In addition to our oil and gas
    operations, we have marketing and midstream operations primarily
    in North America. These include marketing gas, crude oil and
    NGLs, and constructing and operating pipelines, storage and
    treating facilities and natural gas processing plants. A
    detailed description of our significant properties and
    associated 2008 developments can be found under
    “Item 2. Properties.”

We began operations in 1971 as a privately held company. In
    1988, our common stock began trading publicly on the American
    Stock Exchange under the symbol “DVN”. In October
    2004, we transferred our common stock listing to the New York
    Stock Exchange. Our principal and administrative offices are
    located at 20 North Broadway, Oklahoma City, OK

73102-8260

(telephone 405/235-3611).

Strategy

We have a two-pronged operating strategy. First, we invest a
    significant portion of our capital budget in low-risk
    development projects on our extensive North American property
    base, which provides reliable and repeatable production and
    reserves additions. To supplement that low-risk part of our
    strategy, we also annually invest capital in long cycle-time
    projects to replenish our development inventory for the future.
    The philosophy that underlies the execution of this strategy is
    to strive to increase value on a per share basis by:

•

building oil and gas reserves and production;

•

exercising capital discipline;

•

controlling operating costs;

•

improving performance through our marketing and midstream
    operations; and

•

preserving financial flexibility.

Development
    of Business

During 1988, we expanded our capital base with our first
    issuance of common stock to the public. This transaction began a
    substantial expansion program that has continued through the
    subsequent years. This expansion is attributable to both a
    focused mergers and acquisitions program spanning a number of
    years and an active ongoing exploration and development drilling
    program. We have increased our total proved reserves from
    8 MMBoe


at year-end 1987 to 2,428 MMBoe at year-end 2008.

During the same time period, we have grown proved reserves from
    0.66 Boe


per diluted share at the end of 1987 to 5.44 Boe per diluted
    share at the end of 2008. This represents a compound annual
    growth rate of 11%. We have also increased production from 0.09
    Boe


per

    diluted share in 1987 to 0.53 Boe per diluted share in 2008, for
    a compound annual growth rate of 9%. This per share growth is a
    direct result of successful execution of our strategic plan and
    other key transactions and events.

We achieved a number of significant accomplishments in our
    operations during 2008, including those discussed below.

•

Drilling Success —

We drilled a record
    2,441 gross wells with an overall 98% rate of success. As a
    result of our success with the drill-bit, we replaced
    approximately 245% of our 2008 production. We


Excludes

    the effects of mergers in 1998 and 2000 that were accounted for
    as poolings of interests.



added 584 MMBoe of proved reserves during the year with
    extensions, discoveries and performance revisions, a total which
    was well in excess of the 238 MMBoe we produced during the
    year. Consistent with our two-pronged operating strategy, 93% of
    the wells we drilled were North American development wells,
    which was the main driver behind our 6% increase in production
    in 2008.

•

Barnett Shale Growth —

We continue to retain
    our positions as the largest producer and largest lease holder
    in the Barnett Shale area of north Texas. We increased our
    production from the Barnett Shale area by 31% in 2008, exiting
    the year at 1.2 Bcfe per day net to our ownership interest.
    We drilled 659 wells in the Barnett Shale in 2008. We have
    interests in approximately 3,800 producing wells in the Barnett
    Shale and hold approximately 715,000 net acres of Barnett
    Shale leases. At December 31, 2008, we had estimated proved
    reserves of 894 MMBoe in the Barnett Shale area.

•

U.S. Onshore Production and Reserves Growth —

Our U.S. onshore properties, including the Barnett
    Shale, the Groesbeck and Carthage areas in east Texas, the
    Washakie basin in Wyoming and the Woodford Shale area in
    Oklahoma, showed strong production growth in 2008. These four
    areas, which accounted for approximately 69% of our
    U.S. onshore production, had production growth in 2008 of
    26% compared to 2007.

We also completed construction and commenced operation of our
    Northridge natural gas processing plant in southeastern
    Oklahoma. This plant can process up to 200 MMcf of natural
    gas per day and will support our growing production in the
    Woodford Shale.

We have also leveraged our knowledge of and expertise in the
    Barnett Shale into other unconventional natural gas plays, such
    as the Haynesville shale in eastern Texas and western Louisiana,
    the Cana shale play in western Oklahoma and the Cody play in
    Montana. We added approximately 800,000 net undeveloped
    acres to our lease inventory, positioning us with more than
    1.4 million net acres in emerging unconventional natural
    gas plays.

In addition to production growth, our U.S. onshore
    properties also demonstrated measurable growth in proved
    reserves. U.S. onshore proved reserves grew 416 MMBoe
    due to extensions, discoveries and performance revisions. This
    was almost three times our U.S. onshore production in 2008
    of 146 MMBoe. Our drilling activities increased our 2008
    U.S. onshore proved reserves by 27% compared to the end of
    2007.

•

Marketing and Midstream

— Our marketing and
    midstream business delivered another record setting year with
    operating profit increasing by 31% to $668 million.

•

Jackfish —

We ramped up production from our
    100%-owned Jackfish thermal heavy oil project in the Alberta oil
    sands to 22,000 Bbls per day by the end of the year. In
    2009, we expect to achieve our peak production target of
    35,000 Bbls per day. Additionally, we received regulatory
    approval for the second phase of Jackfish. Like the first phase,
    this second phase of Jackfish is also expected to eventually
    produce 35,000 Bbls per day.

•

Lloydminster —

Also in Canada, we increased
    production from the Lloydminster heavy oil play in Alberta by
    14%, exiting the year at approximately 45,000 Boe per day. We
    drilled 425 wells at Lloydminster in 2008, which added
    19 MMBoe of proved reserves.

•

Divestiture of African Properties —

We
    substantially completed our Egypt and West Africa divestiture
    programs. We have now sold all of our oil and gas producing
    properties in Africa. These divestitures generated just over
    $3.0 billion of sales proceeds. After income taxes and
    purchase price adjustments, such proceeds totaled
    $2.2 billion and generated after-tax gains of
    $0.8 billion.

Pursuant to accounting rules for discontinued operations, the
    amounts in this document related to continuing operations for
    2008 and all prior years presented do not include amounts
    related to our operations in Egypt and West Africa.

•

Polvo —

We experienced numerous mechanical
    issues with our offshore development project that delayed our
    expected production growth. By the end of 2008, we had solved
    the mechanical issues and



are now producing at 17,000 Bbls per day. We expect
    production to increase in 2009. We have a 60% working interest
    in Polvo.

•

Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Development —

We
    continued to build off prior years’ successful drilling
    results with our deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration and
    development program. To date, we have drilled four discovery
    wells in the Lower Tertiary trend — Cascade in 2002
    (50% working interest), St. Malo in 2003 (25% working interest),
    Jack in 2004 (25% working interest) and Kaskida in 2006 (30%
    working interest). These achievements, along with our 2008
    developments discussed below, support our positive view of the
    Lower Tertiary and demonstrate the potential of our exploration
    strategy on growth of long-term production, reserves and value.

Specific Gulf of Mexico developments in 2008 included the
    following:

•

At Cascade, we commenced drilling the first of two initial
    producing wells and continued work on the production facilities
    and subsea equipment. We anticipate first production at Cascade
    in 2010. When Cascade begins producing, it will utilize the
    Gulf’s first FPSO.

•

At Jack and St. Malo, our partners focused on development
    concepts for the two fields. Particular consideration has been
    given to joint development of the two fields that could employ
    the use of a single, semi-submersible production facility.

•

At Kaskida, the largest of our Lower Tertiary discoveries, we
    are currently drilling an appraisal well.

Financial
    Information about Segments and Geographical Areas

Notes 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements
    included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” of this report contain information on
    our segments and geographical areas.

Oil,
    Natural Gas and NGL Marketing

The spot markets for oil, gas and NGLs are subject to volatility
    as supply and demand factors fluctuate. As detailed below, we
    sell our production under both long-term (one year or more) or
    short-term (less than one year) agreements. Regardless of the
    term of the contract, the vast majority of our production is
    sold at variable or market sensitive prices.

Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging
    arrangements, fixed-price contracts or firm delivery commitments
    with a portion of our oil and gas production. These activities
    are intended to support targeted price levels and to manage our
    exposure to price fluctuations. See “Item 7A.
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Oil
    Marketing

Our oil production is sold under both long-term (one year or
    more) and short-term (less than one year) agreements at prices
    negotiated with third parties. As of February 2009, all of our
    oil production was sold at variable or market-sensitive prices.

Natural
    Gas Marketing

Our gas production is also sold under both long-term and
    short-term agreements at prices negotiated with third parties.
    Although exact percentages vary daily, as of February 2009,
    approximately 75% of our gas production was sold under
    short-term contracts at variable or market-sensitive prices.
    These market-sensitive sales are referred to as “spot
    market” sales. Another 24% of our production was committed
    under various long-term contracts, which dedicate the gas to a
    purchaser for an extended period of time, but still at market
    sensitive prices. The remaining 1% of our gas production was
    sold under long-term, fixed-price contracts.



NGL
    Marketing

Our NGL production is sold under both long-term and short-term
    agreements at prices negotiated with third parties. Although
    exact percentages vary, as of February 2009, approximately 97%
    of our NGL production was sold under short-term contracts at
    variable or market-sensitive prices. The remaining NGL
    production is sold under long-term, market-indexed contracts
    which are subject to market pricing variations.

Marketing
    and Midstream Activities

The primary objective of our marketing and midstream operations
    is to add value to us and other producers to whom we provide
    such services by gathering, processing and marketing oil, gas
    and NGL production in a timely and efficient manner. Our most
    significant midstream asset is the Bridgeport processing plant
    and gathering system located in north Texas. These facilities
    serve not only our gas production from the Barnett Shale but
    also gas production of other producers in the area. Our
    midstream assets also include our 50% interest in the Access
    Pipeline transportation system in Canada. This pipeline system
    allows us to blend our Jackfish heavy oil production with
    condensate and then transport the combined product to the
    Edmonton area for sale.

Our marketing and midstream revenues are primarily generated by:

•

selling NGLs that are either extracted from the gas streams
    processed by our plants or purchased from third parties for
    marketing, and

•

selling or gathering gas that moves through our transport
    pipelines and unrelated third-party pipelines.

Our marketing and midstream costs and expenses are primarily
    incurred from:

•

purchasing the gas streams entering our transport pipelines and
    plants;

•

purchasing fuel needed to operate our plants, compressors and
    related pipeline facilities;

•

purchasing third-party NGLs;

•

operating our plants, gathering systems and related
    facilities; and

•

transporting products on unrelated third-party pipelines.

Customers

We sell our gas production to a variety of customers including
    pipelines, utilities, gas marketing firms, industrial users and
    local distribution companies. Gathering systems and interstate
    and intrastate pipelines are used to consummate gas sales and
    deliveries.

The principal customers for our crude oil production are
    refiners, remarketers and other companies, some of which have
    pipeline facilities near the producing properties. In the event
    pipeline facilities are not conveniently available, crude oil is
    trucked or shipped to storage, refining or pipeline facilities.

Our NGL production is primarily sold to customers engaged in
    petrochemical, refining and heavy oil blending activities.
    Pipelines, railcars and trucks are utilized to move our products
    to market.

No purchaser accounted for over 10% of our revenues in 2008,
    2007 or 2006.

Seasonal
    Nature of Business

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases
    during the summer months and increases during the winter months.
    Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes
    lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities,
    local distribution companies and industrial users utilize
    natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their
    anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also
    lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.



Government
    Regulation

The oil and gas industry is subject to various types of
    regulation throughout the world. Legislation affecting the oil
    and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review
    for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to this legislation,
    numerous government agencies have issued extensive laws and
    regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
    individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
    for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a
    significant impact on oil and gas exploration, production and
    marketing and midstream activities. These laws and regulations
    increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect
    profitability. Because new legislation affecting the oil and gas
    industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are
    frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict
    the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and
    regulations. However, we do not expect that any of these laws
    and regulations will affect our operations in a manner
    materially different than they would affect other oil and gas
    companies of similar size and financial strength.

The following are significant areas of government control and
    regulation in the United States, Canada and other international
    locations in which we operate.

Exploration
    and Production Regulation

Our oil and gas operations are subject to various federal,
    state, provincial, tribal, local and international laws and
    regulations, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations
    related to the acquisition of seismic data; the location of
    wells; drilling and casing of wells; well production; spill
    prevention plans; emissions permitting; the use, transportation,
    storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil
    and gas operations; surface usage and the restoration of
    properties upon which wells have been drilled; the calculation
    and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes; the
    plugging and abandoning of wells; the transportation of
    production; and, in international operations, minimum
    investments in the country of operations.

Our operations are also subject to conservation regulations,
    including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing
    units or proration units; the number of wells that may be
    drilled in a unit; the rate of production allowable from oil and
    gas wells; and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas
    properties. In the United States, some states allow the forced
    pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration,
    while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and
    leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas
    properties. In addition, state conservation laws generally limit
    the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain
    requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The
    effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and
    gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of
    wells or the locations at which we can drill.

Certain of our U.S. oil and gas leases are granted by the
    federal government and administered by various federal agencies,
    including the Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals
    Management Service (“MMS”) of the Department of the
    Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal
    regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters,
    drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases, and
    calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal
    government. The MMS has been particularly active in recent years
    in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and
    regulations regarding competitive lease bidding and royalty
    payment obligations for production from federal lands. The
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also has jurisdiction over
    certain U.S. offshore activities pursuant to the Outer
    Continental Shelf Lands Act.

Royalties
    and Incentives in Canada

The royalty system in Canada is a significant factor in the
    profitability of oil and gas production. Royalties payable on
    production from lands other than Crown lands are determined by
    negotiations between the parties. Crown royalties are determined
    by government regulation and are generally calculated as a
    percentage of the value of the gross production, with the
    royalty rate dependent in part upon prescribed reference prices,
    well productivity, geographical location, field discovery date
    and the type and quality of the petroleum product produced. From
    time to time, the federal and provincial governments of Canada
    have also



established incentive programs such as royalty rate reductions,
    royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging
    oil and gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects. These
    incentives generally have the effect of increasing our revenues,
    earnings and cash flow.

In December 2008, the provincial government of Alberta enacted a
    new royalty regime. The new regime provides for new royalties
    for conventional oil, gas, NGL and bitumen production effective
    January 1, 2009. The royalties are linked to price and
    production levels and apply to both new and existing
    conventional oil and gas activities and oil sands projects.

This royalty regime reduced our proved reserves as of
    December 31, 2008 by 28 MMBoe. Additionally, this
    regime is expected to reduce future earnings and cash flows from
    our oil and gas properties located in Alberta. The actual effect
    on our future earnings and cash flows of this royalty regime
    will be determined based on, among other things, our production
    rates from wells in Alberta, the proportion of our Alberta
    production to our overall production, our product mix in
    Alberta, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates.

Pricing
    and Marketing in Canada

Any oil or gas export to be made pursuant to an export contract
    of a certain duration or covering a certain quantity requires an
    exporter to obtain an export permit from Canada’s National
    Energy Board (“NEB”). The governments of Alberta,
    British Columbia and Saskatchewan also regulate the volume of
    natural gas that may be removed from those provinces for
    consumption elsewhere.

Investment
    Canada Act

The Investment Canada Act requires federal government of Canada
    approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a
    Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by
    Canadians. In certain circumstances, the acquisition of natural
    resource properties may be considered to be a transaction
    requiring such approval.

Production
    Sharing Contracts

Some of our international licenses are governed by production
    sharing contracts (“PSCs”) between the concessionaires
    and the granting government agency. PSCs are contracts that
    define and regulate the framework for investments, revenue
    sharing, and taxation of mineral interests in foreign countries.
    Unlike most domestic leases, PSCs have defined production terms
    and time limits of generally 30 years. PSCs also generally
    contain sliding scale revenue sharing provisions. As a result,
    at either higher production rates or higher cumulative rates of
    return, PSCs generally allow the government agency to retain
    higher fractions of revenue.

Environmental
    and Occupational Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal,
    local and international laws and regulations concerning
    occupational safety and health as well as the discharge of
    materials into, and the protection of, the environment.
    Environmental laws and regulations relate to, among other
    things, assessing the environmental impact of seismic
    acquisition, drilling or construction activities; the
    generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste
    materials; the emission of certain gases into the atmosphere;
    the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well
    and other sites, including sites of former operations; and the
    development of emergency response and spill contingency plans.
    The application of worldwide standards, such as ISO 14000
    governing Environmental Management Systems, is required to be
    implemented for some international oil and gas operations.

In 1997, numerous countries participated in an international
    conference under the United Nations Framework Convention on
    Climate Change and adopted an agreement known as the Kyoto
    Protocol (the “Protocol”). The Protocol became
    effective February 16, 2005, and requires reductions of
    certain emissions that contribute to atmospheric levels of
    greenhouse gases (“GHG”). Certain countries in which
    we operate (but



not the United States) have ratified the Protocol. Pursuant to
    its ratification of the Protocol in April 2007, the federal
    government of Canada released its Regulatory Framework for Air
    Emissions, a plan to implement mandatory reductions in GHG
    emissions by way of regulation under existing legislation. The
    mandatory reductions on GHG emissions will create additional
    costs for the Canadian oil and gas industry. Certain provinces
    in Canada have also implemented legislation and regulations to
    reduce GHG emissions, which will also have a cost associated
    with compliance. Presently, it is not possible to accurately
    estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any laws or
    regulations developed to achieve emissions reductions in Canada
    or elsewhere, but such expenditures could be substantial.

In 2006, we published our Corporate Climate Change Position and
    Strategy. Key components of the strategy include initiation of
    energy efficiency measures, tracking emerging climate change
    legislation and publication of a corporate GHG emission
    inventory, which occurred in January 2008. Devon continues to
    explore energy efficiency measures and greenhouse gas emission
    reduction opportunities. We also continue to monitor legislative
    and regulatory climate change developments. All provisions of
    the strategy are completed or are in progress.

We consider the costs of environmental protection and safety and
    health compliance necessary and manageable parts of our
    business. With the efforts of our Environmental, Health and
    Safety Department, we have been able to plan for and comply with
    environmental, safety and health initiatives without materially
    altering our operating strategy. We anticipate making increased
    expenditures of both a capital and expense nature as a result of
    the increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of
    the environment and safety and health compliance. While our
    unreimbursed expenditures in 2008 attributable to such matters
    were immaterial, we cannot predict with any reasonable degree of
    certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.

We maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to
    limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial
    environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and
    accidental discharges of oil, salt water or other substances.
    However, we do not maintain 100% coverage concerning any
    environmental claim, and no coverage is maintained with respect
    to any penalty or fine required to be paid because of a
    violation of law.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    5,500 employees. We consider labor relations with our
    employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages
    or strikes pertaining to our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business activities, and the oil and gas industry in
    general, are subject to a variety of risks. If any of the
    following risk factors should occur, our profitability,
    financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted.
    As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of
    their investment in Devon.

Oil, Gas
    and NGL Prices are Volatile

Our financial results are highly dependent on the prices of and
    demand for oil, gas and NGLs. A significant downward movement of
    the prices for these commodities could have a material adverse
    effect on our revenues, operating cash flows and profitability.
    Such a downward price movement could also have a material
    adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves, the carrying
    value of our oil and gas properties, the level of planned
    drilling activities and future growth. Historically, prices have
    been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the
    future due to numerous factors beyond our control. These factors
    include, but are not limited to:

•

consumer demand for oil, gas and NGLs;

•

conservation efforts;

•

OPEC production levels;

•

weather;

•

regional pricing differentials;

•

differing quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus
    heavy or sour crude) and Btu content of gas produced;

•

the level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels;

•

the overall economic environment; and

•

governmental regulations and taxes.

Estimates
    of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves are Uncertain

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available
    geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir,
    particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of
    judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop
    different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue
    based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a
    given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result
    of several factors including additional development activity,
    the viability of production under varying economic conditions
    and variations in production levels and associated costs.
    Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates
    may occur as a result of changes in any of these factors. Such
    revisions to proved reserves could have a material adverse
    effect on our estimates of future net revenue, as well as our
    financial condition and profitability. Additional discussion of
    our policies regarding estimating and recording reserves is
    described in “Item 2. Properties — Proved
    Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue.”

Discoveries
    or Acquisitions of Additional Reserves are Needed to Avoid a
    Material Decline in Reserves and Production

The production rates from oil and gas properties generally
    decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit
    production costs generally increase, due to decreasing reservoir
    pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved
    reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline
    materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful
    exploration and development activities or, through engineering
    studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells,
    secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves, or
    acquire additional properties containing proved reserves.
    Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL



production and related per unit production costs are highly
    dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring
    additional reserves.

Future
    Exploration and Drilling Results are Uncertain and Involve
    Substantial Costs

Substantial costs are often required to locate and acquire
    properties and drill exploratory wells. Such activities are
    subject to numerous risks, including the risk that we will not
    encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The
    costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain. In
    addition, oil and gas properties can become damaged or drilling
    operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of
    a variety of factors including, but not limited to:

•

unexpected drilling conditions;

•

pressure or irregularities in reservoir formations;

•

equipment failures or accidents;

•

fires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;

•

marine risks such as capsizing, collisions and hurricanes;

•

other adverse weather conditions;

•

lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods;

•

environmental hazards or liabilities; and

•

shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery
    of equipment.

A significant occurrence of one of these factors could result in
    a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular
    property. In addition, drilling activities may not be successful
    in establishing proved reserves. Such a failure could have an
    adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
    condition. While both exploratory and developmental drilling
    activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves
    greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial
    quantities of hydrocarbons. We are currently performing
    exploratory drilling activities in certain international
    countries. We have been granted drilling concessions in these
    countries that require commitments on our behalf to incur
    capital expenditures. Even if future drilling activities are
    unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves, we will likely be
    required to fulfill our commitments to make such capital
    expenditures.

Industry
    Competition For Leases, Materials, People and Capital Can Be
    Significant

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
    industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent
    oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases
    and properties. We also compete for the equipment and personnel
    required to explore, develop and operate properties. Competition
    is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs.
    Typically, during times of high or rising commodity prices,
    drilling and operating costs will also increase. Higher prices
    will also generally increase the costs of properties available
    for acquisition. Certain of our competitors have financial and
    other resources substantially larger than ours, and they have
    also established strategic long-term positions and maintain
    strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may
    seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive
    disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many
    of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when
    responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas
    production, such as changing worldwide price and production
    levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the
    application of government regulations.



International
    Operations Have Uncertain Political, Economic and Other
    Risks

Our operations outside North America are based primarily in
    Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. We face political and economic
    risks and other uncertainties in these areas that are more
    prevalent than what exist for our operations in North America.
    Such factors include, but are not limited to:

•

general strikes and civil unrest;

•

the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation, forced
    renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

•

import and export regulations;

•

taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and
    retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

•

transportation regulations and tariffs;

•

exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other
    activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments
    or the movement of funds;

•

laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade,
    including trade sanctions;

•

the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of
    foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to
    licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we
    currently operate;

•

the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the
    jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and

•

difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency
    because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign
    sovereignty over international operations.

Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and
    gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims
    superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to
    us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or
    be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our
    overall business and results of operations by distracting
    management’s attention from our more significant assets.
    Various regions of the world have a history of political and
    economic instability. This instability could result in new
    governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in
    a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment.
    In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of
    contract rights and expropriation of foreign-owned assets. This
    could adversely affect our interests and our future
    profitability.

The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities
    may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our
    operations in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty
    surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign
    may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including
    disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and
    the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including
    pipelines, production facilities, processing plants and
    refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties
    of, an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur
    significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against
    terrorist activities.

Government
    Laws and Regulations Can Change

Our operations are subject to federal laws and regulations in
    the United States, Canada and the other countries in which we
    operate. In addition, we are also subject to the laws and
    regulations of various states, provinces, tribal and local
    governments. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous government
    departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and
    regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its
    individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties
    for failure to comply. Changes in such legislation have
    affected, and at times in the future could affect, our
    operations. Political developments can restrict production
    levels, enact price controls, change environmental protection
    requirements, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts
    payable to governments or governmental agencies. Although we are
    unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such
    changes could significantly impact our profitability. While such



legislation can change at any time in the future, those laws and
    regulations outside North America to which we are subject
    generally include greater risk of unforeseen change.

Environmental
    Matters and Costs Can Be Significant

As an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to various federal, state, provincial, tribal, local
    and international laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us
    for the cost of pollution

clean-up

resulting from our operations in affected areas. Any future
    environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the
    environment are uncertain and will be governed by several
    factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.
    There is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or
    regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not
    have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.

Insurance
    Does Not Cover All Risks

Exploration, development, production and processing of oil, gas
    and NGLs can be hazardous and involve unforeseen occurrences
    such as hurricanes, blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well
    control. These occurrences can result in damage to or
    destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to
    persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment.
    We maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities in
    accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that
    management believes to be prudent. However, insurance against
    all operational risks is not available to us. Due to changes in
    the insurance marketplace following hurricanes in the Gulf of
    Mexico in recent years, we currently do not have coverage for
    any damage that may be caused by future named windstorms in the
    Gulf of Mexico.

Certain
    of Our Investments Are Subject To Risks That May Affect Their
    Liquidity and Value

To maximize earnings on available cash balances, we periodically
    invest in securities that we consider to be short-term in nature
    and generally available for short-term liquidity needs. During
    2007, we purchased asset-backed securities that have an auction
    rate reset feature (“auction rate securities”). Our
    auction rate securities generally have contractual maturities of
    more than 20 years. However, the underlying interest rates
    on our securities are scheduled to reset every seven to
    28 days. Therefore, when we bought these securities, they
    were generally priced and subsequently traded as short-term
    investments because of the interest rate reset feature. At
    December 31, 2008, our auction rate securities totaled
    $122 million.

Since February 8, 2008, we have experienced difficulty
    selling our securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism, which provided liquidity to these securities. An
    auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
    securities could not do so. The securities for which auctions
    have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned
    every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature. Due to
    continued auction failures throughout 2008, we consider these
    investments to be long-term in nature and generally not
    available for short-term liquidity needs.

Our auction rate securities are rated AAA — the
    highest rating — by one or more rating agencies and
    are collateralized by student loans that are substantially
    guaranteed by the United States government. These investments
    are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest
    rate risks, which may be exacerbated by continued problems in
    the global credit markets, including but not limited to,
    U.S. subprime mortgage defaults, writedowns by major
    financial institutions due to deteriorating values of their
    asset portfolios (including leveraged loans, collateralized debt
    obligations, credit default swaps, and other credit-linked
    products). These and other related factors have affected various
    sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity
    issues. If issuers are unable to successfully close future
    auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, our ability to
    liquidate these securities and fully recover the carrying value
    of our investment in the near term may be limited. Under such
    circumstances, we may record an impairment charge on these
    investments in the future.

Item 2.

Properties

Substantially all of our properties consist of interests in
    developed and undeveloped oil and gas leases and mineral acreage
    located in our core operating areas. These interests entitle us
    to drill for and produce oil, gas and NGLs from specific areas.
    Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and,
    to a lesser extent, overriding royalty, mineral and net profits
    interests, foreign government concessions and other forms of
    direct and indirect ownership in oil and gas properties.

We also have certain midstream assets, including natural gas and
    NGL processing plants and pipeline systems. Our most significant
    midstream assets are our assets serving the Barnett Shale region
    in north Texas. These assets include approximately
    3,100 miles of pipeline, two natural gas processing plants
    with 750 MMcf per day of total capacity, and a
    15 MBbls per day NGL fractionator. To support our continued
    development and growing production in the Woodford Shale,
    located in southeastern Oklahoma, we constructed the Northridge
    natural gas processing plant in 2008. The Northridge plant has a
    capacity of 200 MMcf per day.

Our midstream assets also include the Access Pipeline
    transportation system in Canada. This

220-mile

dual pipeline system extends from our Jackfish operations in
    northern Alberta to a 350 MBbls storage terminal in
    Edmonton. The dual pipeline system allows us to blend the
    Jackfish heavy oil production with condensate and transport the
    combined product to the Edmonton crude oil market for sale. We
    have a 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline.

Proved
    Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue

The SEC defines proved oil and gas reserves as the estimated
    quantities of crude oil, gas and NGLs that geological and
    engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
    recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
    economic and operating conditions. Existing economic and
    operating conditions is defined as those prices and costs as of
    the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of
    changes in existing prices provided only by contractual
    arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
    conditions.

The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex
    and requires significant judgment as discussed in
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” As a result, we have
    developed internal policies for estimating and recording
    reserves. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved
    reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and
    guidance. Our policies assign responsibilities for compliance in
    reserves bookings to our Reserve Evaluation Group (the
    “Group”) and require that reserve estimates be made by
    qualified reserves estimators (“QREs”), as defined by
    the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standards. A list of
    our QREs is kept by the Senior Advisor — Corporate
    Reserves. All QREs are required to receive education covering
    the fundamentals of SEC proved reserves assignments.

The Group is responsible for the internal review and
    certification of reserve estimates and includes the
    Director — Reserves and Economics and the Senior
    Advisor — Corporate Reserves. The Group reports
    independently of any of our operating divisions. The Senior Vice
    President — Strategic Development is directly
    responsible for overseeing the Group and reports to our
    President. No portion of the Group’s compensation is
    directly dependent on the quantity of reserves booked.

Throughout the year, the Group performs internal audits of each
    operating division’s reserves. Selection criteria of
    reserves that are audited include major fields and major
    additions and revisions to reserves. In addition, the Group
    reviews reserve estimates with each of the third-party petroleum
    consultants discussed below.

In addition to internal audits, we engage three independent
    petroleum consulting firms to both prepare and audit a
    significant portion of our proved reserves. Ryder Scott Company,
    L.P. prepared the 2008 reserve estimates for all of our offshore
    Gulf of Mexico properties and for 99% of our International
    proved reserves. LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. audited the
    2008 reserve estimates for 90% of our domestic onshore
    properties. AJM Petroleum Consultants audited 78% of our
    Canadian reserves.



Set forth below is a summary of the reserves that were
    evaluated, either by preparation or audit, by independent
    petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2008, 2007 and
    2006.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by our employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

In addition to conducting these internal and external reviews,
    we also have a Reserves Committee which consists of three
    independent members of our Board of Directors. Although we are
    not required to have a Reserves Committee, we established ours
    in 2004 to provide additional oversight of our reserves
    estimation and certification process. The Reserves Committee was
    designed to assist the Board of Directors with its duties and
    responsibilities in evaluating and reporting our proved
    reserves, much like our Audit Committee assists the Board of
    Directors in supervising our audit and financial reporting
    requirements. Besides being independent, the members of our
    Reserves Committee also have educational backgrounds in geology
    or petroleum engineering, as well as experience relevant to the
    reserves estimation process.

The Reserves Committee meets at least twice a year to discuss
    reserves issues and policies, and periodically meets separately
    with our senior reserves engineering personnel and our
    independent petroleum consultants. The responsibilities of the
    Reserves Committee include the following:

•

perform an annual review and evaluation of our consolidated oil,
    gas and NGL reserves;

•

verify the integrity of our reserves evaluation and reporting
    system;

•

evaluate, prepare and disclose our compliance with legal and
    regulatory requirements related to our oil, gas and NGL reserves;

•

investigate and verify the qualifications and independence of
    our independent engineering consultants;

•

monitor the performance of our independent engineering
    consultants; and

•

monitor and evaluate our business practices and ethical
    standards in relation to the preparation and disclosure of
    reserves.



The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves and
    related estimated cash flow information as of December 31,
    2008. These estimates correspond with the method used in
    presenting the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas
    Operations” in Note 20 to our consolidated financial
    statements included herein.

No estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or
    included in reports to any federal or foreign governmental
    authority or agency since the beginning of 2008 except in
    filings with the SEC and the Department of Energy
    (“DOE”). Reserve estimates filed with the SEC
    correspond with the estimates of our reserves contained herein.
    Reserve estimates filed with the DOE are based upon the same
    underlying technical and economic assumptions as the estimates
    of our reserves included herein. However, the DOE requires
    reports to include the interests of all owners in wells that we
    operate and to exclude all interests in wells that we do not
    operate.

The prices used in calculating the estimated future net revenues
    attributable to proved reserves do not necessarily reflect
    market prices for oil, gas and NGL production subsequent to
    December 31, 2008. There can be no assurance that all of
    the proved reserves will be produced and sold within the periods
    indicated, that the assumed prices will be realized or that
    existing contracts will be honored or judicially enforced.

    Revenue and Price History

Certain information concerning oil, gas and NGL production,
    prices, revenues (net of all royalties, overriding royalties and
    other third-party interests) and operating expenses for the
    three years ended December 31, 2008, is set forth in
    “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Operation
    of Properties

The day-to-day operations of oil and gas properties are the
    responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or
    operating agreements. The operator supervises production,
    maintains production records, employs field personnel and
    performs other functions.

We are the operator of 22,527 of our wells. As operator, we
    receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the
    performance of our duties as well as monthly per-well producing
    and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged
    in the area. In presenting our financial data, we record the
    monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and
    administrative expense, which is a common industry practice.

Organization
    Structure and Property Profiles

Our properties are located within the U.S. onshore and
    offshore regions, Canada, and certain locations outside North
    America. The following table presents proved reserve information
    for our significant properties as of December 31, 2008,
    along with their production volumes for the year 2008.
    Additional summary profile information for our significant
    properties is provided following the table.

We have certain North American onshore and offshore properties
    we consider to be significant because they may be the source of
    significant future growth in proved reserves and production.
    However, these



properties are not included in the following table because as of
    December 31, 2008, such properties had only minimal, if
    any, proved reserves or production. Onshore, these properties
    include the Haynesville, Cana and Cody properties in the
    U.S. and the Horn River Basin properties in Canada.
    Offshore, these properties include our deepwater development and
    exploration properties in the Gulf of Mexico. These properties
    and our related development plans are discussed along with our
    other significant properties following the table.

Also, as presented in the table, we had no proved reserves
    associated with our Jackfish operations as of December 31,
    2008. During 2008 and thus far in 2009, we have been producing
    heavy oil from our Jackfish property. However, due to low crude
    oil prices and unfavorable operating conditions as of
    December 31, 2008, our Jackfish reserves did not meet the
    existing economic and operating condition requirement to be
    classified as proved at the end of 2008.

U.S.
    Onshore

Barnett Shale

— The Barnett Shale, located in
    north Texas, is our largest property both in terms of production
    and proved reserves. Our leases include approximately
    715,000 net acres located primarily in Denton, Johnson,
    Parker, Tarrant and Wise counties. The Barnett Shale is a
    non-conventional reservoir and it produces natural gas and NGLs.
    We have an average working interest of greater than 90%. We
    drilled 659 gross wells in 2008.

Carthage

— The Carthage area in east Texas
    includes primarily Harrison, Marion, Panola and Shelby counties.
    Our average working interest is about 85% and we hold
    approximately 173,000 net acres. Our Carthage area wells
    produce primarily natural gas and NGLs from conventional
    reservoirs. We drilled 132 gross wells in 2008.

Permian Basin, Texas

— Our oil and gas
    properties in the Permian Basin of west Texas comprise
    approximately 470,000 net acres located primarily in
    Andrews, Crane, Ector, Martin, Terry, Ward and Yoakum counties.
    These properties produce both oil and gas from conventional
    reservoirs. Our average working interest in these properties is
    about 40%. We drilled 71 gross wells in 2008.

Washakie

— Our Washakie area leases are
    concentrated in Carbon and Sweetwater counties in southern
    Wyoming. Our average working interest is about 76% and we hold
    about 157,000 net acres in the area. The Washakie wells
    produce primarily natural gas from conventional reservoirs. In
    2008, we drilled 115 gross wells.

Groesbeck

— The Groesbeck area of east Texas
    includes portions of Freestone, Leon, Limestone and Robertson
    counties. Our average working interest is approximately 72% and
    we hold about 168,000 net acres of land. The Groesbeck
    wells produce primarily natural gas from conventional
    reservoirs. In 2008, we drilled 16 gross wells.

Woodford Shale

— Our Woodford Shale properties
    in southeastern Oklahoma produce natural gas and NGLs from a
    non-conventional reservoir. Our 54,000 net acres are
    concentrated in Coal and Hughes counties and have an average
    working interest of about 57%. In 2008, we drilled
    131 gross wells in this area. To support our production in
    the Woodford Shale, we also brought online a 200 MMcf per
    day natural gas processing plant in 2008.

2009 Development Plans

— We expect 2009 oil,
    gas and NGL prices will be noticeably lower than those for 2008.
    As a result, we expect our operating cash flow will also be
    lower than that for 2008 and will require us to scale back our
    anticipated capital expenditures in 2009 compared to 2008.
    Accordingly, we expect to drill fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008
    for the key U.S. Onshore areas discussed above.

Our reduction in 2009 drilling activities in these areas is also
    related to our plan to devote a portion of our planned 2009
    capital expenditures to develop three new unconventional natural
    gas plays. In 2008, we built a position of nearly
    1.3 million net acres in these unconventional natural gas
    plays. In east Texas and north Louisiana we have accumulated
    approximately 570,000 net acres prospective for the
    Haynesville shale formation. In western Oklahoma, our Cana
    leasehold position targets the deep Woodford shale formation in
    the Anadarko Basin. We hold about 112,000 net acres in the
    Cana area. In south central Montana, we have accumulated a
    significant leasehold position for our Cody project area. We
    hold approximately 575,000 net acres in this region. In
    2009, we will continue to evaluate our acreage and drill wells
    in these emerging plays to assess the reserve and production
    potential of our acreage position.



U.S.
    Offshore

Deepwater Producing

— Our assets in the Gulf of
    Mexico include three significant producing
    properties — Magnolia, Merganser and
    Nansen — located in deep water (greater than
    600 feet). We have a 50% working interest in Merganser and
    Nansen and a 25% working interest in Magnolia. The three fields
    are located on federal leases and total approximately
    23,000 net acres. The properties produce both oil and gas.

Deepwater Development

— In addition to our
    three significant deepwater producing properties, we will
    continue development activities on our deepwater Cascade project
    throughout 2009. Cascade was discovered in 2002 and is located
    on federal leases encompassing approximately 12,000 net
    acres. We have a 50% working interest in Cascade. Production
    from Cascade, which will be primarily oil, is expected to begin
    in 2010. Cascade will be the first project in the Gulf to
    utilize an FPSO.

Deepwater Exploration

— Our exploration program
    in the Gulf of Mexico is focused primarily on deepwater
    opportunities. Our deepwater exploratory prospects include
    Miocene-aged objectives (five million to 24 million years)
    and older and deeper Lower Tertiary objectives. We hold federal
    leases comprising approximately one million net acres in our
    deepwater exploration inventory.

In 2006, a successful production test of the Jack
    No. 2 well provided evidence that our Lower Tertiary
    properties may be a source of meaningful future reserve and
    production growth. Through 2008, we have drilled four discovery
    wells in the Lower Tertiary. These include Cascade in 2002 (see
    “Deepwater Development” above), St. Malo in 2003, Jack
    in 2004 and Kaskida in 2006. We currently hold 161 blocks in the
    Lower Tertiary and we have identified 21 additional prospects to
    date.

At St. Malo, in which our working interest is 25%, we drilled
    two delineation wells in 2008. At Jack, where our working
    interest is 25%, we drilled a second appraisal well in 2008. A
    sidetrack appraisal well was drilled on the Kaskida unit in 2008
    and we commenced an additional delineation well in late 2008.
    Our working interest in Kaskida is 30%, and we believe Kaskida
    is the largest of our four Lower Tertiary discoveries to date.

Also in 2008, we participated in a sidetrack delineation well on
    the Miocene-aged Mission Deep discovery in which we have a 50%
    working interest. We have identified 14 additional prospects in
    our deepwater Miocene inventory to date.

In total, we drilled seven exploratory and appraisal wells in
    the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2008. Our working interests in
    these exploratory opportunities range from 25% to 50%. In 2009,
    we will continue to perform additional delineation drilling and
    continue to plan the development of Jack and St. Malo.

Canada

Lloydminster

— Our Lloydminster properties are
    located to the south and east of Jackfish in eastern Alberta and
    western Saskatchewan. Lloydminster produces heavy oil by
    conventional means without steam injection. We hold
    2.5 million net acres and have an 89% average working
    interest in our Lloydminster properties. In 2008, we drilled
    425 gross wells in the area.

Peace River Arch

— The Peace River Arch is
    located in west central Alberta. We hold approximately
    569,000 net acres in the area, which produces primarily
    natural gas and NGLs from conventional reservoirs. Our average
    working interest in the area is approximately 70%. We drilled
    66 gross wells in the Peace River Arch in 2008.

Deep Basin

— Our properties in Canada’s
    Deep Basin include portions of west central Alberta and east
    central British Columbia. We hold approximately 602,000 net
    acres in the Deep Basin. The area produces primarily natural gas
    and natural gas liquids from conventional reservoirs. Our
    average working interest in the Deep Basin is 45%. In 2008, we
    drilled 61 gross wells.

Northeast British Columbia

— Our northeast
    British Columbia properties are located primarily in British
    Columbia and to a lesser extent in northwestern Alberta. We hold
    approximately 1.7 million net acres in the



area. These properties produce principally natural gas from
    conventional reservoirs. We hold a 76% average working interest
    in these properties. We drilled 37 gross wells in the area
    in 2008.

Jackfish

— By the end of 2008, we ramped up
    production from our 100%-owned Jackfish thermal heavy oil
    project in the non-conventional oil sands of east central
    Alberta to 22,000 Bbls per day. We are employing
    steam-assisted gravity drainage at Jackfish. Production is
    expected to increase in 2009 to its peak production target of
    35,000 Bbls per day. We hold approximately 75,000 net
    acres in the entire Jackfish area, which can support expansion
    of the original project. In 2008, we received regulatory
    approval to develop a second phase of Jackfish. Like the first
    phase, this second phase of Jackfish is also expected to
    eventually produce 35,000 Bbls per day of heavy oil
    production.

2009 Development Plans

— Similar to our 2009
    plans for our U.S. Onshore areas discussed above, we expect
    to drill fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008 for the key areas in
    Canada discussed above. Our plans to drill fewer wells in these
    areas is also affected by our intentions to devote a portion of
    our planned 2009 capital expenditures to develop our positions
    in the Horn River Basin in northeast British Columbia. In 2008,
    we accumulated approximately 153,000 net acres targeting
    the Devonian shale in this area. In 2009, we will continue to
    evaluate our acreage and drill wells in this area to assess the
    reserve and production potential of our acreage position.

International

Azerbaijan

— Outside North America,
    Devon’s largest international property in terms of proved
    reserves is the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (“ACG”) oil
    field located offshore Azerbaijan in the Caspian Sea. ACG
    produces crude oil from conventional reservoirs. We hold
    approximately 6,000 net acres in the ACG field and have a
    5.6% working interest. In 2008, we participated in drilling
    15 gross wells.

China

— Our production in China is from the
    Panyu development in the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South
    China Sea. The Panyu fields produce oil from conventional
    reservoirs. In addition to Panyu, which is located on
    Block 15/34, we hold leases in four exploratory blocks
    offshore China. In total, we have 7.9 million net acres
    under lease in China. We have a 24.5% working interest at Panyu
    and 100% working interests in the exploratory blocks. We drilled
    seven gross wells in China in 2008.

Brazil

— In 2008, we continued to ramp up
    production from our Polvo development, which we operate with a
    60% working interest. Polvo is located offshore in the Campos
    Basin in Block BM-C-8. We experienced mechanical issues during
    2008 at Polvo that delayed bringing a portion of our expected
    production online. As of December 31, 2008, the mechanical
    issues appear to have been corrected, and we exited the year
    with gross production at approximately 17,000 Bbls per day.
    In addition to our development project at Polvo, we hold acreage
    in eight exploratory blocks. In aggregate, we have
    1.4 million net acres in Brazil. Our working interests
    range from 18% to 100% in these blocks. We drilled 12 gross
    wells in Brazil in 2008 and over the next two years we plan to
    drill up to eight exploratory wells.

Title to
    Properties

Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements
    customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for current taxes
    not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We
    believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the
    value of such properties or from the respective interests
    therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation
    of the business.

As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review
    of local records, little investigation of record title is made
    at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties.
    Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of
    outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an
    acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of
    drilling operations on undeveloped properties.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including
    Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of
    the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the
    producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from
    federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The principal suit
    in which Devon is a defendant is

United States ex rel.
    Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al.

(the “Wright
    case”). The suit was originally filed in August 1996 in the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
    but was consolidated in October 2000 with other suits for
    pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for
    the District of Wyoming. On July 10, 2003, the District of
    Wyoming remanded the Wright case back to the Eastern District of
    Texas to resume proceedings. On April 12, 2007, the court
    entered a trial plan and scheduling order in which the case will
    proceed in phases. Two phases have been scheduled to date. The
    first phase was scheduled to begin in August 2008, but the
    defendant settled prior to trial. The second phase was scheduled
    to begin in February 2009, but the defendants settled prior to
    trial. Devon was not included in the groups of defendants
    selected for these first two phases. Devon believes that it has
    acted reasonably, has legitimate and strong defenses to all
    allegations in the suit, and has paid royalties in good faith.
    Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material
    exposure with respect to this lawsuit and, therefore, no
    liability related to this lawsuit has been recorded.

Other
    Matters

We are involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the
    date of this report, there were no other material pending legal
    proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our
    property is subject.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase up
    to 50 million shares, which expires on December 31,
    2009. As of December 31, 2008, up to 45.5 million
    shares can be repurchased under the 50 million share
    repurchase program.

Our Board of Directors has also approved an ongoing, annual
    stock repurchase program to minimize dilution resulting from
    restricted stock issued to, and options exercised by, employees.
    In 2008, the repurchase program authorized the repurchase of up
    to 4.8 million shares or a cost of $422 million,
    whichever amount was reached first. When the 2008 portion of
    this annual program expired on December 31, 2008,
    2.0 million shares had been repurchased under this program
    for $178 million, or $87.83 per share.

No shares were repurchased under these programs during the
    fourth quarter of 2008.

Prior to the end of 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the
    2009 portion of the annual program. Under this program in 2009,
    we are authorized to repurchase up to 4.8 million shares or
    a cost of $360 million, whichever amount is reached first.

As of December 31, 2008, we are authorized to repurchase up
    to 50.3 million shares under publicly announced programs.
    This amount is comprised of the 45.5 million remaining
    shares authorized to be repurchased under the 50 million
    share repurchase program and the 4.8 million shares
    authorized to be repurchased under the annual repurchase program
    in 2009. However, in response to the current economic
    environment and recent downturn in commodity prices, we have
    indefinitely suspended activity under both these programs. As a
    result, we do not anticipate repurchasing shares under these
    programs in the foreseeable future. Should economic conditions
    or commodity prices strengthen, we will consider resumption of
    share repurchases under our authorized programs.

Overview
    of Business

Devon is one of the world’s leading independent oil and gas
    exploration and production companies. Our operations are focused
    primarily in the United States and Canada. However, we also
    explore for and produce oil and gas in select international
    areas, including Azerbaijan, Brazil and China. We also own
    natural gas pipelines and treatment facilities in many of our
    producing areas, making us one of North America’s larger
    processors of natural gas liquids.

Our portfolio of oil and gas properties provides stable
    production and a platform for future growth. Over
    90 percent of our production from continuing operations is
    from North America. Our production mix in 2008 was approximately
    65% gas and 35% oil and NGLs such as propane, butane and ethane.
    We are currently producing 2.6 Bcf of gas each day, or
    about 3% of all the gas consumed in North America.

In managing our global operations, we have an operating strategy
    that is focused on creating and increasing value per share. Key
    elements of this strategy are building oil and gas reserves and
    production, exercising capital discipline and controlling
    operating costs. We also use our marketing and midstream
    operations to improve our overall performance. Finally, we must
    continually preserve our financial flexibility to achieve
    sustainable, long-term success.

•

Reserves and production growth

— Our financial
    condition and profitability are significantly affected by the
    amount of proved reserves we own. Oil and gas properties are our
    most significant assets, and the reserves that relate to such
    properties are key to our future success. To increase our proved
    reserves, we must replace quantities produced with additional
    reserves from successful exploration and development activities
    or property acquisitions. Additionally, our profitability and
    operating cash flows are largely dependent on the amount of oil,
    gas and NGLs we produce. Growing production from existing
    properties is difficult because the rate of production from oil
    and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted.
    As a result, we constantly drill for and develop reserves on
    properties that provide a balance of near-term and long-term
    production. In addition, we may acquire properties with proved
    reserves that we can develop and subsequently produce to help us
    meet our production goals.

•

Capital investment discipline

— Effectively
    deploying our resources into capital projects is key to
    maintaining and growing future production and oil and gas
    reserves. As a result, we have historically deployed virtually
    all our available cash flow into capital projects. Therefore,
    maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in capital
    projects is important to our profitability and financial
    condition. Our ability to control capital expenditures can be
    affected by changes in commodity prices. During times of high
    commodity prices, drilling and related costs often escalate due
    to the effects of supply versus demand economics. The inverse is
    also true.

Approximately two-thirds of our planned 2009 investment in
    capital projects is dedicated to a foundation of low-risk
    projects primarily in North America. The remainder of our
    capital has been identified for longer-term projects primarily
    in new unconventional natural gas plays in several United States
    onshore regions, as well as continued offshore activities in the
    Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and China. By deploying our capital in
    this manner, we are able to consistently deliver cost-efficient
    drill-bit growth and provide a strong source of cash flow while
    balancing short-term and long-term growth targets.

•

Operating cost controls

— To maintain our
    competitive position, we must control our lease operating costs
    and other production costs. As reservoirs are depleted and
    production rates decline, per unit production costs will
    generally increase and affect our profitability and operating
    cash flows. Similar to capital expenditures, our ability to
    control operating costs can be affected by significant changes
    in commodity prices. Our base North American production is
    focused in core areas of our operations where we can achieve
    economies of scale to help manage our operating costs.

•

Marketing & midstream performance improvement

— We enhance the value of our oil and gas
    operations with our marketing and midstream business. By
    efficiently gathering and processing oil, gas



and NGL production, our midstream operations contribute to our
    strategies to grow reserves and production and manage
    expenditures. Additionally, by effectively marketing our
    production, we maximize the prices received for our oil, gas and
    NGL production in relation to market prices. This is important
    because our profitability is highly dependent on market prices.
    These prices are determined primarily by market conditions.
    Market conditions for these products have been, and will
    continue to be, influenced by regional and worldwide economic
    activity, weather and other factors that are beyond our control.
    To manage this volatility, we sometimes utilize financial
    hedging arrangements and fixed-price physical delivery
    contracts. As of February 16, 2009, approximately 10% of
    our 2009 gas production is associated with financial price
    collars or fixed-price contracts.

•

Financial flexibility preservation

— As
    mentioned, commodity prices have been and will continue to be
    volatile and will continue to impact our profitability and cash
    flow. We understand this fact and manage our debt levels
    accordingly to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility.
    We generally operate within the cash flow generated by our
    operations. However, during periods of low commodity prices, we
    may use our balance sheet strength to access debt or equity
    markets, allowing us to preserve our business and maintain
    momentum until markets recover. When prices improve, we can
    utilize excess operating cash flow to repay debt and invest in
    our activities that not only maintain but also increase value
    per share.

Overview
    of 2008 Results

2008 was a year of contrasts. By many measures, 2008 was
    the best year in our history. Throughout the year, we achieved
    key operational successes as we continued to execute on our
    operating strategy. We drilled a record amount of wells with a
    98% success rate and delivered a record amount of operating cash
    flow. As a result of our operational success and rising
    commodity prices, in the third quarter of 2008, we reported the
    largest quarterly earnings in our history.

However, sharp declines in oil, gas and NGL prices during the
    fourth quarter caused us to record noncash impairments of our
    oil and gas properties totaling $7.1 billion, net of income
    taxes. Due to this impairment charge, our record earnings in the
    third quarter were immediately followed by a record quarterly
    loss in the fourth quarter.

We account for our oil and gas properties using the full cost
    accounting method. Full cost impairment calculations require the
    use of quarter-end prices. As a result, such calculations do not
    indicate the true fair value of the underlying reserves because
    of the volatile nature of commodity prices. In fact, the SEC
    recently recognized that impairment calculations based upon
    prices as of a single day of the year are not ideal and issued
    new rules that require the use of

12-month

average prices for impairment calculations. These new rules will
    be effective for our 2009 year-end reporting. Had these new
    rules been in place as of December 31, 2008, we would not
    have recognized the noncash impairments.

Key measures of our performance for 2008, as well as certain
    operational developments, are summarized below:

•

Production grew 6% over 2007, to 238 million Boe.

•

The combined realized price for oil, gas and NGLs per Boe
    increased 28% to $54.97.

•

Marketing and midstream operating profit climbed to a record
    $668 million.

•

Production and operating costs increased 19% per Boe due to our
    large-scale projects at Jackfish in Canada and Polvo in Brazil,
    which are experiencing higher

per-unit

costs while they are in the early phases of production.

•

Operating cash flow reached $9.4 billion, representing a
    41% increase over 2008.

•

Capitalized costs incurred in our oil and gas exploration and
    development activities were $9.8 billion in 2008.



Despite these positive results, we reported a net loss of
    $2.1 billion, or $4.85 per diluted share, for 2008. This
    represents a $5.8 billion decrease in earnings compared to
    2007, which was primarily attributable to the $7.1 billion,
    net of income tax, property impairments recognized in the fourth
    quarter of 2008.

From an operational perspective, we completed another successful
    year with the drill-bit. We drilled a record 2,441 gross
    wells with an overall 98% rate of success. This success rate
    enabled us to increase proved reserves by 584 million Boe,
    which represented nearly 2 and one half times our 2008
    production. Consistent with our two-pronged operating strategy,
    93% of the wells we drilled were North American development
    wells.

Besides completing another successful year of drilling, we also
    had several other key operational achievements during 2008. In
    the Gulf of Mexico, we continued to build off prior years’
    successful drilling results with our deepwater exploration and
    development program. At Cascade, we commenced drilling the first
    of two initial producing wells and continued work on production
    facilities and subsea equipment. We also continued progressing
    toward commercial development of our other previous discoveries
    in the Lower Tertiary trend of the Gulf of Mexico. We also added
    some 800,000 net undeveloped acres to our lease inventory,
    positioning us with more than 1.4 million net acres in four
    emerging unconventional natural gas plays in the United States.

In 2008, we substantially completed our African divestiture
    program. We have now sold all our oil and gas producing
    properties in Africa, generating aggregate proceeds of
    $2.2 billion after income taxes.

Additionally, on October 31, 2008, we transferred our
    14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock to Chevron. In
    exchange, we received Chevron’s interest in the
    Drunkard’s Wash coalbed natural gas field in east-central
    Utah and $280 million in cash. The field has approximately
    51,000 net acres and had net production of about
    40 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day at
    the time of the exchange.

Even with the fourth quarter net loss, we strengthened our
    financial position during 2008. We used cash on hand, operating
    cash flow, divestiture proceeds and Chevron exchange proceeds to
    fund $9.4 billion of capital expenditures, reduce debt by
    $2.1 billion, repurchase $815 million of common and
    preferred stock and pay $289 million of dividends. At the
    end of 2008, we had $379 million of cash, and as of
    January 31, 2009, we had $3.1 billion of availability
    under our credit lines.

Business
    and Industry Outlook

As previously mentioned, our current and future earnings depend
    largely on our ability to replace and grow oil and gas reserves,
    increase production and exert cost discipline. We must also
    manage commodity pricing risks to achieve long-term success.

Oil and gas prices reached historical high levels in recent
    years and during the first half of 2008. We have utilized the
    record operating cash flows generated by high commodity prices,
    along with proceeds from our African divestitures, to, among
    other uses, repay outstanding debt. During 2008 and 2007, we
    repaid outstanding debt totaling $3.9 billion. During this
    same period, we also repurchased $1.0 billion of our common
    stock and redeemed $150 million of preferred stock. High
    commodity prices have also been a key factor driving cost
    increases in the oil and gas industry that have exceeded general
    inflation trends. We are no different from others in the
    industry in that we have been impacted by these cost increases.

As we exited the third quarter of 2008, oil and gas prices had
    declined sharply from their recent record levels and declined
    even further through the end of 2008. In addition, recent
    problems in the credit markets, steep stock market declines,
    financial institution failures and government bail-outs provide
    evidence of a weakening United States and global economy. As a
    result of the market turmoil and price decreases, oil and gas
    companies with high debt levels and lack of liquidity have been,
    and will continue to be, negatively impacted. However, we do not
    consider ourselves to be in this category based on our current
    debt level and credit availability.

The only constant in the oil and gas business is volatility, and
    2008 presented us with some remarkable reminders. Our response
    to the current environment is to dramatically cut capital
    expenditures. We are



budgeting exploration and development capital at
    $3.5 billion to $4.1 billion for 2009. This is less
    than half of our 2008 investment in exploration and development.
    With the addition of non-oil and gas capital and other
    capitalized costs, we are forecasting total 2009 capital
    expenditures of $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion.

Assuming average benchmark prices of $45.00 per barrel of crude
    oil and $5.50 per Mcf of gas, our 2009 capital budget will
    require deficit spending of about $1 billion. Our
    philosophy has always been to live roughly within our cash flow,
    and we clearly will not continue to spend at this rate in future
    years without some improvement in oil and gas prices. However,
    in order to preserve our business and maintain a level of
    momentum that will allow us to take advantage of stronger prices
    when markets recover, we believe it is prudent to use our
    balance sheet strength to fund this additional $1 billion
    of spending in 2009. If we see further price weakness in 2009 or
    beyond, we are prepared to make further cuts.

We are dramatically decreasing our activity across most of our
    near-term development projects in North America. We will
    continue activity at a rate that will keep us competitive, but
    at a far lower level than in 2008. However, we are going to
    continue the momentum of some of our longer-term growth projects
    that will position us to bring on new production when oil and
    gas demand recovers. We are continuing to fund the second phase
    of our operations at Jackfish and the evaluation and development
    of our Lower Tertiary assets in the Gulf of Mexico. We will also
    move forward with the evaluation of our sizable acreage
    positions in several emerging natural gas plays in North America.

This decrease in development drilling will impact our oil and
    gas production. We are currently forecasting our 2009 production
    will be essentially flat with that of 2008.

We are fortunate that we are positioned to withstand the
    downturn in the global economy and the resulting weakness in oil
    and gas prices. The strength of our balance sheet and the
    quality of our oil and gas properties position us to emerge from
    the current environment and prosper in the future.

Oil
    Sales

2008 vs. 2007

Oil sales increased $1.2 billion as a
    result of a 35% increase in our realized price without hedges.
    The average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate index price increased
    38% during the same time period, accounting for the majority of
    the increase.

Oil sales decreased $104 million due to a two million
    barrel decrease in production. Our International production
    decreased approximately six million barrels due to reaching
    certain cost recovery thresholds of our carried interest in
    Azerbaijan. We also deferred 0.5 million barrels of oil
    production due to hurricanes. These



decreases were partially offset by additional production
    resulting from increased development activity at our Jackfish
    and Lloydminster areas in Canada and at our Polvo development in
    Brazil.

2007 vs. 2006

Oil sales increased $700 million due
    to a 13 million barrel increase in production. The increase
    in our 2007 oil production was primarily due to our properties
    in Azerbaijan where we achieved payout of certain carried
    interests in the last half of 2006. This led to a nine million
    barrel increase in 2007 as compared to 2006. Production also
    increased 3.5 million barrels due to increased development
    activity in our Lloydminster area in Canada. Also, oil sales
    from our Polvo field in Brazil began during the fourth quarter
    of 2007, which resulted in 0.5 million barrels of increased
    production.

Oil sales increased $359 million as a result of an 11%
    increase in our realized price without hedges. The average NYMEX
    West Texas Intermediate index price increased 9% during the same
    time period, accounting for the majority of the increase.

Gas
    Sales

2008 vs. 2007

Gas sales increased $1.7 billion as a
    result of a 29% increase in our realized price without hedges.
    This increase was largely due to increases in the regional index
    prices upon which our gas sales are based.

A 77 Bcf increase in production during 2008 caused gas
    sales to increase by $462 million. Our drilling and
    development program in the Barnett Shale field in north Texas
    contributed 83 Bcf to the gas production increase. This
    increase and the effect of new drilling and development in our
    other North American properties were partially offset by natural
    production declines and the deferral of seven Bcf of production
    in 2008 due to hurricanes.

2007 vs. 2006

A 55 Bcf increase in production caused
    gas sales to increase by $327 million. Our drilling and
    development program in the Barnett Shale field in north Texas
    contributed 53 Bcf to the gas production increase. The June
    2006 Chief Holdings LLC (“Chief”) acquisition also
    contributed 12 Bcf of increased production. During 2007, we
    also began first production from the Merganser field in the
    deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in seven Bcf of
    increased production. These increases and the effects of new
    drilling and development in our other North American properties
    were partially offset by natural production declines primarily
    in Canada.

A 1% decline in our average realized price without hedges caused
    gas sales to decrease $52 million in 2007.



Net

Our oil and gas derivative financial instruments include price
    swaps and costless price collars. For the price swaps, we
    receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable
    market price to the contract counterparty. The costless price
    collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production.
    If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the
    ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various
    collars, we cash-settle the difference with the counterparty.
    Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent
    realized losses or gains related to our price swaps and collars.



During 2008, we received $27 million, or $0.51 per Bbl,
    from counterparties to settle our oil price collars. We paid
    $424 million, or $0.45 per Mcf, to counterparties during
    2008 to settle our gas price swaps and collars. During 2007, we
    received $40 million, or $0.04 per Mcf, from counterparties
    to settle our gas price swaps and collars. In 2006, cash
    payments related to our gas price swaps and collars were
    completely offset by cash receipts.

In addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects, we
    also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil
    and gas derivative instruments in each reporting period. We
    estimate the fair values of our oil and gas derivative financial
    instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow
    calculations. From time to time, we validate our valuation
    techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value
    estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or
    brokers.

The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is
    our estimate of future commodity prices. We base our estimate of
    future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such
    as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments
    and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil
    instruments. Based on the amount of volumes subject to price
    swaps and collars at December 31, 2008, a 10% increase in
    these forward curves would have decreased our 2008 unrealized
    gain for our oil and gas collar derivative financial instruments
    by approximately $54 million. Another key input to our cash
    flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these
    forward curves, which we base primarily upon implied volatility.

Counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity
    derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any
    single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties.
    Our commodity derivative contracts are held with eight separate
    counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally
    require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the
    counterparty’s credit rating falls below “investment
    grade”. The threshold for collateral posting decreases as
    the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such
    thresholds generally range from zero to $50 million for the
    majority of our contracts. As of December 31, 2008, the
    credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade.

The $243 million net unrealized gain recognized in 2008 was
    primarily the result of a decrease in the Inside FERC Henry Hub
    forward curve subsequent to our contract trade dates.

    gas pipeline throughput.

2007 vs. 2006

Marketing and midstream revenues increased
    $64 million, while operating costs and expenses decreased
    $9 million, causing operating profit to increase

Lease
    Operating Expenses (“LOE”)

2008 vs. 2007

LOE increased $389 million in 2008.
    The largest contributor to this increase, as well as the
    increase in LOE per Boe, was higher

per-unit

costs associated with new thermal heavy oil production from our
    Jackfish operations in Canada as well as new oil production from
    Brazil. As these large-scale projects are in the early phases of
    production,

per-unit

operating costs are higher than the

per-unit

costs for our overall portfolio of producing properties. LOE
    also increased $112 million due to our 6% growth in
    production. Additionally, LOE increased $31 million due to
    damages to certain of our facilities and transportation systems
    caused by Hurricane Ike in the third quarter of 2008. These
    hurricane damages also contributed to the increase in LOE per
    Boe.

2007 vs. 2006

LOE increased $403 million in 2007.
    The largest contributor to this increase was our 12% growth in
    production, which caused an increase of $168 million.
    Another key contributor to the LOE increase was the effects of
    inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field
    services. Increased demand for these services continued to drive
    costs higher for materials, equipment and personnel used in both
    recurring activities as well as well-workover projects during
    2007. Furthermore, changes in the exchange rate between the
    U.S. and Canadian dollar also caused LOE to increase
    $40 million.

Production
    Taxes

The following table details the changes in production taxes
    between 2006 and 2008. The majority of our production taxes are
    assessed on our onshore domestic properties. In the U.S., most
    of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of
    revenues. Therefore, the changes due to revenues in the table
    primarily relate to changes in oil, gas and NGL revenues from
    our U.S. onshore properties.

2008 production taxes

$


2008 vs. 2007

Production taxes increased $59 million
    due to an increase in the effective production tax rate in 2008.
    Our higher production tax rates in 2008 were largely due to
    higher rates in China, which are



based on the level of crude oil prices. As our realized price
    for crude oil sales in China increases or decreases, production
    tax rates will increase or decrease in a like manner.

2007 vs. 2006

Production taxes decreased $66 million
    due to a decrease in the effective production tax rate in 2007.
    Our lower production tax rates in 2007 were primarily due to an
    increase in tax credits received on certain horizontal wells in
    the state of Texas and the increase in Azerbaijan revenues
    subsequent to the payouts of our carried interests in the last
    half of 2006. Our Azerbaijan revenues are not subject to
    production taxes. Therefore, the increased revenues generated in
    Azerbaijan in 2007 caused our overall rate of production taxes
    to decrease.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties
    (“DD&A”)

DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated by multiplying
    the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during
    the year, by the “depletable base.” The depletable
    base represents our net capitalized investment plus future
    development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves.
    Generally, if reserve volumes are revised up or down, then the
    DD&A rate per unit of production will change inversely.
    However, if the depletable base changes, then the DD&A rate
    moves in the same direction. The per unit DD&A rate is not
    affected by production volumes. Absolute or total DD&A, as
    opposed to the rate per unit of production, generally moves in
    the same direction as production volumes. Oil and gas property
    DD&A is calculated separately on a

country-by-country

basis.

The changes in our production volumes, DD&A rate per unit
    and DD&A of oil and gas properties between 2006 and 2008
    are shown in the table below.

2008 vs. 2007

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    increased $434 million due to a 15% increase in the
    DD&A rate. The largest contributor to the rate increase was
    inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2008 as
    well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future
    periods on proved undeveloped reserves. Other factors
    contributing to the rate increase include reductions in reserve
    estimates due to lower 2008 year-end commodity prices and
    the transfer of previously unproved costs to the depletable base
    as a result of 2008 drilling activities. In addition to the
    impact from the higher 2008 rate, our 6% production increase
    caused oil and gas property related DD&A expense to
    increase $164 million.



2007 vs. 2006

Oil and gas property related DD&A
    increased $355 million due to a 15% increase in the
    DD&A rate. The largest contributor to the rate increase was
    inflationary pressure on both the costs incurred during 2007 as
    well as the estimated development costs to be spent in future
    periods on proved undeveloped reserves. Other factors
    contributing to the rate increase include the transfer of
    previously unproved costs to the depletable base as a result of
    2007 drilling activities and a higher
    Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2007. The net
    effect of these increases was partially offset by higher reserve
    estimates due to higher 2007 year-end commodity prices. In
    addition to the impact from the higher 2007 rate, our 12%
    production increase caused oil and gas property related
    DD&A expense to increase $242 million.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our net G&A consists of three primary components. The
    largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses
    incurred for personnel costs, office expenses, professional fees
    and other G&A items. The gross amount of these expenses is
    partially offset by two components. One is the amount of
    G&A capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of
    accounting related to exploration and development activities.
    The other is the amount of G&A reimbursed by working
    interest owners of properties for which we serve as the
    operator. These reimbursements are received during both the
    drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. The
    gross amount of G&A incurred, less the amounts capitalized
    and reimbursed, is recorded as net G&A in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Net G&A includes
    expenses related to oil, gas and NGL exploration and production
    activities, as well as marketing and midstream activities. See
    the following table for a summary of G&A expenses by
    component.

All percentage changes included in this table are based on
    actual figures and not the rounded figures included in this
    table.

2008 vs. 2007

Gross G&A increased $241 million.
    The largest contributors to the increase were higher employee
    compensation and benefits costs. These cost increases, which
    were largely related to our growth and industry inflation during
    most of 2008, caused gross G&A to increase
    $184 million. Of this increase, $79 million related to
    higher stock compensation.

Stock compensation increased $27 million in the second
    quarter of 2008 due to a modification of the share-based
    compensation arrangements for certain of our executives. The
    modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who
    meet certain years-of-service and age criteria can retire and
    continue vesting in outstanding share-based grants. As a
    condition to receiving the benefits of these modifications, the
    executives must agree not to use or disclose Devon’s
    confidential information and not to solicit Devon’s
    employees and customers. The executives are required to agree to
    these conditions at retirement and again in each subsequent year
    until all grants have vested.

Although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of
    the executives’ grants, it does accelerate the expense
    recognition as executives approach the years-of-service and age
    criteria. When the modification was made in the second quarter
    of 2008, certain executives had already met the years-of-service
    and age criteria. As a result, we recognized $27 million of
    share-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2008
    related to this modification. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    recognized an additional $16 million of stock compensation
    for grants made to these executives. The additional expenses
    would have been recognized in future reporting periods if the
    modification had not been made and the executives continued
    their employment at Devon.



The higher employee compensation and benefits costs, exclusive
    of the accelerated stock compensation expense, were also the
    primary factors that caused the $94 million increase in
    capitalized G&A in 2008.

2007 vs. 2006

Gross G&A increased $198 million.
    The largest contributors to this increase were higher employee
    compensation and benefits costs. These cost increases, which
    were related to our growth and industry inflation during 2007,
    caused gross G&A to increase $134 million. Of
    this increase, $55 million related to higher stock
    compensation. In addition, changes in the
    Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate caused a
    $13 million increase in costs.

The factors discussed above were also the primary factors that
    caused the $69 million increase in capitalized G&A in
    2007.

Interest based on debt outstanding decreased $82 million
    from 2007 to 2008. This decrease was largely due to lower
    average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit
    facility borrowings in 2008 than in 2007. The decrease in
    borrowings resulted largely from the use of proceeds from our
    West African divestiture program and cash flow from operations
    to repay all commercial paper and credit facility borrowings in
    the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, we retired debentures
    with a face value of $652 million during 2008, primarily
    during the third quarter.

Interest based on debt outstanding increased $22 million
    from 2006 to 2007. This increase was largely due to higher
    average outstanding amounts for commercial paper and credit
    facility borrowings in 2007 than in 2006, partially offset by
    the effects of repaying various maturing notes in 2007 and 2006.

Capitalized interest increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due
    to higher cumulative costs related to large-scale development
    projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, partially offset by
    lower capitalized interest resulting from the completion of the
    Access Pipeline in Canada.

Capitalized interest increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due
    to higher cumulative costs related to large-scale development
    projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. Higher cumulative
    costs related to the development of the second phase of our
    Jackfish heavy oil development project in Canada and the
    construction of the related Access Pipeline also contributed to
    the increase.

Chevron
    Common Stock and Related Embedded Option

Prior to 2007, we recognized unrealized changes in the fair
    values of our investment in 14.2 million shares of Chevron
    common stock as part of other comprehensive income. Effective
    January 1, 2007 as a result of our adoption of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including
    an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

, we began
    recognizing unrealized gains and losses on our investment in
    Chevron common stock in net earnings rather than as part of
    other comprehensive income. On October 31, 2008, we
    exchanged these shares of Chevron common stock for
    Chevron’s interest in the Drunkard’s Wash properties
    located in east-central Utah and $280 million in cash. In
    accordance with the terms of the exchange, the fair value of our
    investment in the Chevron shares was estimated to be $67.71 per
    share on the exchange date. Prior to the exchange of these
    shares, we calculated the fair value of our investment in
    Chevron common stock using Chevron’s published market price.

We also recognized unrealized changes in the fair value of the
    conversion option embedded in the debentures exchangeable into
    shares of Chevron common stock. The embedded option was not
    actively traded in an established market. Therefore, we
    estimated its fair value using quotes obtained from a broker for
    trades occurring near the valuation date. Since the exchangeable
    debentures were retired in August 2008, we will not recognize
    any future gains or losses from the embedded option.

The loss during 2008 on our investment in Chevron common stock
    was directly attributable to a $25.62 per share decrease in the
    estimated fair value while we owned Chevron’s common stock
    during the year. The gain on the embedded option during 2008 was
    directly attributable to the change in fair value of the Chevron
    common stock from January 1, 2008 to the maturity date of
    August 15, 2008. The gain on our investment in Chevron
    common stock and loss on the embedded option during 2007 were
    directly attributable to a $19.80 increase in the price per
    share of Chevron’s common stock during 2007.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

We also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our
    interest rate swaps each reporting period. We estimate the fair
    values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily
    by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon
    forward interest-rate yields. From time to time, we validate our
    valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair
    value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties
    or brokers.

The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is
    our estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our
    estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that
    utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds
    Rate provided by a third party. Based on the notional amount
    subject to the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008, a
    10% increase in these forward curves would have decreased our
    2008 unrealized gain for our interest rate swaps by
    approximately $3 million.



During 2008, we recorded a $104 million unrealized gain as
    a result of changes in interest rates subsequent to the trade
    dates of our contracts.

As previously discussed for our commodity derivative contracts,
    counterparty credit risk is also a component of interest rate
    derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any
    single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties.
    Our interest rate derivative contracts are held with five
    separate counterparties and have cash collateral posting
    requirements. Additionally, the credit ratings of all our
    counterparties were investment grade as of December 31,
    2008.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2008 and 2006, we reduced the carrying values of certain
    of our oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities. A summary
    of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below.

    Reductions

The 2008 reductions were all recognized in the fourth quarter of
    2008 and resulted primarily from a significant decrease in each
    country’s full cost ceiling. The lower ceiling values
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil, gas
    and NGL prices compared to previous quarter-end prices. To
    demonstrate this decline, the December 31, 2008 and
    September 30, 2008 weighted average wellhead prices for the
    United States, Canada and Brazil are presented in the following
    table.

The December 31, 2008 oil and gas wellhead prices in the
    table above compare to the NYMEX cash price of $44.60 per Bbl
    for crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $5.71 per MMBtu
    for gas. The September 30, 2008, wellhead prices in the
    table compare to the NYMEX cash price of $100.64 per Bbl for
    crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $7.12 per MMBtu for
    gas.

    Reductions

As a result of a decline in the estimated future net revenues,
    the carrying value of our Russian oil and gas properties
    exceeded the full cost ceiling by $10 million at the end of
    the third quarter of 2006. Therefore, we



recognized a $20 million reduction of the carrying value of
    our oil and gas properties in Russia, offset by a
    $10 million deferred income tax benefit.

During the second quarter of 2006, we drilled two unsuccessful
    exploratory wells in Brazil and determined that the capitalized
    costs related to these two wells should be impaired. Therefore,
    in the second quarter of 2006, we recognized a $16 million
    impairment of our investment in Brazil equal to the costs to
    drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share of
    block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related to this
    impairment. The two wells were unrelated to our Polvo
    development project in Brazil.

Interest and dividend income decreased from 2007 to 2008
    primarily due to a decrease in interest rates, as well as a
    decrease in dividends received on our investment in Chevron
    common stock. Interest and dividend income decreased from 2006
    to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in income-earning cash and
    investment balances, partially offset by an increase in the
    dividend rate on our investment in Chevron common stock.

We suffered insured damages in the third quarter of 2005 related
    to hurricanes that struck the Gulf of Mexico. During 2006 and
    2007, we received $480 million as a full settlement of the
    amount due from our primary insurers and certain of our
    secondary insurers. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    received $106 million as full settlement of the amount due
    from our remaining secondary insurers. Our claims under our then
    existing insurance arrangements included both physical damages
    and business interruption claims. As of December 31, 2008,
    we had utilized $424 million of these proceeds as
    reimbursement of repair costs and deductible amounts, resulting
    in excess recoveries. The $162 million of excess recoveries
    was recorded as other income during 2008.

The following table presents our total income tax (benefit)

    differ from the U.S. statutory rate, are discussed below.

For 2008, our effective income tax rate differed from the
    U.S. statutory income tax rate largely due to two related
    factors. First, during 2008, we repatriated $2.6 billion
    from certain foreign subsidiaries to the



United States. Second, we made certain tax policy election
    changes in the second quarter of 2008 to minimize the taxes we
    otherwise would pay for the cash repatriations, as well as the
    taxable gains associated with the sales of assets in West
    Africa. As a result of the repatriation and tax policy election
    changes, we recognized additional tax expense of
    $307 million during 2008. Of the $307 million,
    $290 million was recognized as current income tax expense,
    and $17 million was recognized as deferred tax expense.
    Excluding the $307 million of additional tax expense, our
    effective income tax benefit rate would have been 32% for 2008.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, deferred income taxes were reduced
    $7 million, $261 million and $243 million,
    respectively, due to successive Canadian statutory rate
    reductions that were enacted in each such year.

In 2006, deferred income taxes increased $39 million due to
    the effect of a new income-based tax enacted by the state of
    Texas that replaced a previous franchise tax. The new tax was
    effective January 1, 2007.

Earnings
    From Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations consist of our operations in Egypt
    and West Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Cote
    d’Ivoire, Gabon and other countries in the region.

In October 2007, we completed the sale of our Egyptian
    operations and received proceeds of $341 million. As a
    result of this sale, we recognized a $90 million after-tax
    gain in the fourth quarter of 2007.

In the second quarter of 2008, we sold our assets and terminated
    our operations in certain West African countries, consisting
    primarily of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. As a result of the
    sales, we recognized gains totaling $736 million
    ($674 million after income taxes) in 2008 from proceeds of
    $2.4 billion ($1.7 billion net of income taxes and
    purchase price adjustments).

In the third quarter of 2008, we sold our assets and terminated
    our operations in Cote d’Ivoire. As a result of this sale,
    we recognized a gain of $83 million ($95 million after
    income taxes) in 2008 from proceeds of $205 million
    ($163 million net of income taxes and purchase price
    adjustments).

With the Cote d’Ivoire transaction, we completed the
    divestiture of all our oil and gas producing properties in
    Africa. The Africa divestitures generated just over
    $3.0 billion of sales proceeds. After income taxes and
    purchase price adjustments, such proceeds totaled
    $2.2 billion and generated after-tax gains of
    $0.8 billion.

Following are the components of earnings from discontinued
    operations between 2006 and 2008.

2008 vs. 2007

Earnings from discontinued operations
    increased $471 million in 2008. Earnings in 2008 included
    $769 million of after-tax divestiture gains as discussed
    above. This was $679 million more than the $90 million
    after-tax gain from the sale of our Egyptian operations in 2007.
    The increase in 2008 was partially offset by a decrease of
    $212 million from reduced earnings due to the timing of the
    2008 and 2007 divestitures.

2007 vs. 2006

Earnings from discontinued operations
    increased $248 million in 2007. In addition to variances
    caused by changes in production volumes and realized prices, our
    earnings from discontinued operations in 2007 were impacted by
    other significant factors. Pursuant to accounting rules for
    discontinued operations, we ceased recording DD&A in
    November 2006 related to our Egyptian operations and in January
    2007 related to our West African operations. This reduction in
    DD&A caused earnings from discontinued operations to
    increase $119 million in 2007. Earnings in 2007 also
    benefited from the $90 million gain from the sale of our
    Egyptian operations.



In addition, earnings from discontinued operations increased
    $90 million in 2007 due to the net effect of reductions in
    carrying value in 2006 and 2007. Our earnings in 2007 were
    reduced by $13 million from these reductions, compared to
    $103 million of reductions recorded in 2006. Due to
    unsuccessful drilling activities in Nigeria, in the first
    quarter of 2006, we recognized an $85 million impairment of
    our investment in Nigeria equal to the costs to drill two dry
    holes and a proportionate share of block-related costs. There
    was no income tax benefit related to this impairment. As a
    result of unsuccessful exploratory activities in Egypt during
    2006, the net book value of our Egyptian oil and gas properties,
    less related deferred income taxes, exceeded the ceiling by
    $18 million as of the end of September 30, 2006.
    Therefore, in 2006 we recognized an $18 million after-tax
    loss ($31 million pre-tax). In the second quarter of 2007,
    based on drilling activities in Nigeria, we recognized a
    $13 million after-tax loss ($64 million pre-tax).

Operating
    Cash Flow — Continuing Operations

Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash
    flow”) continued to be our primary source of capital and
    liquidity in 2008. Changes in operating cash flow are largely
    due to the same factors that affect our net earnings, with the
    exception of those earnings changes due to such noncash expenses
    as DD&A, financial instrument fair value changes, property
    impairments and deferred income taxes. As a result, our
    operating cash flow increased 50% during 2008 primarily due to
    the $3.0 billion increase in oil, gas and NGL revenues, net
    of commodity hedge settlements, as discussed in the
    “Results of Operations” section of this report.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, our capital expenditures were
    primarily funded by our operating cash flow. In 2006, we used a
    combination of commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the
    sale of short-term investments to fund the $2.0 billion
    Chief acquisition in June 2006.

Other
    Sources of Cash

As needed, we utilize cash on hand and access our credit
    facilities and commercial paper program as sources of cash to
    supplement the liquidity provided by our operating cash flow.
    Additionally, we sometimes acquire short-term investments to
    maximize our income on available cash balances. As needed, we
    may reduce such short-term investment balances to further
    supplement our operating cash flow.

During 2008, we reduced our short-term investment balances by
    $250 million. We also received $280 million from the
    exchange of our investment in Chevron common stock,
    $117 million from the sale of non-oil and gas property and
    equipment and $116 million from stock option exercises.
    Another significant source of cash was our African divestiture
    program. In the second and third quarters of 2008, we received
    $2.6 billion in proceeds ($1.9 billion net of income
    taxes and purchase price adjustments) from sales of assets
    located in Equatorial Guinea and other West African countries.
    Also, in conjunction with these asset sales, we repatriated an
    additional $2.6 billion of earnings from certain foreign
    subsidiaries to the United States.

We used these combined sources of cash in 2008 to fund debt
    repayments, common stock repurchases, redemptions of preferred
    stock and dividends on common and preferred stock.

During 2007, we borrowed $1.5 billion under our unsecured
    revolving line of credit and reduced our short-term investment
    balances by $202 million. We also received
    $341 million of proceeds from the sale of our Egyptian
    operations. These sources of cash were used primarily to fund
    net commercial paper repayments, long-term debt repayments,
    common stock repurchases and dividends on common and preferred
    stock.

During 2006, we borrowed $1.8 billion under our commercial
    paper program and reduced our short-term investment balances by
    $106 million. These sources of cash were largely used to
    fund the $2.0 billion acquisition of Chief in June 2006.
    Also during 2006, we supplemented operating cash flow with cash
    on hand, which was used to fund scheduled long-term debt
    maturities, common stock repurchases and dividends on common and
    preferred stock.

Our capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil
    and gas exploration and development operations, our midstream
    operations and other corporate activities. The vast majority of
    our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling or
    development of oil and gas properties, which totaled
    $8.7 billion, $5.6 billion and $6.8 billion in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 capital expenditures
    include $2.6 billion related to acquisitions of properties
    in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Canada. The 2006 capital
    expenditures include $2.0 billion related to the
    acquisition of the Chief properties. Excluding the effect of
    these acquisitions, the increase in capital expenditures from
    2006 to 2008 was due to increased drilling activities in the
    Barnett Shale, Gulf of Mexico, Carthage, Cana, Woodford Shale,
    Groesbeck and Washakie areas of the United States, the
    Lloydminster and Jackfish projects in Canada, and in the Polvo
    development in Brazil. Expenditures also increased due to
    inflationary pressure driven by increased competition for field
    services.

Our capital expenditures for our midstream operations are
    primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas
    processing plants, natural gas pipeline systems and oil
    pipelines. These midstream facilities exist primarily to support
    our oil and gas development operations. The majority of our
    midstream expenditures from 2006 to 2008 were related to
    development activities in the Barnett Shale, the Woodford Shale
    in southeastern Oklahoma and Jackfish in Canada.

Debt
    Repayments

During 2008, we repaid $1.5 billion in outstanding credit
    facility borrowings primarily with proceeds received from the
    sales of assets under our African divestiture program. Also
    during 2008, virtually all holders of exchangeable debentures
    exercised their option to exchange their debentures for shares
    of Chevron common stock owned by us. The debentures matured on
    August 15, 2008. In lieu of delivering our shares of
    Chevron common stock, we exercised our option to pay the
    exchanging debenture holders cash totaling $1.0 billion.
    This amount included the retirement of debentures with a book
    value of $652 million and a $379 million payment of
    the related embedded derivative option.

During 2007, we repaid the $400 million 4.375% notes,
    which matured on October 1, 2007. Also during 2007, certain
    holders of exchangeable debentures exercised their option to
    exchange their debentures for shares of Chevron common stock
    prior to the debentures’ August 15, 2008 maturity
    date. In lieu of delivering shares of Chevron common stock, we
    exercised our option to pay the exchanging debenture holders an
    amount of cash equal to the market value of Chevron common
    stock. We paid $167 million in cash to exchangeable
    debenture holders who exercised their exchange rights. This
    amount included the retirement of debentures with a book value
    of $105 million and a $62 million payment of the
    related embedded derivative option.

During 2006, we retired the $500 million 2.75% notes
    and the $178 million ($200 million Canadian)
    6.55% senior notes. We also repaid $180 million of
    debt acquired in the Chief acquisition.

Repurchases
    of Common Stock

During the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, we
    repurchased 14.8 million shares at a total cost of
    $1.2 billion, or $83.98 per share, under various repurchase
    programs. During 2008, we repurchased 6.5 million shares at
    a cost of $665 million, or $102.56 per share. During 2007,
    we repurchased 4.1 million shares at a cost of
    $326 million, or $79.80 per share. During 2006, we
    repurchased 4.2 million shares at a cost of
    $253 million, or $59.61 per share.

Redemption
    of Preferred Stock

On June 20, 2008, we redeemed all 1.5 million
    outstanding shares of our 6.49% Series A cumulative
    preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock was redeemed for
    cash at a redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends up to the redemption date.



Dividends

Our common stock dividends were $284 million (or a
    quarterly rate of $0.16 per share), $249 million (or a
    quarterly rate of $0.14 per share) and $199 million (or a
    quarterly rate of $0.1125) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Common dividends increased primarily due to the higher quarterly
    dividend rates.

We also paid $5 million of preferred stock dividends in
    2008 and $10 million of preferred stock dividends in both
    2007 and 2006. The decrease in the preferred dividends in 2008
    was due to the redemption of our preferred stock in the second
    quarter of 2008.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has
    been operating cash flow. During 2008, we repatriated earnings
    from certain foreign subsidiaries to the United States in
    conjunction with the divestitures of our assets in West Africa.
    Subsequent to these repatriations, we do not expect to
    repatriate similar earnings from our historical operations in
    the foreseeable future. Additionally, we maintain revolving
    lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be
    accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other
    available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance
    of equity securities and long-term debt. We expect the
    combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund
    future capital expenditures, debt repayments and other
    contractual commitments as discussed later in this section.

Operating
    Cash Flow

Our operating cash flow has increased approximately 73% since
    2006, reaching a total of $9.3 billion in 2008. We expect
    operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of
    liquidity. Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many
    variables, the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil, gas
    and NGLs we produce.

Commodity Prices

— Prices for oil, gas and NGLs
    are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions.
    Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other
    substantially variable factors influence market conditions for
    these products. These factors, which are difficult to predict,
    create volatility in oil, gas and NGL prices and are beyond our
    control. Although we expect this volatility to continue
    throughout 2009, we expect 2009 oil, gas and NGL prices will be
    noticeably lower than those for 2008. The corresponding
    reduction in our operating cash flow will require us to scale
    back certain uses of cash during 2009 compared to 2008,
    including most notably our capital expenditures.

To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we have
    utilized various price collars to set minimum and maximum prices
    on a portion of our production. We have also utilized various
    price swap contracts and fixed-price physical delivery contracts
    to fix the price of a portion of our future oil and gas
    production. Based on contracts in place as of February 16,
    2009, in 2009 approximately 10% of our estimated gas production
    is subject to either price collars or fixed-price contracts. The
    key terms of these contracts are summarized in
    “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    about Market Risk.”

Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through
    an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity
    price increases, as experienced in recent years, can lead to an
    increase in drilling and development activities. As a result,
    the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and
    materials may also increase, causing a negative impact on our
    cash flow. However, the inverse is also true during periods of
    depressed commodity prices such as what we are currently
    experiencing.

Interest Rates

— Our operating cash flow can
    also be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. As of
    January 31, 2009, we had long-term debt of
    $6.2 billion. This included $6.0 billion of fixed-rate
    debt and $0.2 billion of variable-rate commercial paper
    borrowings. The fixed-rate debt bears interest at an overall
    weighted average rate of 7.23%. We also have interest rate swaps
    to mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate
    fluctuations on our fixed-rate debt. Under the terms of these
    swaps, we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a
    total notional amount of $1.05 billion. Including the
    effects of these swaps, the weighted-average interest rate
    related to our fixed-rate debt was 6.64% as of January 31,
    2009. The key terms of these interest rate swaps are included in
    “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of
    Market Risk.”



Credit Losses

— Our operating cash flow is also
    exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. We are exposed to
    the credit risk of the customers who purchase our oil, gas and
    NGL production. We are also exposed to credit risk related to
    the collection of receivables from our joint-interest partners
    for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects
    we operate. We are also exposed to the credit risk of
    counterparties to our derivative financial contracts as
    discussed previously in this report.

The recent deterioration of the global financial and capital
    markets, combined with the drop in commodity prices, has
    increased our credit risk exposure. However, we utilize a
    variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks
    of our customers, partners and counterparties. Such mechanisms
    include, under certain conditions, prepayment requirements for
    commodity sales and collateral posting requirements in our
    existing derivative contracts.

Credit
    Availability

We have two revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper
    program that we intend to access during 2009 to provide
    liquidity. Although we are reducing our planned 2009 capital
    expenditures, we anticipate our operating cash flow in 2009 will
    be approximately $1.0 billion less than our capital
    expenditures due to significantly lower commodity prices.

We have a $2.65 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving
    line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The
    maturity date for $2.15 billion of the Senior Credit
    Facility is April 7, 2013. The maturity date for the
    remaining $0.5 billion is April 7, 2012. All amounts
    outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity
    dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, we have the option to extend the maturity of
    the Senior Credit Facility for one year, subject to the approval
    of the lenders. The Senior Credit Facility includes a revolving
    Canadian subfacility in a maximum amount of
    U.S. $500 million.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at our
    election, bear interest at various fixed rate options for
    periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally less
    than the prime rate. However, we may elect to borrow at the
    prime rate. As of January 31, 2009, there were no
    borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.

On November 5, 2008, we established a new $700 million

364-day,

syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the
    “Short-Term Facility”). The Short-Term Facility
    provides us with incremental liquidity for near-term capital
    expenditures.

The Short-Term Facility matures on November 3, 2009. On the
    maturity date, all amounts outstanding will be due and payable
    at that time. Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Facility
    bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to
    12 months. Such rates are generally based on LIBOR or the
    prime rate. As of January 31, 2009, there were no
    borrowings under the Short-Term Facility.

We also have access to short-term credit under our commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $2.85 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility or the Short-Term Facility on a
    dollar-for-dollar basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a
    maturity of between one and 90 days, although it can have a
    maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates
    agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is
    based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR,
    or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper
    market. As of January 31, 2009, we had $0.2 billion of
    commercial paper debt outstanding at an average rate of 3.33%.

The Senior Credit Facility and Short-Term Facility contain only
    one material financial covenant. This covenant requires our
    ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less
    than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions of total
    funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to
    the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back
    noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling
    impairments or goodwill impairments. As of December 31,
    2008, we were in compliance with this covenant. Our
    debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2008, as
    calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 18.6%.



Our access to funds from the Senior Credit Facility and
    Short-Term Facility is not restricted under any “material
    adverse effect” clauses. It is not uncommon for credit
    agreements to include such clauses. These clauses can remove the
    obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition
    or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and
    adverse effect on the borrower’s financial condition,
    operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the
    borrower’s ability to make timely debt payments, or the
    enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. While
    our credit facilities include covenants that require us to
    report a condition or event having a material adverse effect,
    the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not
    conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.

The following schedule summarizes the capacity of our credit
    facilities by maturity date, as well as our available capacity
    as of January 31, 2009.

Debt
    Ratings

We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the
    United States. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies
    consider a number of items including, but not limited to, debt
    levels, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production
    growth opportunities and capital allocation challenges.
    Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix, and
    commodity pricing levels are also considered by the rating
    agencies. Our current debt ratings are BBB+ with a stable
    outlook by both Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, and
    Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moody’s.

There are no “rating triggers” in any of our
    contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled
    maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level.
    Our cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility is
    predicated on our corporate debt rating. Therefore, even though
    a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities,
    it would adversely impact the interest rate on any borrowings
    under our Senior Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Senior
    Credit Facility, a one-notch downgrade would increase the
    fully-drawn borrowing costs from LIBOR plus 35 basis points
    to a new rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. A ratings
    downgrade could also adversely impact our ability to
    economically access debt markets in the future. As of
    December 31, 2008, we were not aware of any potential
    ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies.

Capital
    Expenditures

In February 2009, we provided guidance for our 2009 capital
    expenditures, which are expected to range from $4.7 billion
    to $5.4 billion. This estimate is significantly lower than
    our 2008 capital expenditures, which coincides with the
    significant decline in current oil, gas and NGL prices, as well
    as the near-term price expectations. To a certain degree, the
    ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our
    control. Therefore, if oil and gas prices fluctuate from current
    estimates, we could choose to defer a portion of these planned
    2009 capital expenditures until later periods, or accelerate
    capital expenditures planned for periods



beyond 2009 to achieve the desired balance between sources and
    uses of liquidity. Based upon current price expectations for
    2009 and the commodity price collars and fixed-price contracts
    we have in place, we anticipate having adequate capital
    resources to fund our 2009 capital expenditures.

Common
    Stock Repurchase Programs

We have an ongoing, annual stock repurchase program to minimize
    dilution resulting from restricted stock issued to, and options
    exercised by, employees. In 2009, the repurchase program
    authorizes the repurchase of up to 4.8 million shares or a
    cost of $360 million, whichever amount is reached first.

In anticipation of the completion of our West African
    divestitures, our Board of Directors approved a separate program
    to repurchase up to 50 million shares. This program expires
    on December 31, 2009.

In response to the current economic environment and recent
    downturn in commodity prices, we have indefinitely suspended
    activity under both these programs. As a result, we do not
    anticipate repurchasing shares under these programs in the
    foreseeable future. Should economic conditions or commodity
    prices strengthen, we will consider resumption of share
    repurchases under our authorized programs.

Pension
    Funding and Estimates

Funded Status.

As compared to the projected
    benefit obligation, our qualified and nonqualified defined
    benefit plans were underfunded by $501 million and
    $230 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. A detailed reconciliation of the 2008 changes to
    our underfunded status is included in Note 8 to the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. Of the
    $501 million underfunded status at the end of 2008,
    $211 million is attributable to various nonqualified
    defined benefit plans that have no plan assets. However, we have
    established certain trusts to fund the benefit obligations of
    such nonqualified plans. As of December 31, 2008, these
    trusts had investments with a fair value of $50 million.
    The value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets
    in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

As compared to the accumulated benefit obligation, our qualified
    defined benefit plans were underfunded by $209 million at
    December 31, 2008. The accumulated benefit obligation
    differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former
    includes no assumption about future compensation levels.

Our funding policy regarding the qualified defined benefit plans
    is to contribute the amounts necessary for the plans’
    assets to approximately equal the present value of benefits
    earned by the participants, as calculated in accordance with the
    provisions of the Pension Protection Act (“PPA”).
    During 2008, investment losses significantly reduced the value
    of our plans’ assets. This decrease was the primary
    contributor to the significant decrease in the funded status of
    our pension plans during 2008. The 2008 investment losses,
    combined with our target funding levels, will cause our 2009
    contributions to be higher than those made in recent years. We
    estimate we will contribute up to approximately
    $173 million to our qualified pension plans during 2009.
    However, actual contributions may be less than this amount.

Pension Estimate Assumptions.

Our pension
    expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’
    approximate service periods and is impacted by funding decisions
    or requirements. We recognized expense for our defined benefit
    pension plans of $61 million, $41 million and
    $31 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,



respectively. We estimate that our pension expense will
    approximate $114 million in 2009. Should our actual 2009
    contributions vary significantly from our current estimate of
    $173 million, our actual 2009 pension expense could vary
    from this estimate.

The calculation of pension expense and pension liability
    requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these
    assumptions can result in different expense and liability
    amounts, and actual experience can differ from the assumptions.
    We believe that the two most critical assumptions affecting
    pension expense and liabilities are the expected long-term rate
    of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

We assumed that our plan assets would generate a long-term
    weighted average rate of return of 7.25% and 8.40% at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We developed
    these expected long-term rate of return assumptions by
    evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. The expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of
    investment types in such assets. At December 31, 2008, the
    target investment allocation for our plan assets is 30%
    U.S. large cap equity securities; 15% U.S. small cap
    equity securities, equally allocated between growth and value;
    15% international equity securities, equally allocated between
    growth and value; and 40% debt securities. The target investment
    allocation for our plan assets at December 31, 2007, was
    50% U.S. large cap equity securities; 15% U.S. small
    cap equity securities, equally allocated between growth and
    value; 15% international equity securities, equally allocated
    between growth and value; and 20% debt securities. We expect our
    long-term asset allocation on average to approximate the
    targeted allocation. We regularly review our actual asset
    allocation and periodically rebalance the investments to the
    targeted allocation when considered appropriate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan
    assets decreases. A decrease in our long-term rate of return
    assumption of 100 basis points (from 7.25% to 6.25%) would
    increase the expected 2009 pension expense by $5 million.

We discounted our future pension obligations using a weighted
    average rate of 6.00% and 6.22% at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The discount rate is determined at the end
    of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be
    effectively settled, considering the expected timing of future
    cash flows related to the plans. This rate is based on
    high-quality bond yields, after allowing for call and default
    risk. We consider high quality corporate bond yield indices,
    such as Moody’s Aa, when selecting the discount rate.

The pension liability and future pension expense both increase
    as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by
    25 basis points (from 6.00% to 5.75%) would increase our
    pension liability at December 31, 2008, by
    $31 million, and increase estimated 2009 pension expense by
    $5 million.

At December 31, 2008, we had net actuarial losses of
    $440 million, which will be recognized as a component of
    pension expense in future years. These losses are primarily due
    to the large investment losses on plan assets in 2008,
    reductions in the discount rate since 2001 and increases in
    participant wages. We estimate that approximately
    $45 million and $41 million of the unrecognized
    actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in 2009 and
    2010, respectively. The $45 million estimated to be
    recognized in 2009 is a component of the total estimated 2009
    pension expense of $114 million referred to earlier in this
    section.

Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and
    various other factors related to the participants in our defined
    benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and
    liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors
    will be in the future.

Contingencies
    and Legal Matters

For a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters,
    see Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported



amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these
    estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when
    known.

The critical accounting policies used by management in the
    preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those
    that are important both to the presentation of our financial
    condition and results of operations and require significant
    judgments by management with regard to estimates used. Our
    critical accounting policies and significant judgments and
    estimates related to those policies are described below. We have
    reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Audit
    Committee of our Board of Directors.

Full
    Cost Ceiling Calculations

Policy
    Description

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas
    properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
    calculations of a “ceiling,” or limitation on the
    amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance
    sheet. The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated
    after-tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas
    properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with
    settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book
    value of oil and gas properties, plus the cost of properties not
    subject to amortization. If our net book value of oil and gas
    properties, less related deferred income taxes, is in excess of
    the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written off as an
    expense, except as discussed in the following paragraph. The
    ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in
    which we have oil and gas properties. An expense recorded in one
    period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though
    higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling
    applicable to the subsequent period.

If, subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the
    applicable financial statements being published, prices increase
    to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be
    recovered, a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the
    quarter is not required to be recorded. A writedown indicated at
    the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of
    additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the
    quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements
    would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered,
    as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The discounted present value of future net revenues for our
    proved oil, gas and NGL reserves is a major component of the
    ceiling calculation, and represents the component that requires
    the most subjective judgments. Estimates of reserves are
    forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of
    production and the timing of future expenditures. The process of
    estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves requires substantial
    judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly
    for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make
    different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same
    data. Certain of our reserve estimates are prepared or audited
    by outside petroleum consultants, while other reserve estimates
    are prepared by our engineers. See Note 20 of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of
    the amount of our reserves that are prepared or audited by
    outside petroleum consultants.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information
    regarding estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior
    estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five
    years, annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates,
    which have been both increases and decreases in individual
    years, have averaged less than 2% of the previous year’s
    estimate. However, there can be no assurance that more
    significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. If
    future significant revisions are necessary that reduce
    previously estimated reserve quantities, it could result in a
    full cost property writedown. In addition to the impact of the
    estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling,
    estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of
    the calculation of DD&A.

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial
    judgment, the associated prices of oil, gas and NGL reserves,
    and the applicable discount rate, that are used to calculate the
    discounted present value of the reserves do not require
    judgment. The ceiling calculation dictates that a 10% discount
    factor be used and that



prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are
    held constant indefinitely. Therefore, the future net revenues
    associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on
    our assessment of future prices or costs. Rather, they are based
    on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter
    when the ceiling calculation is performed. In calculating the
    ceiling, we adjust the end-of-period price by the effect of
    derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge accounting
    treatment. This adjustment requires little judgment as the
    end-of-period price is adjusted using the contract prices for
    such hedges. None of our outstanding derivative contracts at
    December 31, 2008 qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect
    as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant
    indefinitely, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting
    value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.
    Oil and gas prices have historically been volatile. On any
    particular day at the end of a quarter, prices can be either
    substantially higher or lower than our long-term price forecast
    that is a barometer for true fair value. Therefore, oil and gas
    property writedowns that result from applying the full cost
    ceiling limitation, and that are caused by fluctuations in price
    as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of
    reserves, should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a
    reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves.

Because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not
    possible to predict the timing or magnitude of full cost
    writedowns. However, considering current and near-term estimates
    of oil and gas prices, such writedowns may be more likely to
    occur during 2009 than in recent periods.

The SEC recently revised the requirement to use quarter-end
    prices to calculate the full cost ceiling. Beginning on
    December 31, 2009, the ceiling will be calculated using a

12-month

average price. See “Modernization of Oil and Gas
    Reporting” for more information on the SEC’s revised
    rules.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Policy
    Description

We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with
    respect to a portion of our oil and gas production that hedge
    the future prices received. These instruments are used to manage
    the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil and gas
    price volatility. Our derivative financial instruments include
    financial price swaps and costless price collars. Under the
    terms of the swaps, we will receive a fixed price for our
    production and pay a variable market price to the contract
    counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price
    for the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price
    indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling
    prices in the various collars, we will cash-settle the
    difference with the counterparty to the collars.

We periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our
    exposure to interest rate volatility. We use these swaps to
    mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate
    fluctuations on our fixed-rate debt. Under the terms of these
    swaps, we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a
    total notional amount.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
    such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If such criteria are met for
    fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is recorded in
    the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded
    for the change in fair value of the hedged item. Cash
    settlements with counterparties to our derivative financial
    instruments also increase or decrease earnings at the time of
    the settlement.

A derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment if we designate the instrument as such on the date the
    derivative contract is entered into or the date of a business
    combination or other transaction that includes derivative
    contracts. Additionally, we must document the relationship
    between the



hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as the
    risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    instrument. We must also assess, both at the instrument’s
    inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative is
    highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow of the
    hedged item. For derivative financial instruments held during
    2008, 2007 and 2006, we chose not to meet the necessary criteria
    to qualify our derivative financial instruments for hedge
    accounting treatment.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments
    require substantial judgment. We estimate the fair values of our
    oil and gas derivative financial instruments primarily by using
    internal discounted cash flow calculations. The most significant
    variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future
    commodity prices. We base our estimate of future prices upon
    published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC
    Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West
    Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Another
    key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of
    volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily
    upon implied volatility. The resulting estimated future cash
    inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts are
    discounted using LIBOR and money market futures rates for the
    first year and money market futures and swap rates thereafter.
    These pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to the
    period of the contract and market volatility as well as changes
    in forward prices and regional price differentials.

We estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial
    instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow
    calculations based upon forward interest-rate yields. The most
    significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our
    estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our estimate of
    future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward
    curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by
    third parties. Another key input to our cash flow calculations
    is our estimate of volatility for these forward yields, which we
    base primarily upon implied volatility. The resulting estimated
    future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the contracts
    are discounted using LIBOR and money market futures rates for
    the first year and money market futures and swap rates
    thereafter. These yield and discounting variables are sensitive
    to the period of the contract and market volatility as well as
    changes in forward interest rate yields.

From time to time, we validate our valuation techniques by
    comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with
    those obtained from contract counterparties

and/or

brokers.

In spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets,
    counterparty credit risk has not had a significant effect on our
    cash flow calculations and derivative valuations. This is
    primarily the result of two factors. First, we have mitigated
    our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with
    numerous counterparties. Our commodity derivative contracts are
    held with eight separate counterparties, and our interest rate
    derivative contracts are held with five separate counterparties.
    Second, our derivative contracts generally require cash
    collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s
    credit rating falls below “investment grade”. The
    threshold for collateral posting decreases as the debt rating
    falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally
    range from zero to $50 million for the majority of our
    contracts. As of December 31, 2008, the credit ratings of
    all our counterparties were investment grade.

Quarterly changes in our derivative fair value estimates have
    only a minimal impact on our liquidity, capital resources or
    results of operations, as long as the derivative instruments
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair
    values of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
    treatment can have a significant impact on our results of
    operations, but generally will not impact our liquidity or
    capital resources.

Settlements of derivative instruments, regardless of whether
    they qualify for hedge accounting, do have an impact on our
    liquidity and results of operations. Generally, if actual market
    prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments,
    our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower
    relative to the results that would have occurred absent these
    instruments. The opposite is also true. Additional information
    regarding the effects that changes in market prices can have on
    our derivative financial instruments, net earnings and cash flow
    from operations is included in “Item 7A. Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”



Business
    Combinations

Policy
    Description

From our beginning as a public company in 1988 through 2003, we
    grew substantially through acquisitions of other oil and gas
    companies. Most of these acquisitions have been accounted for
    using the purchase method of accounting. Current accounting
    pronouncements require the purchase method to be used to account
    for any future acquisitions.

Under the purchase method, the acquiring company adds to its
    balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired
    company’s assets and liabilities. Any excess of the
    purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and
    intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
    is assessed for impairment at least annually.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

There are various assumptions we make in determining the fair
    values of an acquired company’s assets and liabilities. The
    most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most
    judgment, involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas
    properties acquired. To determine the fair values of these
    properties, we prepare estimates of oil, gas and NGL reserves.
    These estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and
    that of outside consultants. The judgments associated with these
    estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in
    connection with the full cost ceiling calculation.

However, there are factors involved in estimating the fair
    values of acquired oil, gas and NGL properties that require more
    judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling
    calculation. As stated above, the full cost ceiling calculation
    applies end-of-period price and cost information to the reserves
    to arrive at the ceiling amount. By contrast, the fair value of
    reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on our
    estimates of future oil, gas and NGL prices. Our estimates of
    future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends.
    These estimates are based on current data obtained with regard
    to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as
    economic growth forecasts. They are also based on industry data
    regarding gas storage availability, drilling rig activity,
    changes in delivery capacity, trends in regional pricing
    differentials and other fundamental analysis. Forecasts of
    future prices from independent third parties are noted when we
    make our pricing estimates.

We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve
    quantities acquired, and estimate future operating and
    development costs, to arrive at estimates of future net
    revenues. For estimated proved reserves, the future net revenues
    are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the
    time of the business combination based upon our cost of capital.

We also apply these same general principles to estimate the fair
    value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination.
    These unproved properties generally represent the value of
    probable and possible reserves. Because of their very nature,
    probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than
    those of proved reserves. To compensate for the inherent risk of
    estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future
    net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by
    what we consider to be an appropriate risk-weighting factor in
    each particular instance. It is common for the discounted future
    net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by
    factors ranging from 30% to 80% to arrive at what we consider to
    be the appropriate fair values.

Generally, in our business combinations, the determination of
    the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more
    judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities.
    The acquired companies commonly have long-term debt that we
    assume in the acquisition, and this debt must be recorded at the
    estimated fair value as if we had issued such debt. However,
    significant judgment on our behalf is usually not required in
    these situations due to the existence of comparable market
    values of debt issued by peer companies.

Except for the 2002 acquisition of Mitchell Energy &
    Development Corp., our mergers and acquisitions have involved
    other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area
    of exploration, development and



production activities related to oil and gas properties.
    However, in addition to exploration, development and production
    activities, Mitchell’s business also included substantial
    marketing and midstream activities. Therefore, a portion of the
    Mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of
    Mitchell’s marketing and midstream facilities and
    equipment. This consisted primarily of natural gas processing
    plants and natural gas pipeline systems.

The Mitchell midstream assets primarily serve gas producing
    properties that we also acquired from Mitchell. Therefore,
    certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the
    gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the
    midstream assets. For example, future quantities of gas
    estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were
    based on the same estimates used to value the proved and
    unproved gas producing properties. Future expected prices for
    marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price
    cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas
    producing assets acquired from Mitchell. Based on historical
    costs and known trends and commitments, we also estimated future
    operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream
    assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows. These cash
    flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to
    discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets
    to arrive at our estimated fair value of the marketing and
    midstream facilities and equipment.

In addition to the valuation methods described above, we perform
    other quantitative analyses to support the indicated value in
    any business combination. These analyses include information
    related to comparable companies, comparable transactions and
    premiums paid.

In a comparable companies analysis, we review the public stock
    market trading multiples for selected publicly traded
    independent exploration and production companies with comparable
    financial and operating characteristics. Such characteristics
    are market capitalization, location of proved reserves and the
    characterization of those reserves that we deem to be similar to
    those of the party to the proposed business combination. We
    compare these comparable company multiples to the proposed
    business combination company multiples for reasonableness.

In a comparable transactions analysis, we review certain
    acquisition multiples for selected independent exploration and
    production company transactions and oil and gas asset packages
    announced recently. We compare these comparable transaction
    multiples to the proposed business combination transaction
    multiples for reasonableness.

In a premiums paid analysis, we use a sample of selected
    independent exploration and production company transactions in
    addition to selected transactions of all publicly traded
    companies announced recently, to review the premiums paid to the
    price of the target one day, one week and one month prior to the
    announcement of the transaction. We use this information to
    determine the mean and median premiums paid and compare them to
    the proposed business combination premium for reasonableness.

While these estimates of fair value for the various assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on our liquidity
    or capital resources, they can have an effect on the future
    results of operations. Generally, the higher the fair value
    assigned to both the oil and gas properties and non-oil and gas
    properties, the lower future net earnings will be as a result of
    higher future depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
    Also, a higher fair value assigned to the oil and gas
    properties, based on higher future estimates of oil and gas
    prices, will increase the likelihood of a full cost ceiling
    writedown in the event that subsequent oil and gas prices drop
    below our price forecast that was used to originally determine
    fair value. A full cost ceiling writedown would have no effect
    on our liquidity or capital resources in that period because it
    is a noncash charge, but it would adversely affect results of
    operations. As discussed in “Item 7. Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Capital Resources, Uses and
    Liquidity,” in calculating our debt-to-capitalization ratio
    under our credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to
    add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling
    property impairments or goodwill impairments.

Our estimates of reserve quantities are one of the many
    estimates that are involved in determining the appropriate fair
    value of the oil and gas properties acquired in a business
    combination. As previously disclosed in our discussion of the
    full cost ceiling calculations, during the past five years, our
    annual performance revisions to our reserve estimates have
    averaged less than 2%. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
    there



are numerous estimates in addition to reserve quantity estimates
    that are involved in determining the fair value of oil and gas
    properties acquired in a business combination. The
    inter-relationship of these estimates makes it impractical to
    provide additional quantitative analyses of the effects of
    changes in these estimates.

Valuation
    of Goodwill

Policy
    Description

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense.

Judgments
    and Assumptions

The annual impairment test requires us to estimate the fair
    values of our own assets and liabilities. Because quoted market
    prices are not available for Devon’s reporting units, the
    fair values of the reporting units are estimated in a manner
    similar to the process described above for a business
    combination. Therefore, considerable judgment similar to that
    described above in connection with estimating the fair value of
    an acquired company in a business combination is also required
    to assess goodwill for impairment.

Generally, the higher the fair value assigned to both the oil
    and gas properties and non-oil and gas properties, the lower
    goodwill would be. A lower goodwill value decreases the
    likelihood of an impairment charge. However, unfavorable changes
    in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the
    likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge. A goodwill
    impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital
    resources. However, it would adversely affect our results of
    operations in that period.

Due to the inter-relationship of the various estimates involved
    in assessing goodwill for impairment, it is impractical to
    provide quantitative analyses of the effects of potential
    changes in these estimates, other than to note the historical
    average changes in our reserve estimates previously set forth.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

, which
    replaces Statement No. 141. Statement No. 141(R)
    retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141
    that an acquirer be identified and the acquisition method of
    accounting (previously called the purchase method) be used for
    all business combinations. Statement No. 141(R)’s
    scope is broader than that of Statement No. 141, which
    applied only to business combinations in which control was
    obtained by transferring consideration. By applying the
    acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses,
    Statement No. 141(R) improves the comparability of the
    information about business combinations provided in financial
    reports. Statement No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, as well as any
    resulting goodwill. Statement No. 141(R) applies
    prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We will
    evaluate how the new requirements of Statement No. 141(R)
    would impact any business combinations completed in 2009 or
    thereafter.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

. A
    noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest,
    is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,

    financial statement disclosures. However, our adoption of Staff
    Position 132(R)-1 will not affect our current accounting for our
    pension and postretirement plans.

Modernization
    of Oil and Gas Reporting

In December 2008, the SEC adopted revisions to its required oil
    and gas reporting disclosures. The revisions are intended to
    provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive
    understanding of oil and gas reserves. In the three decades that
    have passed since adoption of these disclosure items, there have
    been significant changes in the oil and gas industry. The
    amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas
    disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and
    changes in technology. In addition, the amendments concurrently
    align the SEC’s full cost accounting rules with the revised
    disclosures. The revised disclosure requirements must be
    incorporated in registration statements filed on or after
    January 1, 2010, and annual reports on

Form 10-K

for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. A
    company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly
    reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised
    disclosures are required.

The following amendments have the greatest likelihood of
    affecting our reserve disclosures, including the comparability
    of our reserves disclosures with those of our peer companies:

•

Pricing mechanism for oil and gas reserves estimation

— The SEC’s current rules require proved
    reserve estimates to be calculated using prices as of the end of
    the period and held constant over the life of the reserves.
    Price changes can be made only to the extent provided by
    contractual arrangements. The revised rules require reserve
    estimates to be calculated using a

12-month

average price. The

12-month

average price will also be used for purposes of calculating the
    full cost ceiling limitations. The use of a

12-month

average price rather than a

single-day

price is expected to reduce the impact on reserve estimates and
    the full cost ceiling limitations due to short-term volatility
    and seasonality of prices.

•

Reasonable certainty

— The SEC’s current
    definition of proved oil and gas reserves incorporate certain
    specific concepts such as “lowest known hydrocarbons,”
    which limits the ability to claim proved reserves in the absence
    of information on fluid contacts in a well penetration,
    notwithstanding the existence of other engineering and
    geoscientific evidence. The revised rules amend the definition
    to permit the use of new reliable technologies to establish the
    reasonable certainty of proved reserves. This revision also
    includes provisions for establishing levels of lowest known
    hydrocarbons and highest known oil through reliable technology
    other than well penetrations.

The revised rules also amend the definition of proved oil and
    gas reserves to include reserves located beyond development
    spacing areas that are immediately adjacent to developed spacing
    areas if economic producibility can be established with
    reasonable certainty. These revisions are designed to permit the
    use of alternative technologies to establish proved reserves in
    lieu of requiring companies to use specific tests. In addition,
    they establish a uniform standard of reasonable certainty that
    applies to all proved reserves, regardless of location or
    distance from producing wells.



Because the revised rules generally expand the definition of
    proved reserves, we expect our proved reserve estimates will
    increase upon adoption of the revised rules. However, we are not
    able to estimate the magnitude of the potential increase at this
    time.

•

Unproved reserves

— The SEC’s current
    rules prohibit disclosure of reserve estimates other than proved
    in documents filed with the SEC. The revised rules permit
    disclosure of probable and possible reserves and provide
    definitions of probable reserves and possible reserves.
    Disclosure of probable and possible reserves is optional.
    However, such disclosures must meet specific requirements.
    Disclosures of probable or possible reserves must provide the
    same level of geographic detail as proved reserves and must
    state whether the reserves are developed or undeveloped.
    Probable and possible reserve disclosures must also provide the
    relative uncertainty associated with these classifications of
    reserves estimations. We have not yet determined whether we will
    disclose our probable and possible reserves in documents filed
    with the SEC.

Forward-Looking
    Estimates

We are providing our 2009 forward-looking estimates in the
    following discussion. These estimates are based on our
    examination of historical operating trends, the information used
    to prepare our December 31, 2008 reserve reports and other
    data in our possession or available from third parties. The
    forward-looking estimates in this discussion were prepared
    assuming demand, curtailment, producibility and general market
    conditions for our oil, gas and NGLs during 2009 will be
    substantially similar to those that existed in 2008, unless
    otherwise noted. We make reference to the “Disclosure
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of
    this report. Amounts related to Canadian operations have been
    converted to U.S. dollars using a projected average 2009
    exchange rate of $0.80 U.S. dollar to $1.00 Canadian dollar.

Operating
    Items

Oil, Gas
    and NGL Production

Set forth below are our estimates of oil, gas and NGL production
    for 2009. We estimate that our combined 2009 oil, gas and NGL
    production will total approximately 235 to 241 MMBoe. Of
    this total, approximately 97% is estimated to be produced from
    reserves classified as “proved” at December 31,
    2008. The following estimates for oil, gas and NGL production
    are calculated at the midpoint of the estimated range for total
    production.

Oil and
    Gas Prices

We expect our 2009 average prices for the oil and gas production
    from each of our operating areas to differ from the NYMEX price
    as set forth in the following table. The expected ranges for gas
    prices are exclusive of the anticipated effects of the gas
    financial contracts presented in the “Commodity Price Risk
    Management” section below.



The NYMEX price for oil is the monthly average of settled prices
    on each trading day for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude
    oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma. The NYMEX price for gas is
    determined to be the first-of-month South Louisiana Henry Hub
    price index as published monthly in

Inside FERC.

Commodity
    Price Risk Management

From time to time, we enter into NYMEX related financial
    commodity collar and price swap contracts. Such contracts are
    used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due
    to oil and gas price volatility. Although these financial
    contracts do not relate to specific production from our
    operating areas, they will affect our overall revenues, earnings
    and cash flow in 2009.

As of February 3, 2009, our financial commodity contracts
    pertaining to 2009 consisted only of gas collars. The key terms
    of these contracts are presented in the following table.

To the extent that monthly NYMEX prices in 2009 are outside of
    the ranges established by the gas collars, we and the
    counterparties to the contracts will settle the difference. Such
    settlements will either increase or decrease our revenues for
    the period. Also, we will mark-to-market the contracts based on
    their fair values throughout 2009. Changes in the
    contracts’ fair values will also be recorded as increases
    or decreases to our revenues. The expected ranges of our
    realized gas prices as a percentage of NYMEX prices, which are
    presented earlier in this report, do not include any estimates
    of the impact on our gas prices from monthly settlements or
    changes in the fair values of our gas collars.

In January 2009, we entered into an early settlement arrangement
    with one of our counterparties. As a result of this early
    settlement, we received $36 million in January 2009.

Marketing
    and Midstream Revenues and Expenses

Marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived
    primarily from our gas processing plants and gas pipeline
    systems. These revenues and expenses vary in response to several
    factors. The factors include, but are not limited to, changes in
    production from wells connected to the pipelines and related
    processing plants, changes in the absolute and relative prices
    of gas and NGLs, provisions of contractual agreements and the
    amount of repair and maintenance activity required to maintain
    anticipated processing levels and pipeline throughput volumes.

These factors increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating
    future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses. Given
    these uncertainties, we estimate that our 2009 marketing and
    midstream operating profit will be between $375 million and
    $425 million. We estimate that marketing and midstream
    revenues will be



between $1.075 billion and $1.425 billion, and
    marketing and midstream expenses will be between
    $0.700 billion and $1.000 billion.

Production
    and Operating Expenses

Our production and operating expenses include lease operating
    expenses, transportation costs and production taxes. These
    expenses vary in response to several factors. Among the most
    significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from
    the property base, changes in the general price level of
    services and materials that are used in the operation of the
    properties, the amount of repair and workover activity required
    and changes in production tax rates. Oil, gas and NGL prices
    also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the
    economic feasibility of planned workover projects.

Given these uncertainties, we expect that our 2009 lease
    operating expenses will be between $1.93 billion and
    $2.27 billion. Additionally, we estimate that our
    production taxes for 2009 will be between 3.25% and 3.75% of
    total oil, gas and NGL revenues, excluding the effect on
    revenues from financial collar contracts upon which production
    taxes are not assessed.

Depreciation,
    Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”)

Our 2009 oil and gas property DD&A rate will depend on
    various factors. Most notable among such factors are the amount
    of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or
    acquisition efforts in 2009 compared to the costs incurred for
    such efforts and revisions to our year-end 2008 reserve
    estimates that, based on prior experience, are likely to be made
    during 2009. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2008
    included negative price revisions of 473 MMBoe. The
    following oil and gas property related DD&A estimates are
    largely based on the assumption that the year-end 2008 negative
    price revisions will not reverse during 2009. However, if such
    negative price revisions reverse, in whole or in part, our
    actual oil and gas property related DD&A rate could vary
    materially from our estimate.

Given these uncertainties, we estimate that our oil and gas
    property related DD&A rate will be between $10.25 per Boe
    and $10.75 per Boe. Based on these DD&A rates and the
    production estimates set forth earlier, oil and gas property
    related DD&A expense for 2009 is expected to be between
    $2.44 billion and $2.56 billion.

Additionally, we expect that our depreciation and amortization
    expense related to non-oil and gas property fixed assets will
    total between $315 million and $335 million in 2008.

Accretion
    of Asset Retirement Obligations

Accretion of asset retirement obligations in 2009 is expected to
    be between $85 million and $95 million.

General
    and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)

Our G&A includes employee compensation and benefits costs
    and the costs of many different goods and services used in
    support of our business. G&A varies with the level of our
    operating activities and the related staffing and professional
    services requirements. In addition, employee compensation and
    benefits costs vary due to various market factors that affect
    the level and type of compensation and benefits offered to
    employees. Also, goods and services are subject to general price
    level increases or decreases. Therefore, significant variances
    in any of these factors from current expectations could cause
    actual G&A to vary materially from the estimate.

Given these limitations, we estimate our G&A for 2009 will
    be between $565 million and $605 million. This
    estimate includes approximately $110 million of non-cash,
    share-based compensation, net of related capitalization in
    accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and
    gas properties.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

Because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, it is not
    possible to predict whether we will incur full cost writedowns
    in 2009. However, such writedowns may be more likely to occur
    during 2009 than in recent



periods, considering current and near-term estimates of oil and
    gas prices, which are generally expected to be lower than prices
    in existence prior to the fourth quarter of 2008.

We recognized full cost ceiling writedowns related to our oil
    and gas properties in the United States, Canada and Brazil in
    the fourth quarter of 2008. These writedowns resulted primarily
    from significant declines in oil and gas prices compared to
    previous quarter-end prices. The December 31, 2008 weighted
    average wellhead prices for these countries are presented in the
    following table.

The wellhead prices in the table above compare to the
    December 31, 2008 NYMEX cash price of $44.60 per Bbl for
    crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $5.71 per MMBtu for
    gas. Should 2009 quarter-end prices approximate or decrease from
    these December 31, 2008 prices, the likelihood that we will
    incur full cost writedowns during 2009 will increase.

Interest
    Expense

Future interest rates and debt outstanding have a significant
    effect on our interest expense. We can only marginally influence
    the prices we will receive in 2009 from sales of oil, gas and
    NGLs and the resulting cash flow. This increases the margin of
    error inherent in estimating future outstanding debt balances
    and related interest expense. Other factors which affect
    outstanding debt balances and related interest expense, such as
    the amount and timing of capital expenditures are generally
    within our control.

As of January 31, 2009, we had total debt of
    $6.2 billion. This included $6.0 billion of fixed-rate
    debt and $0.2 billion of variable-rate commercial paper
    borrowings. The fixed-rate debt bears interest at an overall
    weighted average rate of 7.23%. The commercial paper borrowings
    bear interest at variable rates based on a standard index such
    as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as
    found on the commercial paper market. As of January 31,
    2009, the weighted average variable rate for our commercial
    paper borrowings was 3.33%. Additionally, any future borrowings
    under our credit facilities would bear interest at various
    fixed-rate options for periods up to twelve months and are
    generally less than the prime rate.

Based on the factors above, we expect our 2009 interest expense
    to be between $330 million and $340 million. This
    estimate assumes no material changes in prevailing interest
    rates or to our existing interest rate swap contracts presented
    above. This estimate also assumes that our total debt will
    increase approximately $1.0 billion during 2009, primarily
    in the form of commercial paper borrowings.

The 2009 interest expense estimate above is comprised of three
    primary components — interest related to outstanding
    debt, fees and issuance costs, and capitalized interest. We
    expect the interest expense in 2009 related to our fixed-rate
    and floating-rate debt, including net accretion of related
    discounts, to be between $435 million and
    $445 million. We expect the interest expense in 2009
    related to facility and agency fees, amortization of debt
    issuance costs and other miscellaneous items not related to
    outstanding debt balances to be between $5 million and
    $15 million. We also expect to capitalize between
    $110 million and $120 million of interest during 2009.



Interest
    Rate Risk Management

We also have interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of the
    fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on our
    fixed-rate debt. Under the terms of these swaps, we receive a
    fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount of
    $1.05 billion. The key terms of these interest rate swaps
    are presented in the following table.

Including the effects of these swaps, the weighted-average
    interest rate related to our fixed-rate debt was 6.64% as of
    January 31, 2009.

Income
    Taxes

Our financial income tax rate in 2009 will vary materially
    depending on the actual amount of financial pre-tax earnings.
    The tax rate for 2009 will be significantly affected by the
    proportional share of consolidated pre-tax earnings generated by
    U.S., Canadian and International operations due to the different
    tax rates of each country. There are certain tax deductions and
    credits that will have a fixed impact on 2009 income tax expense
    regardless of the level of pre-tax earnings that are produced.

Given the uncertainty of pre-tax earnings, we expect that our
    consolidated financial income tax rate in 2009 will be between
    20% and 40%. The current income tax rate is expected to be
    between 10% and 20%. The deferred income tax rate is expected to
    be between 10% and 20%. Significant changes in estimated capital
    expenditures, production levels of oil, gas and NGLs, the prices
    of such products, marketing and midstream revenues, or any of
    the various expense items could materially alter the effect of
    the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on 2009 financial
    income tax rates.

Capital
    Resources, Uses and Liquidity

Capital
    Expenditures

Though we have completed several major property acquisitions in
    recent years, these transactions are opportunity driven. Thus,
    we do not “budget,” nor can we reasonably predict, the
    timing or size of such possible acquisitions.

Our capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of
    future oil, gas and NGL prices as well as the expected costs of
    the capital additions. Should actual prices received differ
    materially from our price expectations for our future
    production, some projects may be accelerated or deferred and,
    consequently, may increase or decrease total 2009 capital
    expenditures. In addition, if the actual material or labor costs
    of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated
    amounts, actual capital expenditures could vary materially from
    our estimates.

Given the limitations discussed above, the following table shows
    expected ranges for drilling, development and facilities
    expenditures by geographic area. Development capital includes
    development activity related to reserves classified as proved
    and drilling that does not offset currently productive units and
    for which there



is not a certainty of continued production from a known
    productive formation. Exploration capital includes exploratory
    drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested
    fault blocks or new reservoirs.

In addition to the above expenditures for drilling, development
    and facilities, we expect to spend between $325 million to
    $425 million on our marketing and midstream assets, which
    primarily include our oil pipelines, natural gas processing
    plants, and gas pipeline systems. Additionally, we expect to
    capitalize between $460 million and $480 million of
    G&A expenses in accordance with the full cost method of
    accounting and to capitalize between $110 million and
    $120 million of interest. We also expect to pay between
    $105 million and $115 million for plugging and
    abandonment charges, and to spend between $230 million and
    $250 million for other non-oil and gas property fixed
    assets. We anticipate spending between $40 million and
    $50 million to fulfill drilling commitments related to our
    assets held for sale.

Other
    Cash Uses

Our management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common
    stock dividend to continue. With the current $0.16 per share
    quarterly dividend rate and 444 million shares of common
    stock outstanding as of December 31, 2008, dividends are
    expected to approximate $284 million.

We have various defined benefit pension plans. The vast majority
    of these plans are subject to minimum funding requirements.
    During 2008, investment losses significantly reduced the funded
    status of these plans. Accordingly, our 2009 contributions to
    these plans are expected to be significantly higher than those
    made in recent years. Depending on the funding targets we may
    attempt to achieve, we estimate we will contribute between
    $100 million and $175 million to our pension plans
    during 2009.

Capital
    Resources and Liquidity

Our estimated 2009 cash uses, including our drilling and
    development activities and retirement of maturing debt, are
    expected to be funded primarily through a combination of our
    existing cash balances and operating cash flow. Any remaining
    cash uses could be funded by increasing our borrowings under our
    commercial paper program or with borrowings from the available
    capacity under our credit facilities, which was approximately
    $3.1 billion as of January 31, 2009. The amount of
    operating cash flow to be generated during 2009 is uncertain due
    to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously
    cited. However, we expect our combined capital resources to be
    adequate to fund our capital expenditures and other cash uses
    for 2009.

If significant other acquisitions or other unplanned capital
    requirements arise during the year, we could utilize our
    existing credit facilities

and/or

seek
    to establish and utilize other sources of financing.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The primary objective of the following information is to provide
    forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about
    our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market
    risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse
    changes in oil, gas and NGL prices, interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. The following disclosures are not meant
    to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather
    indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking
    information provides indicators of how we view and manage our
    ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive
    instruments were entered into for purposes other than
    speculative trading.



Commodity
    Price Risk

Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to
    our oil, gas and NGL production. Realized pricing is primarily
    driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
    market prices applicable to our U.S. and Canadian gas and
    NGL production. Pricing for oil, gas and NGL production has been
    volatile and unpredictable for several years. See
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

We periodically enter into financial hedging activities with
    respect to a portion of our oil and gas production through
    various financial transactions that hedge the future prices
    received. These transactions include financial price swaps
    whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay
    a variable market price to the contract counterparty, and
    costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for
    the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices
    are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in
    the various collars, we will settle the difference with the
    counterparty to the collars. These financial hedging activities
    are intended to support oil and gas prices at targeted levels
    and to manage our exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations.

Based on gas contracts in place as of February 16, 2009 we
    have approximately 0.3 Bcf per day of gas production in
    2009 that is associated with price collars or fixed-price
    contracts. This amount represents approximately 10% of our
    estimated 2009 gas production, or 7% of our total Boe
    production. All of the price collar contracts expire
    December 31, 2009. Our fixed-price physical delivery
    contracts extend through 2011. These physical delivery contracts
    relate to our Canadian gas production and range from six Bcf to
    14 Bcf per year. These physical delivery contracts are not
    expected to have a material effect on our realized gas prices
    from 2009 through 2011.

The key terms of our gas price collar contracts are presented in
    the following table.

The fair values of our and gas price collars are largely
    determined by estimates of the forward curves of relevant oil
    and gas price indexes. At December 31, 2008, a 10% increase
    in these forward curves would have decreased the net assets
    recorded for our commodity hedging instruments by approximately
    $54 million.

Interest
    Rate Risk

At December 31, 2008, we had debt outstanding of
    $5.8 billion. Of this amount, $4.8 billion, or 83%,
    bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Additionally, we
    had $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper, bearing
    interest at floating rates which averaged 3.0%.

We also have interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of the
    fair value effects of interest rate fluctuations on our
    fixed-rate debt. Under the terms of these swaps, we receive a
    fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a total notional amount of
    $1.05 billion. The key terms of these interest rate swaps
    are presented in the following table.

The fair values of our interest rate instruments are largely
    determined by estimates of the forward curves of the Federal
    Funds rate and LIBOR. At December 31, 2008, a 10% increase
    in these forward curves would have decreased our net assets by
    approximately $3 million.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
    subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of
    such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional
    currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable
    exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues,
    expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange
    rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in
    the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not
    materially impact our December 31, 2008 balance sheet.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Devon Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income,
    stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. We also
    have audited Devon Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Devon Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for these
    consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report
    contained in “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures”
    of Devon Energy Corporation’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements
    included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, Devon Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on control
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

    statements, as of January 1, 2007, Devon Energy Corporation
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting policies used by Devon Energy Corporation and
    subsidiaries (“Devon”) reflect industry practices and
    conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The more significant of such policies
    are discussed below.

Nature
    of Business and Principles of Consolidation

Devon is engaged primarily in oil and gas exploration,
    development and production, and the acquisition of properties.
    Such activities in the United States are concentrated in the
    following geographic areas:

•

the Mid-Continent area of the central and southern United
    States, principally in north and east Texas and Oklahoma;

•

the Permian Basin within Texas and New Mexico;

•

the Rocky Mountains area of the United States stretching from
    the Canadian border into northern New Mexico;

•

the offshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico; and

•

the onshore areas of the Gulf Coast, principally in south Texas
    and south Louisiana.

Devon’s Canadian operations are located primarily in the
    provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.
    Devon’s international operations — outside of
    North America — are located primarily in Azerbaijan,
    Brazil and China. In 2007, Devon sold its assets and terminated
    its operations in Egypt. During 2008, Devon sold its assets and
    terminated its operations in West Africa. These divestiture
    activities are described more fully in Note 16.

Devon also has marketing and midstream operations that perform
    various activities to support the oil and gas operations of
    Devon as well as unrelated third parties. Such activities
    include marketing gas, crude oil and NGLs, as well as
    constructing and operating pipelines, storage and treating
    facilities and natural gas processing plants.

The accounts of Devon’s controlled subsidiaries are
    included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
    Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could
    differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are
    recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include the following:

•

estimates of proved reserves and related estimates of the
    present value of future net revenues;

•

the carrying value of oil and gas properties;

•

estimates of the fair value of reporting units and related
    assessment of goodwill for impairment;

•

asset retirement obligations;

•

income taxes;

•

derivative financial instruments;

•

obligations related to employee benefits; and

•

legal and environmental risks and exposures.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Devon is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing
    business operations. Devon’s largest areas of risk exposure
    relate to commodity prices, interest rates and Canadian to
    U.S. dollar exchange rates. As discussed more fully below,
    Devon uses derivative instruments primarily to manage commodity
    price risk and interest rate risk. Besides these derivative
    instruments, Devon also had an embedded option derivative
    related to the fair value of its debentures exchangeable into
    shares of Chevron common stock. Devon ceased to have this option
    when the exchangeable debentures matured on August 15, 2008.

Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments
    with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production that
    hedge the future prices received. These instruments are used to
    manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil
    and gas price volatility. Devon’s derivative financial
    instruments include financial price swaps and costless price
    collars. Under the terms of the swaps, Devon will receive a
    fixed price for its production and pay a variable market price
    to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and
    ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable
    monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor
    and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon will
    cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars.

Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its
    exposure to interest rate volatility. Devon uses these swaps to
    mitigate a portion of the fair value effects of interest rate
    fluctuations on its fixed-rate debt. Under the terms of these
    swaps, Devon receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate on a
    total notional amount.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their
    current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the
    balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative
    financial instruments are recorded in the statement of
    operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If
    such criteria are met for cash flow hedges, the effective
    portion of the change in the fair value is recorded directly to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
    stockholders’ equity, until the hedged transaction occurs.
    The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded
    in the statement of operations. If such criteria are met for
    fair value hedges, the change in the fair value is recorded in
    the statement of operations with an offsetting amount recorded
    for the change in fair value of the hedged item. Cash
    settlements with counterparties to Devon’s derivative
    financial instruments are also recorded in the statement of
    operations.

A derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting
    treatment if Devon designates the instrument as such on the date
    the derivative contract is entered into or the date of a
    business combination or other transaction that includes
    derivative contracts. Additionally, Devon must document the
    relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking the instrument. Devon must also assess, both at the
    instrument’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    derivative is highly effective in offsetting the change in cash
    flow of the hedged item. For derivative financial instruments
    held during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008,
    Devon chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify its
    derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
    changes in commodity prices and interest rates, Devon exposes
    itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the
    failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
    derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging
    instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom
    Devon believes are minimal credit risks. It is Devon’s
    policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment
    grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent
    and competitive market makers.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Market risk is the change in the value of a derivative financial
    instrument that results from a change in commodity prices,
    interest rates or other relevant underlyings. The market risks
    associated with commodity price and interest rate contracts are
    managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the
    types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. The oil
    and gas reference prices upon which the commodity instruments
    are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree
    of historical correlation with actual prices received by Devon.
    Devon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
    for speculative trading purposes.

See Note 3 for the amounts included in Devon’s
    accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations
    associated with its derivative financial instruments.

Discontinued
    Operations

In November 2006 and January 2007, Devon announced plans to
    divest its operations in Egypt and West Africa. As a result, all
    amounts related to Devon’s operations in Egypt and West
    Africa are classified as discontinued operations. The captions
    assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held
    for sale in the accompanying balance sheets present the assets
    and liabilities associated with our discontinued operations. See
    Note 16 for more discussion regarding these divestitures.

Property
    and Equipment

Devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
    gas properties. Accordingly, all costs incidental to the
    acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
    properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, dry holes
    and leasehold equipment, are capitalized. Internal costs
    incurred that are directly identified with acquisition,
    exploration and development activities undertaken by Devon for
    its own account, and that are not related to production, general
    corporate overhead or similar activities, are also capitalized.
    Interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved oil and gas
    properties under current evaluation and major development
    projects of oil and gas properties are also capitalized. All
    costs related to production activities, including workover costs
    incurred solely to maintain or increase levels of production
    from an existing completion interval, are charged to expense as
    incurred.

Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of
    oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, may
    not exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling
    limitation is the estimated after-tax future net revenues,
    discounted at 10% per annum, from proved oil, gas and NGL
    reserves plus the cost of properties not subject to
    amortization. Estimated future net revenues exclude future cash
    outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations
    included in the net book value of oil and gas properties. Such
    limitations are imposed separately on a

country-by-country

basis and are tested quarterly. In calculating future net
    revenues, prices and costs used are those as of the end of the
    appropriate quarterly period. These prices are not changed
    except where different prices are fixed and determinable from
    applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts,
    including derivative contracts in place that qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment. None of Devon’s derivative contracts
    held during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008
    qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes,
    over the ceiling is written off as an expense. An expense
    recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent
    period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased
    the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.

Capitalized costs are depleted by an equivalent

unit-of-production

method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic
    feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Depletion is calculated using
    the capitalized costs, including estimated asset retirement
    costs, plus the estimated future expenditures (based on current
    costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves, net of
    estimated salvage values.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the
    depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not
    proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Devon
    assesses its unproved properties for impairment quarterly.
    Significant unproved properties are assessed individually. Costs
    of insignificant unproved properties are transferred into the
    depletion calculation over average holding periods ranging from
    three years for onshore properties to seven years for offshore
    properties.

No gain or loss is recognized upon disposal of oil and gas
    properties unless such disposal significantly alters the
    relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves in a
    particular country.

Depreciation of midstream pipelines are provided on a

unit-of-production

basis. Depreciation and amortization of other property and
    equipment, including corporate and other midstream assets and
    leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to
    39 years.

Devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations
    associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing
    well sites, offshore production platforms, and midstream
    pipelines and processing plants when there is a legal obligation
    associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset
    retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair
    value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an
    increase to the associated property and equipment on the
    consolidated balance sheet. If the fair value of a recorded
    asset retirement obligation changes, a revision is recorded to
    both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement
    cost. The asset retirement cost is depreciated using a
    systematic and rational method similar to that used for the
    associated property and equipment.

Investments

Devon reports its investments and other marketable securities at
    fair value, except for debt securities in which management has
    the ability and intent to hold until maturity. During the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2008, Devon’s
    investments consisted of auction rate securities and Chevron
    Corporation (“Chevron”) common stock, which are
    discussed below.

Auction
    Rate Securities

At December 31, 2007, Devon held $372 million of
    auction rate securities. Such securities are rated
    AAA — the highest rating — by one or more
    rating agencies and are collateralized by student loans that are
    substantially guaranteed by the United States government.
    Although Devon’s auction rate securities generally have
    contractual maturities of more than 20 years, the
    underlying interest rates on such securities are scheduled to
    reset every seven to 28 days. Therefore, these auction rate
    securities were generally priced and subsequently traded as
    short-term investments because of the interest rate reset
    feature. As a result, Devon classified its auction rate
    securities as short-term investments in the accompanying
    December 31, 2007 consolidated balance sheet and in prior
    periods. At December 31, 2008, Devon’s auction rate
    securities totaled $122 million.

Since February 8, 2008, Devon has experienced difficulty
    selling its securities due to the failure of the auction
    mechanism, which provided liquidity to these securities. An
    auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
    securities could not do so. The securities for which auctions
    have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned
    every seven to 28 days until the auction succeeds, the
    issuer calls the securities or the securities mature.

From February 2008, when auctions began failing, to
    December 31, 2008, issuers have redeemed $30 million
    of Devon’s auction rate securities holdings at par.
    However, based on continued auction failures and the current
    market for Devon’s auction rate securities, Devon has
    classified its securities as long-term investments as of
    December 31, 2008. These securities are included in other
    long-term assets in the



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Devon has the ability
    to hold the securities until maturity. At this time, Devon does
    not believe the values of its long-term securities are impaired.

Chevron
    Common Stock

Until October 31, 2008, Devon owned approximately
    14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock. As described
    in Note 6, Devon exchanged these shares on October 31,
    2008 for cash and certain oil and gas property interests owned
    by Chevron. These shares were held in connection with debt
    previously owed by Devon that contained an exchange option.

The shares of Chevron common stock and the exchange option
    embedded in the debt have always been recorded on Devon’s
    balance sheet at fair value. However, pursuant to accounting
    rules prior to January 1, 2007, only the change in fair
    value of the embedded option had historically been included in
    Devon’s results of operations. Conversely, the change in
    fair value of the Chevron common stock had not been included in
    Devon’s results of operations, but instead had been
    recorded directly to stockholders’ equity as part of
    “accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Effective January 1, 2007, Devon adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

. Statement No. 159 allows a company the
    option to value its financial assets and liabilities, on an
    instrument by instrument basis, at fair value, and include the
    change in fair value of such assets and liabilities in its
    results of operations. Devon chose to apply the provisions of
    Statement No. 159 to its shares of Chevron common stock.
    Accordingly, beginning with the first quarter of 2007, the
    change in fair value of the Chevron common stock owned by Devon,
    along with the change in fair value of the related exchange
    option, are both included in Devon’s results of operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the change in fair
    value of other financial instruments caption on Devon’s
    statement of operations includes an unrealized loss of
    $363 million related to the Chevron common stock and an
    unrealized gain of $109 million related to the embedded
    option. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the change in
    fair value of other financial instruments caption on
    Devon’s statement of operations includes an unrealized gain
    of $281 million related to the Chevron common stock and an
    unrealized loss of $248 million related to the embedded
    option. For the year ended December 31, 2006, prior to
    adopting Statement No. 159, an unrealized loss of
    $181 million related to the change in fair value of the
    embedded option were included in the change in fair value of
    other financial instruments caption on Devon’s statement of
    operations.

As of December 31, 2006, $364 million of after-tax
    unrealized gains related to Devon’s investment in the
    Chevron common stock was included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income. This is the amount of unrealized gains
    that, prior to Devon’s adoption of Statement No. 159,
    had not been recorded in Devon’s historical results of
    operations. Upon the adoption of Statement No. 159 as of
    January 1, 2007, this $364 million net unrealized gain
    was reclassified on Devon’s balance sheet from accumulated
    other comprehensive income to retained earnings.

In conjunction with the adoption of Statement No. 159,
    Devon also adopted on January 1, 2007 Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

. Statement No. 157 provides a common
    definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements, but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. The adoption of Statement No. 157 had no
    impact on Devon’s financial statements, but the adoption
    did result in additional required disclosures as set forth in
    Note 11.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business
    combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and
    is tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment test
    requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and
    liabilities to assigned reporting units. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is estimated and compared to the net book value
    of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than the net book value, including
    goodwill, then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair
    value of the goodwill through a charge to expense. Because
    quoted market prices are not available for Devon’s
    reporting units, the fair values of the reporting units are
    estimated based upon several valuation analyses, including
    comparable companies, comparable transactions and premiums paid.
    Devon performed annual impairment tests of goodwill in the
    fourth quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006. Based on these
    assessments, no impairment of goodwill was required.

The table below provides a summary of Devon’s goodwill, by
    assigned reporting unit, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.
    The decrease in goodwill from 2007 to 2008 is largely due to
    changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
    the Canadian dollar.

Foreign
    Currency Translation Adjustments

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for Devon’s
    consolidated operations except its Canadian subsidiaries, which
    use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore,
    the assets and liabilities of Devon’s Canadian subsidiaries
    are translated into U.S. dollars based on the current
    exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Canadian
    income and expenses are translated at average rates for the
    periods presented. Translation adjustments have no effect on net
    income and are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income in stockholders’ equity. The following table
    presents the balances of Devon’s cumulative translation
    adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims,
    assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can
    be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for environmental
    remediation or restoration claims are recorded when it is
    probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can
    be reasonably estimated. Expenditures related to such
    environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance
    with Devon’s accounting policy for property and equipment.
    Reference is made to Note 10 for a discussion of amounts
    recorded for these liabilities.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Revenue
    Recognition and Gas Balancing

Oil, gas and NGL revenues are recognized when production is sold
    to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectability of the
    revenue is probable. Delivery occurs and title is transferred
    when production has been delivered to a pipeline, railcar or
    truck or a tanker lifting has occurred. Cash received relating
    to future production is deferred and recognized when all revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Taxes assessed by governmental
    authorities on oil, gas and NGL revenues are presented
    separately from such revenues as production taxes in the
    statement of operations.

Devon follows the sales method of accounting for gas production
    imbalances. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes
    to which Devon is entitled based on its interests in the
    properties. These differences create imbalances that are
    recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining
    reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced
    owner to recoup its entitled share through production. The
    liability is priced based on current market prices. No
    receivables are recorded for those wells where Devon has taken
    less than its share of production unless all revenue recognition
    criteria are met. If an imbalance exists at the time the
    wells’ reserves are depleted, settlements are made among
    the joint interest owners under a variety of arrangements.

Marketing and midstream revenues are recorded at the time
    products are sold or services are provided to third parties at a
    fixed or determinable price, delivery or performance has
    occurred, title has transferred and collectibility of the
    revenue is probable. Revenues and expenses attributable to gas
    and NGL purchase, transportation and processing contracts are
    reported on a gross basis when Devon takes title to the products
    and has risks and rewards of ownership.

Major
    Purchasers

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, no purchaser accounted for more than
    10% of Devon’s revenues from continuing operations.

General
    and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts
    reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas
    properties operated by Devon and net of amounts capitalized
    pursuant to the full cost method of accounting.

Share
    Based Compensation

Devon grants stock options, restricted stock awards and other
    types of share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors
    and selected employees. All such awards are measured at fair
    value on the date of grant and are recognized as a component of
    general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
    statements of operations over the applicable vesting periods.

Income
    Taxes

Devon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal
    and various state jurisdictions in the United States and by
    other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for
    deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions using the
    asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
    consequences attributable to differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized
    for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected
    utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and
    other types of carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences and



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The
    effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
    rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date.

During 2008, Devon repatriated earnings from certain foreign
    subsidiaries to the United States in conjunction with the
    divestitures of its assets in West Africa. Subsequent to these
    repatriations, Devon does not expect to repatriate similar
    earnings from its historical operations in the foreseeable
    future. As a result, undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries included in continuing operations were determined
    to be permanently reinvested as of December 31, 2008.
    Therefore, no U.S. deferred income taxes were provided on
    such amounts as of December 31, 2008. If it becomes
    apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings will be
    distributed, Devon would then record taxes on those earnings.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.

Interpretation No. 48 prescribes a threshold for
    recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position
    when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits,
    that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing
    authority. Recognized tax positions are initially and
    subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that
    is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement with a taxing authority. Liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits related to such tax positions are included in other
    long-term liabilities unless the tax position is expected to be
    settled within the upcoming year, in which case the liabilities
    are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    included in income tax expense.

On January 1, 2007, Devon adopted Interpretation
    No. 48 and recorded an $11 million reduction to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings related to
    unrecognized tax benefits. The $11 million included
    $8 million for related interest and penalties. An
    additional $3 million of liabilities were recorded with a
    corresponding increase to goodwill.

Additional information regarding Devon’s unrecognized tax
    benefits, including changes in such amounts during 2008 and
    2007, is provided in Note 15.

Net
    (Loss) Earnings Per Common Share

Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing (loss)
    earnings applicable to common stockholders by the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury
    stock method to reflect the potential dilution that could occur
    if Devon’s dilutive outstanding stock options were
    exercised.

Statements
    of Cash Flows

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Devon
    considers all highly liquid investments with original
    contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash
    equivalents.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141(R),

Business
    Combinations

, which replaces Statement No. 141.
    Statement No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements
    of Statement No. 141 that an acquirer be identified and the
    acquisition method of accounting (previously called the purchase
    method) be used for all business combinations. Statement
    No. 141(R)’s scope is broader than that of Statement
    No. 141, which applied only to business combinations in
    which control was obtained by transferring consideration. By
    applying the acquisition method to all transactions and other
    events in which one entity obtains control over one or more
    other businesses, Statement No. 141(R) improves the
    comparability of the information about business combinations
    provided in financial reports. Statement No. 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes and measures identifiable assets

acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in
    the acquiree, as well as any resulting goodwill. Statement
    No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
    the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. Devon will evaluate how the new
    requirements of Statement No. 141(R) would impact any
    business combinations completed in 2009 or thereafter.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

. A
    noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest,
    is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable,
    directly or indirectly, to a parent. Statement No. 160
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Under Statement No. 160,
    noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary must be reported as a
    component of consolidated equity separate from the parent’s
    equity. Additionally, the amounts of consolidated net income
    attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest
    must be reported separately on the face of the income statement.
    Statement No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is
    prohibited. The adoption of Statement No. 160 will not have
    a material impact on Devon’s financial statements and
    related disclosures.

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position
    No. FAS 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

. Staff Position 132(R)-1
    amends FASB Statement No. 132 (revised 2003),

Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
    Postretirement Benefits

, to require additional disclosures
    about the types of assets and associated risks in an
    employer’s defined benefit pension or other postretirement
    plan. Staff Position 132(R)-1 is effective for fiscal years
    ending after December 15, 2009. Devon is evaluating the
    impact the adoption of Staff Position 132(R)-1 will have on its
    financial statement disclosures. However, Devon’s adoption
    of Staff Position 132(R)-1 will not affect its current
    accounting for its pension and postretirement plans.

Modernization
    of Oil and Gas Reporting

In December 2008, the SEC adopted revisions to its required oil
    and gas reporting disclosures. The revisions are intended to
    provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive
    understanding of oil and gas reserves. In the three decades that
    have passed since adoption of these disclosure items, there have
    been significant changes in the oil and gas industry. The
    amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas
    disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and
    changes in technology. In addition, the amendments concurrently
    align the SEC’s full cost accounting rules with the revised
    disclosures. The revised disclosure requirements must be
    incorporated in registration statements filed on or after
    January 1, 2010, and annual reports on

Form 10-K

for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009. A
    company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly
    reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised
    disclosures are required.

The following amendments have the greatest likelihood of
    affecting Devon’s reserve disclosures, including the
    comparability of its reserves disclosures with those of its peer
    companies:

•

Pricing mechanism for oil and gas reserves estimation

— The SEC’s current rules require proved
    reserve estimates to be calculated using prices as of the end of
    the period and held constant over the life of the reserves.
    Price changes can be made only to the extent provided by
    contractual arrangements. The revised rules require reserve
    estimates to be calculated using a

12-month

average price. The

12-month

average price will also be used for purposes of calculating the
    full cost ceiling limitations. Price changes can still be
    incorporated to the extent defined by contractual arrangements.
    The use of a

12-month

average price rather than a

single-day

price is expected to reduce the impact on reserve estimates and
    the full cost ceiling limitations due to short-term volatility
    and seasonality of prices.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

•

Reasonable certainty

— The SEC’s current
    definition of “proved oil and gas reserves”
    incorporate certain specific concepts such as “lowest known
    hydrocarbons,” which limits the ability to claim proved
    reserves in the absence of information on fluid contacts in a
    well penetration, notwithstanding the existence of other
    engineering and geoscientific evidence. The revised rules amend
    the definition to permit the use of new reliable technologies to
    establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves. This
    revision also includes provisions for establishing levels of
    lowest known hydrocarbons and highest known oil through reliable
    technology other than well penetrations.

The revised rules also amend the definition of proved oil and
    gas reserves to include reserves located beyond development
    spacing areas that are immediately adjacent to developed spacing
    areas if economic producibility can be established with
    reasonable certainty. These revisions are designed to permit the
    use of alternative technologies to establish proved reserves in
    lieu of requiring companies to use specific tests. In addition,
    they establish a uniform standard of reasonable certainty that
    applies to all proved reserves, regardless of location or
    distance from producing wells.

Because the revised rules generally expand the definition of
    proved reserves, Devon expects its proved reserve estimates will
    increase upon adoption of the revised rules. However, Devon is
    not able to estimate the magnitude of the potential increase at
    this time.

•

Unproved reserves

— The SEC’s current
    rules prohibit disclosure of reserve estimates other than proved
    in documents filed with the SEC. The revised rules permit
    disclosure of probable and possible reserves and provide
    definitions of probable reserves and possible reserves.
    Disclosure of probable and possible reserves is optional.
    However, such disclosures must meet specific requirements.
    Disclosures of probable or possible reserves must provide the
    same level of geographic detail as proved reserves and must
    state whether the reserves are developed or undeveloped.
    Probable and possible reserve disclosures must also provide the
    relative uncertainty associated with these classifications of
    reserves estimations. Devon has not yet determined whether it
    will disclose its probable and possible reserves in documents
    filed with the SEC.

Chief
    Acquisition

On June 29, 2006, Devon acquired the oil and gas assets of
    privately-owned Chief Holdings LLC (“Chief”). Devon
    paid $2.0 billion in cash and assumed approximately
    $0.2 billion of net liabilities in the

NOTES TO

transaction for a total purchase price of $2.2 billion.
    Devon funded the acquisition price, and the immediate retirement
    of $180 million of assumed debt, with $718 million of
    cash on hand and approximately $1.4 billion of borrowings
    issued under its commercial paper program. The acquired oil and
    gas properties consisted of 99.7 MMBoe (unaudited) of
    proved reserves and leasehold totaling 169,000 net acres
    located in the Barnett Shale area of north Texas. Devon
    allocated approximately $1.0 billion of the purchase price
    to proved reserves and approximately $1.2 billion to
    unproved properties.

During 2008 and 2007, Devon recognized revisions to its asset
    retirement obligations totaling $244 million and
    $311 million, respectively. The primary factors causing the
    2008 fair value increase were an overall increase in abandonment
    cost estimates and a decrease in the discount rate used to
    present value the obligations. In addition, higher abandonment
    cost estimates related to certain offshore platforms that were
    destroyed by Hurricane Ike resulted in an $82 million
    increase in 2008. See additional discussion regarding this
    revision in Note 10 — Hurricane Contingencies.
    The primary factors causing the 2007 fair value increase were an
    overall increase in abandonment cost estimates and an increase
    in the assumed inflation rate. The effect of these factors was
    partially offset by the effect of an increase in the discount
    rate used to calculate the present value of the obligations.

Investment
    in Chevron Corporation Common Stock

Until October 31, 2008, Devon owned 14.2 million
    shares of Chevron common stock. These shares were held in
    connection with debt owed by Devon that contained an exchange
    option. The exchange option allowed the debt holders, prior to
    the debt’s maturity of August 15, 2008, to exchange
    the debt for shares of Chevron common stock owned by Devon.
    However, Devon had the option to settle any exchanges with cash
    equal to the market value of Chevron common stock at the time of
    the exchange. Devon settled exchange requests during 2008 and
    2007 by paying $1.0 billion during 2008 and
    $0.2 billion during 2007.

On October 31, 2008, Devon transferred its
    14.2 million shares of Chevron common stock to Chevron. In
    exchange, Devon received Chevron’s interest in the
    Drunkard’s Wash coalbed natural gas field in east-central
    Utah and $280 million in cash. The field has approximately
    51,000 net acres and had net production of about
    40 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day
    (unaudited) at the time of the exchange.

Credit
    Lines

Devon has two revolving lines of credit that can be accessed to
    provide liquidity as needed. As of December 31, 2008,
    Devon’s combined available capacity under these credit
    facilities, net of $119 million of outstanding letters of
    credit and $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper,
    was $2.2 billion.

Devon has a $2.65 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving
    line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The
    maturity date for $2.15 billion of the Senior Credit
    Facility is April 7, 2013. The maturity date for the
    remaining $0.5 billion is April 7, 2012. All amounts
    outstanding will be due and payable on the respective maturity
    dates unless the maturity is extended. Prior to each April 7
    anniversary date, Devon has the option to



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

extend the maturity of the Senior Credit Facility for one year,
    subject to the approval of the lenders. The Senior Credit
    Facility includes a revolving Canadian subfacility in a maximum
    amount of U.S. $500 million.

Amounts borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility may, at the
    election of Devon, bear interest at various fixed rate options
    for periods of up to twelve months. Such rates are generally
    less than the prime rate. However, Devon may elect to borrow at
    the prime rate. The Senior Credit Facility currently provides
    for an annual facility fee of $1.9 million that is payable
    quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2008, there were
    no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.

On November 5, 2008, Devon established a new
    $700 million

364-day,

syndicated, unsecured revolving senior credit facility (the
    “Short-Term Facility”). The Short-Term Facility
    provides Devon with incremental liquidity for near-term capital
    expenditures.

The Short-Term Facility matures on November 3, 2009. On the
    maturity date, all amounts outstanding will be due and payable
    at that time. Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Facility
    bear interest at various fixed rate options for periods of up to
    12 months. Such rates are generally based on LIBOR or the
    prime rate. The Short-Term Facility currently provides for an
    annual facility fee of approximately $0.7 million that is
    payable quarterly in arrears. As of December 31, 2008,
    there were no borrowings under the Short-Term Facility.

The Senior Credit Facility and Short-Term Facility contain only
    one material financial covenant. This covenant requires
    Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization
    to be less than 65%. The credit agreement contains definitions
    of total funded debt and total capitalization that include
    adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the
    consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is
    adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full
    cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of
    December 31, 2008, Devon was in compliance with this
    covenant. Devon’s

debt-to-capitalization

ratio at December 31, 2008, as calculated pursuant to the
    terms of the agreement, was 18.6%.

Commercial
    Paper

Devon also has access to short-term credit under its commercial
    paper program. Total borrowings under the commercial paper
    program may not exceed $2.85 billion. Also, any borrowings
    under the commercial paper program reduce available capacity
    under the Senior Credit Facility or the Short-Term Facility on a

dollar-for-dollar

basis. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between
    one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to
    365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time
    of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index
    such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate
    as found on the commercial paper market. As of December 31,
    2008, Devon had $1.0 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at an average rate of 3.00%. The average borrowing
    rate for Devon’s $1.0 billion of commercial paper debt
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 was 5.07%.

In January 2009, Devon issued $500 million of
    5.625% senior notes due January 15, 2014 and
    $700 million of 6.30% senior notes due
    January 15, 2019. The net proceeds from issuance of this
    debt were used primarily to repay Devon’s outstanding
    commercial paper as of December 31, 2008. Therefore, the
    $1.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper is classified
    as long-term debt in the accompanying 2008 consolidated balance
    sheet. Outstanding commercial paper is classified as short-term
    debt in the accompanying 2007 consolidated balance sheet.

    wholly-owned finance subsidiary, sold these notes and
    debentures, which are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations
    of Devon Financing. Devon has fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis the
    obligations of Devon Financing under the debt securities. The
    proceeds from the issuance of these debt securities were used to
    fund a portion of the acquisition of Anderson Exploration.

7.95% Notes

Retirement
    Plans

Devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans, including qualified plans (“Qualified Plans”)
    and nonqualified plans (“Supplemental Plans”). The
    Qualified Plans provide retirement benefits for



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

U.S. and Canadian employees meeting certain age and service
    requirements. Benefits for the Qualified Plans are based on the
    employees’ years of service and compensation and are funded
    from assets held in the plans’ trusts.

Devon’s funding policy regarding the Qualified Plans is to
    contribute the amount of funds necessary for the Qualified
    Plans’ assets to approximately equal the present value of
    benefits earned by the participants, as calculated in accordance
    with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair values of the
    Qualified Plans’ assets were $430 million and
    $619 million, respectively. The assets were
    $209 million less and $62 million more, respectively,
    than the related accumulated benefit obligation. The amount of
    contributions required during future periods will depend on
    investment returns from the plan assets during the same period
    as well as changes in long-term interest rates.

The Supplemental Plans provide retirement benefits for certain
    employees whose benefits under the Qualified Plans are limited
    by income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans’ benefits
    are based on the employees’ years of service and
    compensation. For certain Supplemental Plans, Devon has
    established trusts to fund these plans’ benefit
    obligations. The total value of these trusts was
    $50 million and $59 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, and is included in noncurrent other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheets. For the remaining
    Supplemental Plans for which trusts have not been established,
    benefits are funded from Devon’s available cash and cash
    equivalents.

Devon also has defined benefit postretirement plans
    (“Postretirement Plans”) that provide benefits for
    substantially all U.S. employees. The Postretirement Plans
    provide medical and, in some cases, life insurance benefits and
    are, depending on the type of plan, either contributory or
    non-contributory. Benefit obligations for the Postretirement
    Plans are estimated based on Devon’s future cost-sharing
    intentions. Devon’s funding policy for the Postretirement
    Plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with
    available cash and cash equivalents.

Revisions
    to Retirement Plans

In the second quarter of 2007, Devon adopted an enhanced defined
    contribution structure related to its 401(k) Incentive Savings
    Plan (“401(k) Plan”) to be effective January 1,
    2008. Participants in this enhanced defined contribution
    structure continue to receive a discretionary match of a
    percentage of their contributions to the 401(k) Plan. These
    participants also receive additional, nondiscretionary
    contributions by Devon calculated as a percentage of annual
    compensation. The percentage varies based on the employees’
    years of service.

On or before November 15, 2007, existing eligible employees
    elected to either continue to participate in the defined benefit
    plan or participate in the enhanced defined contribution
    structure of the 401(k) Plan. Employees who elected to continue
    participating in the defined benefit plans continue to accrue
    benefits under the existing provisions of such plans. Employees
    who elected to participate in the enhanced defined contribution
    structure receive enhanced contributions to the 401(k) Plan and
    retain the benefits that they had accrued under the defined
    benefit plan as of December 31, 2007. However, such
    employees are only entitled to the benefits that have accrued in
    the defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2007, after
    all applicable vesting requirements have been met. Employees
    hired on or after October 1, 2007 do not have an election
    and only participate in the 401(k) Plan and the enhanced defined
    contribution structure.

For those employees who elected to participate in the enhanced
    defined contribution structure, Devon’s pension benefit
    obligation included $16 million related to projected future
    years of service for these employees. Because this portion of
    the employees’ benefits was curtailed upon their election,
    Devon reduced its pension liabilities by $16 million in the
    fourth quarter of 2007.

Change
    in Measurement Date

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R)

. Statement No. 158 requires the
    measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the
    date of the employer’s fiscal year-end, beginning with
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Although not
    required until 2008, Devon adopted this measurement-date
    requirement in the second quarter of 2007 and changed its
    measurement date from November 30 to December 31. As a
    result, Devon used data as of December 31, 2006 to
    remeasure its plans assets and benefit obligations previously
    measured using data as of November 30, 2006. As a result of
    the remeasurement, Devon recognized the following amounts in the
    second quarter of 2007.

Benefit
    Obligations and Plan Assets

The following table presents the status of Devon’s pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans for 2008 and 2007. The
    benefit obligation for pension plans represents the projected
    benefit obligation, while the benefit obligation for the
    postretirement benefit plans represents the accumulated benefit
    obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the
    projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no
    assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated
    benefit obligation for pension plans at December 31, 2008
    and 2007 was $795 million and $693 million,
    respectively.

Discount rate

— Future pension and
    postretirement obligations are discounted at the end of each
    year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively
    settled, considering the timing of estimated future cash flows
    related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond
    yields, after allowing for call and default risk. High quality
    corporate bond yield indices, such as Moody’s Aa, are
    considered when selecting the discount rate.

Rate of compensation increase

— For measurement
    of the 2008 and 2007 benefit obligations for the pension plans,
    the 7% compensation increase in the table above represents the
    assumed increase through 2011. The rate was assumed to decrease
    to 5% in the year 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. For
    measurement of the 2006 benefit obligation for the pension
    plans, the 7% compensation increase in the table above
    represents the assumed increase for 2007 and 2008. The rate was
    assumed to decrease one percent annually to 5% in the year 2010
    and remain at that level thereafter.

Expected return on plan assets

— Devon’s
    overall investment objective for its retirement plans’
    assets is to achieve long-term growth of invested capital to
    ensure payments of retirement benefits obligations can be funded
    when required. To assist in achieving this objective, Devon has
    established certain investment strategies, including target
    allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments,
    designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. At
    December 31, 2008, the target investment allocation for
    Devon’s plan assets was 30% U.S. large cap equity
    securities; 15% U.S. small cap equity securities, equally
    allocated between growth and value; 15% international equity
    securities, equally allocated between growth and value; and 40%
    debt securities. Derivatives or other speculative investments
    considered high-risk are generally prohibited.

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by
    evaluating input from external consultants and economists as
    well as long-term inflation assumptions. Devon expects the
    long-term asset allocation to approximate the targeted
    allocation. Therefore, the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets is based on the target allocation of investment
    types in such assets.

Other assumptions

— For measurement of the 2008
    benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans,
    an 8.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
    covered health care benefits was assumed for 2009. The rate was
    assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of 5% in the
    year 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health
    care cost-trend rates affect the amounts reported for retiree
    health care costs. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
    health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on
    the December 31, 2008 other postretirement benefits
    obligation and the 2009 service and interest cost components of
    net periodic benefit cost.

Other
    Benefit Plans

Devon’s 401(k) Plan covers all domestic employees. At its
    discretion, Devon may match a certain percentage of the
    employees’ contributions to the plan. The matching
    percentage is determined annually by the Board of Directors.

As previously discussed in “Revisions to Retirement
    Plans” above, in 2007 Devon adopted an enhanced defined
    contribution structure related to its 401(k) Plan effective
    January 1, 2008. Participants who elected to participate in
    this enhanced defined contribution structure, as well as all
    employees hired on or after October 1, 2007, continue to
    receive a discretionary match of a percentage of their
    contributions to the 401(k) Plan. These participants also
    receive additional, nondiscretionary contributions by Devon
    calculated as a percentage of annual compensation. The
    percentage will vary based on the employees’ years of
    service.

Devon has defined contribution pension plans for its Canadian
    employees. Devon makes a contribution to each employee that is
    based upon the employee’s base compensation and
    classification. Such contributions are subject to maximum
    amounts allowed under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Devon also
    has a savings plan for its Canadian employees. Under the savings
    plan, Devon contributes a base percentage amount to all
    employees and the employee may elect to contribute an additional
    percentage amount (up to a maximum amount) which is matched by
    additional Devon contributions.

The following table presents Devon’s expense related to
    these defined contribution plans during 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Stockholders’
    Equity

The authorized capital stock of Devon consists of 1 billion
    shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, and
    4.5 million shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per
    share. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series,
    and the terms and rights of such stock will be determined by the
    Board of Directors.

Devon’s Board of Directors has designated 2.9 million
    shares of the preferred stock as Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series A Junior
    Preferred Stock”) in connection with the adoption of the
    shareholder rights plan described later in this note. At
    December 31, 2008, there were no shares of Series A
    Junior Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. The Series A
    Junior Preferred Stock is entitled to receive cumulative
    quarterly dividends per share equal to the greater of $1.00 or
    200 times the aggregate per share amount of all dividends (other
    than stock dividends) declared on common stock since the
    immediately preceding quarterly dividend payment date or, with
    respect to the first payment date, since the first issuance of
    Series A Junior Preferred Stock. Holders of the
    Series A Junior Preferred Stock are entitled to 200 votes
    per share (subject to adjustment to prevent dilution) on all
    matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The
    Series A Junior Preferred Stock is neither redeemable nor
    convertible. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock ranks
    prior to the common stock but junior to all other classes of
    Preferred Stock.

Preferred
    Stock Redemption

On June 20, 2008, Devon redeemed all 1.5 million
    outstanding shares of its 6.49% Series A cumulative
    preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock was redeemed for
    cash at a redemption price of $100 per share, plus accrued and
    unpaid dividends up to the redemption date.

Stock
    Repurchases

Devon’s Board of Directors has approved an ongoing, annual
    stock repurchase program to minimize dilution resulting from
    restricted stock issued to, and options exercised by, employees.
    Also, Devon’s Board of Directors approved a program in 2007
    to repurchase up to 50 million shares. This program expires
    on December 31, 2009 and was created as a potential use of
    the proceeds received from Devon’s West African property
    divestitures. Devon’s Board of Directors also approved a
    separate 50 million share repurchase program in August
    2005, which expired on December 31, 2007.

In response to the current economic environment and recent
    downturn in commodity prices, Devon has indefinitely suspended
    activity under its authorized programs. As a result, Devon does
    not anticipate repurchasing shares under these programs in the
    foreseeable future. Should economic conditions or commodity
    prices strengthen, Devon will consider resumption of share
    repurchases under its authorized programs.

During the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, Devon
    repurchased 14.8 million shares at a total cost of
    $1.2 billion, or $83.98 per share, under these repurchase
    programs. The following table summarizes Devon’s
    repurchases under these plans during 2008, 2007 and 2006

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

Under Devon’s shareholder rights plan, stockholders have
    one-half of one right for each share of common stock held. The
    rights become exercisable and separately transferable ten
    business days after (a) an announcement that a person has
    acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
    voting shares outstanding, or (b) commencement of a tender
    or exchange offer that could result in a person owning 15% or
    more of the voting shares outstanding.

Each right entitles its holder (except a holder who is the
    acquiring person) to purchase either (a) 1/100 of a share
    of Series A Preferred Stock for $185.00, subject to
    adjustment or, (b) Devon common stock with a value equal to
    twice the exercise price of the right, subject to adjustment to
    prevent dilution. In the event of certain merger or asset sale
    transactions with another party or transactions that would
    increase the equity ownership of a shareholder who then owned
    15% or more of Devon, each Devon right will entitle its holder
    to purchase securities of the merging or acquiring party with a
    value equal to twice the exercise price of the right.

The rights, which have no voting power, expire on
    August 17, 2009. The rights may be redeemed by Devon for
    $0.01 per right until the rights become exercisable.

Dividends

Devon paid common stock dividends of $284 million (or $0.64

    $199 million (or $0.45 per share) in 2008, 2007 and 2006
    respectively. Devon paid dividends of $5 million in 2008
    and $10 million in both 2007 and 2006 to preferred
    stockholders. The decrease in preferred stock dividend in 2008
    is due to the redemption of the preferred stock in the second
    quarter of 2008.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal
    course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
    outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are
    accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the
    matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters
    and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
    similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management
    to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s
    financial position or results of operations after consideration
    of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ
    materially from management’s estimate.

Environmental
    Matters

Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to
    environmental remediation activities associated with past
    operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
    state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these
    activities, accruals have been established when reasonable
    estimates are possible. Such accruals primarily include
    estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon has not used
    discounting in determining its accrued liabilities for
    environmental remediation, and no material claims for possible
    recovery from third-party insurers or other parties related to
    environmental costs have been recognized in Devon’s
    consolidated financial statements. Devon adjusts the accruals
    when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and
    probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation
    estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.

Certain of Devon’s subsidiaries acquired in past mergers
    are involved in matters in which it has been alleged that such
    subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties
    (“PRPs”) under CERCLA or similar state legislation
    with respect to various waste disposal areas owned or operated
    by third parties. As of December 31, 2008, Devon’s
    balance sheet included $1 million of noncurrent accrued
    liabilities, reflected in other liabilities, related to these
    and other environmental remediation liabilities. Devon does not
    currently believe there is a reasonable possibility of incurring
    additional material costs in excess of the current accruals
    recognized for such environmental remediation activities. With
    respect to the sites in which Devon subsidiaries are PRPs,
    Devon’s conclusion is based in large part on
    (i) Devon’s participation in consent decrees with both
    other PRPs and the Environmental Protection Agency, which
    provide for performing the scope of work required for
    remediation and contain covenants not to sue as protection to
    the PRPs, (ii) participation in groups as a

de minimis

PRP

,

and (iii) the availability of other
    defenses to liability. As a result, Devon’s monetary
    exposure is not expected to be material.

Royalty
    Matters

Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including
    Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of
    the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the
    producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper
    deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions
    with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in
    connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from
    federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. The principal suit
    in which Devon is a defendant is

United States ex rel.
    Wright v. Chevron USA, Inc. et al.

(the “Wright
    case”). The suit was originally filed in August 1996 in the
    United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
    but was consolidated in October 2000 with other suits for
    pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for
    the District of



DEVON

    (Continued)

Wyoming. On July 10, 2003, the District of Wyoming remanded
    the Wright case back to the Eastern District of Texas to resume
    proceedings. On April 12, 2007, the court entered a trial
    plan and scheduling order in which the case will proceed in
    phases. Two phases have been scheduled to date. The first phase
    was scheduled to begin in August 2008, but the defendant settled
    prior to trial. The second phase was scheduled to begin in
    February 2009, but the defendants settled prior to trial. Devon
    was not included in the groups of defendants selected for these
    first two phases. Devon believes that it has acted reasonably,
    has legitimate and strong defenses to all allegations in the
    suit, and has paid royalties in good faith. Devon does not
    currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with
    respect to this lawsuit and, therefore, no liability related to
    this lawsuit has been recorded.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Deep Water
    Royalty Relief Act. The intent of this legislation was to
    encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico by
    providing relief from the obligation to pay royalties on certain
    federal leases. Deep water leases issued in certain years by the
    Minerals Management Service (the “MMS”) have contained
    price thresholds, such that if the market prices for oil or gas
    exceeded the thresholds for a given year, royalty relief would
    not be granted for that year. Deep water leases issued in 1998
    and 1999 did not include price thresholds.

The U.S. House of Representatives in January 2007 passed
    legislation that would have required companies to renegotiate
    the 1998 and 1999 leases as a condition of securing future
    federal leases. This legislation was not passed by the
    U.S. Senate. However, Congress may consider similar
    legislation in the future. In October 2007 a federal district
    court ruled in favor of a plaintiff who had challenged the
    legality of including price thresholds in deep water leases.
    Additionally, in January 2009 a federal appellate court upheld
    this district court ruling. This judgment is subject to further
    appeals.

As of December 31, 2008, Devon had $83 million accrued
    for potential royalties on various deep water leases. Due to the
    uncertainty of this issue caused by the favorable federal court
    decisions and potential Congressional actions, Devon has ceased
    accruing additional royalties on its affected leases. Devon will
    continue to monitor developments and adjust its accruals as
    necessary.

Hurricane
    Contingencies

Prior to September 1, 2006, Devon maintained a
    comprehensive insurance program that included coverage for
    physical damage to its offshore facilities caused by hurricanes.
    This program also included substantial business interruption
    coverage, which entitled Devon to be reimbursed for the portion
    of production suspended longer than forty-five days, subject to
    upper limits to oil and gas prices. Also, the terms of the
    historical insurance included a standard, per-event deductible
    of $1 million for offshore losses as well as a
    $15 million aggregate annual deductible.

Devon suffered insured damages in the third quarter of 2005
    related to hurricanes that struck the Gulf of Mexico. During
    2006 and 2007, Devon received $480 million as a full
    settlement of the amount due from its primary insurers and
    certain of its secondary insurers. During the fourth quarter of
    2008, Devon received $106 million as full settlement of the
    amount due from its remaining secondary insurers. Devon’s
    claims under its then existing insurance arrangements included
    both physical damages and business interruption claims. As of
    December 31, 2008, Devon had used $424 million of
    these proceeds as reimbursement of repair costs and deductible
    amounts, resulting in excess recoveries. The $162 million
    of excess recoveries was recorded as other income in the
    accompanying statement of operations during 2008.

The policy underlying the insurance program terms described
    above expired on August 31, 2006. Due to significant
    changes in the insurance marketplace, Devon no longer has
    coverage for damage that may be caused by named windstorms from
    the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, Devon’s current insurance
    program includes coverage for physical damage and business
    interruption but does not have such coverage for damages or
    business interruption caused from named windstorms.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

During the third quarter of 2008, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav
    damaged certain of Devon’s oil and gas facilities and
    transportation systems in the Gulf of Mexico. These damages
    relate to both production operations that will be repaired and
    restored and production operations that will not be restored.
    These damages are uninsured losses because they resulted from
    named windstorms.

For the damaged facilities and transportation systems for which
    Devon intends to resume operations after repairs have been made,
    a loss of $31 million was recognized in 2008. This loss is
    included in lease operating expenses in the accompanying
    statement of operations.

The facilities for which Devon will not restore production
    operations consist of certain platforms that were completely
    destroyed. Devon has begun performing asset retirement
    activities associated with the destroyed platforms and related
    wells. The time and effort required to complete such activities
    is expected to be significant due to the hazardous conditions
    created by the hurricanes. As a result, the estimated costs to
    complete the asset retirement activities are $82 million
    higher than Devon’s previously estimated asset retirement
    obligations related to the destroyed platforms and related
    wells. Therefore, in 2008, Devon increased its asset retirement
    obligations by $82 million with a corresponding increase to
    oil and gas property and equipment in the accompanying balance
    sheet. Based on the projected timing of the retirement
    activities, half of this asset retirement obligation increase
    was recorded to the current portion and half was recorded to the
    long-term portion.

Other
    Matters

Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings
    incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge
    as of the date of this report, there were no other material
    pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which
    any of its property is subject.

Commitments

Devon has certain drilling and facility obligations under
    contractual agreements with third-party service providers to
    procure drilling rigs and other related services for
    developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities
    construction. Included in the $3.7 billion total of
    “Drilling and Facility Obligations” in the table below
    is $1.7 billion that relates to long-term contracts for
    three deepwater drilling rigs and certain other contracts for
    onshore drilling and facility obligations in which drilling or
    facilities construction has not commenced. The $1.7 billion
    represents the gross commitment under these contracts.
    Devon’s ultimate payment for these commitments will be
    reduced by the amounts billed to its partners when net working
    interests are ultimately determined. Payments for these
    commitments, net of amounts billed to partners, will be
    capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties.

Devon has certain firm transportation agreements that represent
    “ship or pay” arrangements whereby Devon has committed
    to ship certain volumes of oil, gas and NGLs for a fixed
    transportation fee. Devon has entered into these agreements to
    aid the movement of its production to market. Devon expects to
    have sufficient production to utilize the majority of these
    transportation services.

Devon leases certain office space and equipment under operating
    lease arrangements. Total rental expense included in general and
    administrative expenses under operating leases, net of

sub-lease

income, was $46 million, $43 million and
    $36 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Devon assumed two offshore platform spar leases through the 2003
    Ocean merger. The spars are being used in the development of the
    Nansen and Boomvang fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The Boomvang
    field was divested as part of the 2005 property divestiture
    program. The Nansen operating lease is for a

20-year

term
    and contains various options whereby Devon may purchase the
    lessors’ interests in the spar. Total rental expense
    included in lease operating expenses under the Nansen operating
    lease was $12 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Devon has guaranteed that the Nansen spar will have a residual
    value at the end of the



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

operating lease equal to at least 10% of the fair value of the
    spar at the inception of the lease. The total guaranteed value
    is $14 million in 2022. However, such amount may be reduced
    under the terms of the lease agreement. As a result of the sale
    of the Boomvang field, Devon is subleasing the Boomvang Spar. If
    the sublessee were to default on its obligation, Devon would
    continue to be obligated to pay the periodic lease payments and
    any guaranteed value required at the end of the term.

Devon has a floating, production, storage and offloading
    facility (“FPSO”) that is being used in the Panyu
    project offshore China and is being leased under operating lease
    arrangements. This lease expires in September 2009. Devon is
    also leasing an FPSO that is being used in the Polvo project
    offshore Brazil. This lease expires in 2014. Devon expects to
    begin production from its Cascade development in the Gulf of
    Mexico in 2010. As a result, Devon has entered into a contract
    to lease an FPSO. This lease expires in 2015. Total rental
    expense included in lease operating expenses under the China and
    Brazil operating leases was $25 million, $17 million
    and $9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum payments
    for drilling and facility obligations, firm transportation
    agreements and leases that have initial or remaining
    noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
    December 31, 2008. The schedule includes $42 million
    of drilling and facility obligations related to Devon’s
    discontinued operations (see Note 16).

The fair values are classified according to a hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value. As presented in the table above, this hierarchy
    consists of three broad levels. Level 1 inputs on the
    hierarchy consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest
    priority. Level 3 inputs have the lowest priority. Devon
    uses appropriate valuation techniques based on the available
    inputs to measure the fair values of its assets and liabilities.
    When available, Devon measures fair value using Level 1
    inputs because they generally provide the most reliable evidence
    of fair value. The following methods and assumptions were used
    to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities in the
    table above.

Level 1
    Fair Value Measurements

Investment in Chevron Corporation common
    stock

— The fair value of this investment is based
    on a quoted market price.

Debt

— The fair value of Devon’s
    variable-rate commercial paper borrowings is the carrying value.
    Certain of Devon’s fixed-rate debt instruments actively
    trade in an established market. The fair values of this debt are
    based on quotes obtained from brokers.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Level 2
    Fair Value Measurements

Gas price swaps and collars

— The fair values
    of the gas price swaps and collars are estimated using internal
    discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward commodity
    price curves, quotes obtained from brokers for contracts with
    similar terms or quotes obtained from counterparties to the
    agreements.

Embedded option in exchangeable debentures

—
    The embedded option was not actively traded in an established
    market. Therefore, its fair value was estimated using quotes
    obtained from a broker for trades near the fair value
    measurement date.

Debt

— Certain of Devon’s fixed-rate debt
    instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The
    fair values of this debt are estimated by discounting the
    principal and interest payments at rates available for debt with
    similar terms and maturity.

Interest rate swaps

— The fair values of the
    interest rate swaps are estimated using internal discounted cash
    flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves
    or quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements.

Level 3
    Fair Value Measurements

Asset retirement obligations

— The fair values
    of the asset retirement obligations are estimated using internal
    discounted cash flow calculations based upon Devon’s
    estimates of future retirement costs. Reconciliations of the
    beginning and ending balances of Devon’s asset retirement
    obligations, including revisions of the estimated fair values in
    2008 and 2007, are presented in Note 5.

Short-term and long-term investments

—
    Devon’s short-term and long-term investments presented in
    the tables above as of December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007 consisted entirely of auction rate
    securities. As of December 31, 2007, Devon estimated the
    fair values of its short-term investments using quoted market
    prices. However, due to the auction failures discussed in
    Note 1 and the lack of an active market for Devon’s
    auction rate securities, quoted market prices for these
    securities were not available as of December 31, 2008.
    Therefore, Devon used valuation techniques that rely on
    unobservable, or Level 3, inputs to estimate the fair
    values of its long-term auction rate securities as of
    December 31, 2008. These inputs were based on the AAA
    credit rating of the securities, the probability of full
    repayment of the securities considering the United States
    government guarantees of substantially all of the underlying
    student loans, the collection of all accrued interest to date
    and continued receipts of principal at par. Devon also has the
    ability to hold these securities until their scheduled maturity
    dates. As a result of using these inputs, Devon concluded the
    estimated fair values of its long-term auction rate securities
    approximated the par values as of December 31, 2008. At
    this time, Devon does not believe the values of its long-term
    securities are impaired.

Included below is a summary of the changes in Devon’s
    Level 3 short-term and long-term investments during 2008
    (in millions).

Share-Based
    Compensation

On June 8, 2005, Devon’s stockholders adopted the 2005
    Long-Term Incentive Plan, which expires on June 8, 2013.
    Devon’s stockholders adopted certain amendments to this
    plan on June 7, 2006. This plan, as amended, authorizes the
    Compensation Committee, which consists of non-management members
    of Devon’s Board of Directors, to grant nonqualified and
    incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, Canadian



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

restricted stock units, performance units, performance bonuses,
    stock appreciation rights and cash-out rights to eligible
    employees. The plan also authorizes the grant of nonqualified
    stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation
    rights to directors. A total of 32 million shares of Devon
    common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the
    plan. To calculate shares issued under the plan, options granted
    represent one share and other awards represent 2.2 shares.

Devon also has stock option plans that were adopted in 2003 and
    1997 under which stock options and restricted stock awards were
    issued to key management and professional employees. Options
    granted under these plans remain exercisable by the employees
    owning such options, but no new options or restricted stock
    awards will be granted under these plans. Devon also has stock
    options outstanding that were assumed as part of the
    acquisitions of Ocean, Mitchell Energy & Development
    Corp., Santa Fe Snyder and PennzEnergy.

With the approval of Devon’s Compensation Committee, Devon
    modified the share-based compensation arrangements for certain
    of Devon’s executives in the second quarter of 2008. The
    modified compensation arrangements provide that executives who
    meet certain

years-of-service

and age criteria can retire and continue vesting in outstanding
    share-based grants. As a condition to receiving the benefits of
    these modifications, the executives must agree not to use or
    disclose Devon’s confidential information and not to
    solicit Devon’s employees and customers. The executives are
    required to agree to these conditions at retirement and again in
    each subsequent year until all grants have vested.

Although this modification does not accelerate the vesting of
    the executives’ grants, it does accelerate the expense
    recognition as executives approach the

years-of-service

and age criteria. When the modification was made in the second
    quarter of 2008, certain executives had already met the

years-of-service

and age criteria. As a result, Devon recognized an additional
    $27 million of share-based compensation expense in the
    second quarter of 2008 related to this modification. This
    additional expense would have been recognized in future
    reporting periods if the modification had not been made and the
    executives continued their employment at Devon.

The following table presents the effects of share-based
    compensation included in Devon’s accompanying statement of
    operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006.

Stock
    Options

Under Devon’s 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options granted may not be less than the
    estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
    In addition, options granted are exercisable during a period
    established for each grant, which may not exceed eight years
    from the date of grant. The recipient must pay the exercise
    price in cash or in common stock, or a combination thereof, at
    the time that the option is exercised. Options granted generally
    have a vesting period that ranges from three to four years.

The fair value of stock options on the date of grant is expensed
    over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the fair
    values of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model, which requires Devon to make several
    assumptions. The volatility of Devon’s common stock is
    based on the historical volatility of the market price of
    Devon’s common stock over a period of time equal to the
    expected term of the option and ending on the grant date. The
    dividend yield is based on Devon’s historical and current
    yield in effect at the date of grant. The risk-free interest
    rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield



DEVON

for the expected term of the option at the date of grant. The
    expected term of the options is based on historical exercise and
    termination experience for various groups of employees and
    directors. Each group is determined based on the similarity of
    their historical exercise and termination behavior.

The following table presents a summary of the grant-date fair
    values of stock options granted and the related assumptions for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. All such

    stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions,
    restrictions and limitations, if any, that the Compensation
    Committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued
    employment. Generally, restricted stock awards and units vest
    over a minimum restriction period of at least three years from
    the date of grant. During the vesting period, recipients of
    restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject
    to restrictions or other limitations. The fair value of
    restricted stock awards and units on the date of grant is
    expensed over the applicable vesting period. Devon estimates the
    fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing
    price of Devon’s common stock on the grant date of the
    award or unit.

Reduction
    of Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

During 2008 and 2006, Devon reduced the carrying values of
    certain of its oil and gas properties due to full cost ceiling
    limitations and unsuccessful exploratory activities. A summary
    of these reductions and additional discussion is provided below.

    Reductions

The 2008 reductions were all recognized in the fourth quarter of
    2008 and resulted primarily from a significant decrease in each
    country’s full cost ceiling. The lower ceiling values
    largely resulted from the effects of sharp declines in oil, gas
    and NGL prices compared to previous quarter-end prices. To
    demonstrate this decline, the December 31, 2008 and
    September 30, 2008 weighted average wellhead prices for the
    United States, Canada and Brazil are presented in the following
    table.

    for crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $5.71 per MMBtu
    for gas. The September 30, 2008, wellhead prices in the
    table compare to the NYMEX cash price of $100.64 per Bbl for
    crude oil and the Henry Hub spot price of $7.12 per MMBtu for
    gas.

    Reductions

As a result of a decline in the estimated future net revenues,
    the carrying value of Devon’s Russian oil and gas
    properties exceeded the full cost ceiling by $10 million at
    the end of the third quarter of 2006. Therefore, Devon
    recognized a $20 million reduction of the carrying value of
    its oil and gas properties in Russia, offset by a
    $10 million deferred income tax benefit.

During the second quarter of 2006, Devon drilled two
    unsuccessful exploratory wells in Brazil and determined that the
    capitalized costs related to these two wells should be impaired.
    Therefore, in the second quarter of 2006, Devon recognized a
    $16 million impairment of its investment in Brazil equal to
    the costs to drill the two dry holes and a proportionate share
    of block-related costs. There was no tax benefit related to this
    impairment. The two wells were unrelated to Devon’s Polvo
    development project in Brazil.

DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, deferred income taxes were reduced
    $7 million, $261 million and $243 million,
    respectively, due to successive Canadian statutory rate
    reductions that were enacted in each such year.

In 2006, deferred income taxes increased $39 million due to
    the effect of a new income-based tax enacted by the state of
    Texas that replaced a previous franchise tax. The new tax was
    effective January 1, 2007. The $39 million increase is
    included in 2006 state income taxes in the above table.

During 2008, Devon repatriated $2.6 billion from certain
    foreign subsidiaries to the United States. Subsequent to these
    repatriations, Devon does not expect to repatriate similar
    earnings from its historical operations in the foreseeable
    future. Also in the second quarter of 2008, Devon made certain
    tax policy election changes to minimize the taxes Devon
    otherwise would pay for the cash repatriations, as well as the
    taxable gains associated with the sales of assets in West Africa.

As a result of the repatriations, as well as the tax policy
    election changes, Devon recognized additional tax expense of
    $307 million during 2008. Of the $307 million,
    $290 million was recognized as current income tax expense,
    and $17 million was recognized as deferred tax expense.

Deferred
    Tax Assets and Liabilities

At December 31, 2008, Devon had the following net operating
    loss carryforwards, which are available to reduce future taxable
    income in the jurisdiction where the net operating loss was
    incurred. These carryforwards will result in a future tax
    reduction based upon the future tax rate applicable to the
    taxable income that is ultimately offset by the net operating
    loss carryforward. For financial purposes, the tax effects of
    these carryforwards, net of any valuation allowances, have been
    recognized as reductions to the net deferred tax liability at
    December 31, 2008.

As shown in the above table, Devon has recognized
    $717 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31,
    2008, net of a $61 million valuation allowance. Included in
    total deferred tax assets is $74 million related to various
    carryforwards available to offset future income taxes. The
    carryforwards include state net operating loss carryforwards,
    which expire primarily between 2009 and 2022, Canadian net
    operating loss carryforwards, which expire primarily between
    2025 and 2027, and Brazilian net operating loss carryforwards,
    which have no expiration. The tax benefits of carryforwards are
    recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the
    utilization of such carryforwards to be “more likely than
    not.” When the future utilization of some portion of the
    carryforwards is determined not to be “more likely than
    not,” a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the
    recorded tax benefits from such assets.

Devon expects the tax benefits from the state and Canadian net
    operating loss carryforwards to be utilized between 2009 and
    2013. Such expectation is based upon current estimates of
    taxable income during this period, considering limitations on
    the annual utilization of these benefits as set forth by tax
    regulations. Significant changes in such estimates caused by
    variables such as future oil and gas prices or capital
    expenditures could alter the timing of the eventual utilization
    of such carryforwards. There can be no assurance that Devon will
    generate any specific level of continuing taxable earnings.
    However, management believes that Devon’s future taxable
    income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize
    substantially all its state and Canadian tax carryforwards prior
    to their expiration.

Included in deferred tax assets for net operating loss
    carryforwards as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 is
    $61 million and $64 million, respectively, related to
    the Brazil carryforward. Although this carryforward has no
    expiration, management is uncertain whether Devon’s future
    taxable income will be sufficient to utilize its



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Brazil carryforward. This uncertainty is based upon annual
    limitations on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards
    available to reduce taxable income, Devon’s lack of
    historical taxable income in Brazil and the exploratory nature
    of several of Devon’s current projects in Brazil.
    Therefore, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, Devon had a
    valuation allowance of $61 million and $50 million,
    respectively, related to this carryforward.

    various stages of the administrative review process for certain
    open tax years. In addition, Devon is currently subject to
    various income tax audits that have not reached the
    administrative review process. As a result, Devon cannot
    reasonably anticipate the extent that the liabilities for
    unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the
    next twelve months.

Discontinued
    Operations

Egypt
    and West Africa

In November 2006 and January 2007, Devon announced its plans to
    divest its operations in Egypt and West Africa, including
    Equatorial Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon and other countries
    in the region.

In October 2007, Devon completed the sale of its Egyptian
    operations and received proceeds of $341 million. As a
    result of this sale, Devon recognized a $90 million
    after-tax gain in the fourth quarter of 2007.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

In the second quarter of 2008, Devon sold its assets and
    terminated its operations in certain West African countries,
    consisting primarily of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. As a result
    of the sales, Devon recognized gains totaling $736 million
    ($674 million after income taxes) in 2008 from proceeds of
    $2.4 billion ($1.7 billion net of income taxes and
    purchase price adjustments).

In the third quarter of 2008, Devon sold its assets and
    terminated its operations in Cote d’Ivoire. As a result of
    this sale, Devon recognized a gain of $83 million
    ($95 million after income taxes) in 2008 from proceeds of
    $205 million ($163 million net of income taxes and
    purchase price adjustments).

With the Cote d’Ivoire transaction, Devon completed the
    divestitures of all its oil and gas producing properties in
    Africa. The Africa divestitures generated just over
    $3.0 billion of sales proceeds. After income taxes and
    purchase price adjustments, such proceeds totaled
    $2.2 billion and generated after-tax gains of
    $0.8 billion.

Revenues related to Devon’s operations in Egypt and West
    Africa totaled $349 million, $781 million and
    $929 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    following table presents the main classes of assets and
    liabilities associated with Devon’s operations in Egypt and
    West Africa as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. As of
    December 31, 2008, the remaining assets and liabilities
    primarily are associated with nonproducing oil and gas

Reductions

Based on drilling activities in Nigeria, Devon reduced the
    carrying value of its Nigerian assets held for sale in 2008 and
    2007. As a result, earnings from discontinued operations include
    after-tax losses of $6 million ($6 million pre-tax)
    and $13 million ($64 million pre-tax) in 2008 and
    2007, respectively.



DEVON
    ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

As a result of unsuccessful exploratory activities in Egypt
    during 2006, the net book value of Devon’s Egyptian oil and
    gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, exceeded the
    ceiling by $18 million as of the end of September 30,
    2006. Therefore, in 2006, Devon recognized an $18 million
    after-tax loss ($31 million pre-tax).

Due to unsuccessful drilling activities in Nigeria, in the first
    quarter of 2006, Devon recognized an $85 million impairment
    of its investment in Nigeria equal to the costs to drill two dry
    holes and a proportionate share of block-related costs. There
    was no income tax benefit related to this impairment.

(Loss)
    Earnings Per Share

The following table reconciles earnings from continuing
    operations and common shares outstanding used in the
    calculations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for
    2008, 2007 and 2006. The 2008 diluted per share calculations
    include an increase of four million common shares outstanding
    due to dilutive shares. However, because a net loss from
    continuing operations was generated during 2008, the dilutive
    shares produce an antidilutive net loss per share result.
    Therefore, the diluted loss per share from continuing operations
    reported in the accompanying 2008 statement of operations
    is the same as the basic loss per share amount.

Pursuant to the full cost method of accounting, Devon
    capitalizes certain of its general and administrative expenses
    that are related to property acquisition, exploration and
    development activities. Such capitalized expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $406 million, $312 million and $243 million in
    the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also, Devon
    capitalizes interest costs incurred and attributable to unproved
    oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and
    gas properties. Capitalized interest expenses, which are
    included in the costs shown in the preceding tables, were
    $96 million, $65 million and $49 million in the
    years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Results
    of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities

The following tables include revenues and expenses associated
    directly with Devon’s continuing oil and gas producing
    activities, including general and administrative expenses
    directly related to such producing activities. They do not
    include any allocation of Devon’s interest costs or general
    corporate overhead and, therefore, are not necessarily
    indicative of the contribution to net earnings of Devon’s
    oil and gas operations.

“Prepared” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were prepared by an independent petroleum consultant.
    “Audited” reserves are those quantities of reserves
    that were estimated by Devon employees and audited by an
    independent petroleum consultant. An audit is an examination of
    a company’s proved oil and gas reserves and net cash flow
    by an independent petroleum consultant that is conducted for the
    purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such estimates,
    in aggregate, are reasonable and have been estimated and
    presented in conformity with generally accepted petroleum
    engineering and evaluation principles.

The domestic reserves were evaluated by the independent
    petroleum consultants of LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and
    Ryder Scott Company, L.P. in each of the years presented. The
    Canadian reserves were evaluated by the independent petroleum
    consultants of AJM Petroleum Consultants in each of the years
    presented. The International reserves were evaluated by the
    independent petroleum consultants of Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
    in each of the years presented.

Included in the International quantities of proved reserves as
    of December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are
    104 MMBoe, 86 MMBoe, 103 MMBoe and
    105 MMBoe, respectively, which are attributable to
    production sharing contracts with various foreign governments.

Noteworthy amounts included in the categories of proved reserve
    changes for the years 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 in the above
    tables include:

•

Price Revisions

— Proved reserves must be
    estimated using the assumption that

end-of-period

prices and costs remain constant for the duration of the
    reservoir life. Due to significantly lower oil, gas and NGL
    prices as of December 31, 2008 compared to prices as of
    December 31, 2007, the estimated future net revenues
    associated with certain of Devon’s proved reserves were no
    longer positive. As a result, 473 MMBoe of reserves were
    not considered proved as of December 31, 2008. Of the

473 MMBoe price revisions, 331 MMBoe related to
    Devon’s Jackfish steam-assisted gravity drainage project in
    Canada.

The 473 MMBoe price revision also includes 28 MMBoe
    related to our proved reserves in the Canadian province of
    Alberta. In December 2008, the provincial government of Alberta
    enacted a new royalty regime. The new regime provides for new
    royalties for conventional oil, gas, NGL and heavy oil
    production effective January 1, 2009. As a result of the
    newly enacted royalties, our proved reserves decreased as of
    December 31, 2008.

Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices
    (averaging $32.65 per barrel of oil, $4.75 per Mcf of gas and
    $16.54 per barrel of natural gas liquids at December 31,
    2008) to the year-end quantities of proved reserves, except
    in those instances where fixed and determinable price changes
    are provided by contractual arrangements in existence at
    year-end.

Future development and production costs are computed by
    estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
    producing proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year,
    based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing
    economic conditions. Of the $9.3 billion of future
    development costs as of the end of 2008, $1.7 billion,
    $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion are estimated to be
    spent in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Future development costs include not only development costs, but
    also future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation costs.
    Included as part of the $9.3 billion of future development
    costs are $2.0 billion of future dismantlement, abandonment
    and rehabilitation costs.

Future production costs include general and administrative
    expenses directly related to oil and gas producing activities.
    Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
    appropriate statutory tax rates to the future pre-tax net cash
    flows relating to proved reserves, net of the tax basis of the
    properties involved. The future income tax expenses give effect
    to permanent differences and tax credits, but do not reflect the
    impact of future operations.

Earnings

The fourth quarter of 2008 includes reductions of the carrying
    values of oil and gas properties totaling $10.4 billion
    ($7.1 billion after income taxes, or $16.10 per diluted
    share).

The first and second quarters of 2008 include unrealized losses
    on our commodity hedges of $780 million ($499 million
    after income taxes, or $1.11 per diluted share) and
    $912 million ($584 million after income taxes, or
    $1.30 per diluted share), respectively, as a result of increases
    in gas prices subsequent to our trade dates. The third quarter
    of 2008 includes a net unrealized gain of $1.8 billion
    ($1.2 billion after income taxes, or $2.63 per diluted
    share), resulting from a decrease in gas prices.

The second quarter of 2008 includes an increase to income tax
    expense from continuing operations of $312 million (or
    $0.70 per diluted share) due to repatriations from certain
    foreign subsidiaries to the United States and tax policy
    election changes.

The second and fourth quarters of 2007 include a reduction to
    income tax expense from continuing operations of
    $30 million (or $0.07 per diluted share) and
    $231 million (or $0.52 per diluted share), respectively,
    due to statutory rate reductions in Canada.

Earnings
    from Discontinued Operations

The second quarter of 2008 includes a $623 million gain
    ($529 million after income taxes, or $1.17 per diluted
    share) as a result of completing the sale of Devon’s
    Equatorial Guinea operations. Also, during the second quarter of
    2008, Devon closed the sale of its Gabon operations, which
    resulted in a $114 million gain ($111 million after
    income taxes, or $0.25 per diluted share).

The third quarter of 2008 includes an $83 million gain
    ($101 million after income taxes, or $0.23 per diluted
    share) as a result of completing the sale of Devon’s assets
    in Cote d’Ivoire.

The second quarter of 2007 includes a reduction of carrying
    value of oil and gas properties of $64 million
    ($13 million after income taxes, or $0.03 per diluted
    share).

The fourth quarter of 2007 includes a $90 million gain
    ($90 million after income taxes, or $0.20 per diluted
    share) as a result of completing the sale of Devon’s assets
    in Egypt in October 2007.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
    that material information relating to Devon, including its
    consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
    certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of
    senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and
    principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective
    as of December 31, 2008 to ensure that the information
    required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files
    or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Devon’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    for Devon, as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision
    and with the participation of Devon’s management, including
    our principal executive and principal financial officers, Devon
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this
    evaluation under the COSO Framework, which was completed on
    February 20, 2009, management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
    firm who audited Devon’s consolidated financial statements
    as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, as stated
    in their report, which is included under “Item 8.
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in Devon’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2008 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.
