Item 1. BUSINESS

Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings and its subsidiaries (the “Company”),
headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina, is the second largest independent clinical
laboratory company in the United States based on 2005 net revenues. Since the
Company’s founding in 1971, it has grown into a national network of 36 primary
laboratories and over 1,300 service sites, consisting of branches, patient service centers
and STAT laboratories (which are laboratories that have the ability to perform certain
routine tests quickly and report the results to the physician immediately). Through its
national network of laboratories, the Company offers a broad range of clinical laboratory
tests which are used by the medical profession in routine testing, patient diagnosis, and
in the monitoring and treatment of disease. In addition, the Company has developed
specialty testing businesses based on certain types of specialized testing capabilities
and client requirements, such as oncology testing, HIV genotyping and phenotyping,
diagnostic genetics and clinical research trials.

With
approximately 24,000 employees, the Company processes tests on more than 360,000 patient
specimens daily and provides clinical laboratory testing services to clients in all 50
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Belgium, and three provinces in Canada. Its
clients include physicians, hospitals, HMOs and other managed care organizations,
governmental agencies, large employers, and other independent clinical laboratories that
do not have the breadth of its testing capabilities. Several hundred of the Company’s
tests are frequently used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a
diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. The
most frequently-requested of these routine tests include blood chemistry analyses,
urinalyses, blood cell counts, Pap tests, HIV tests, microbiology cultures and procedures,
and alcohol and other substance-abuse tests. The Company performs this core group of
routine tests in each of its major laboratories using sophisticated and computerized
instruments, with most results reported within 24 hours. In addition, the Company provides
specialty testing services in the areas of allergy, clinical trials, diagnostic genetics,
identity, infectious disease, oncology and occupational testing.

The
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports
on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through
the Media and Investor Relations section of the Company’s internet website at
www.labcorp.com as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with,
or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The
Company is committed to providing the highest quality laboratory services to our clients
in full compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. The
Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines ethics and compliance policies
adopted by the Company to meet this commitment. These policies apply to all employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries as well as the Company’s Board of Directors. The
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as well as the Charters for the Audit, Compensation,
Ethics and Quality Assurance, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, and the
Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, are posted on the Company’s website
www.labcorp.com. The Company has established a Compliance Action hotline (1-800-801-1005),
which provides a confidential and anonymous method to report a possible violation of a
LabCorp compliance policy or procedure, or a federal or state law or regulation; a HIPAA
Privacy hotline (1-877-234-4722), which provides a confidential and anonymous method for
an employee to report a possible violation of a HIPAA privacy, security or billing policy
or procedure; and an Accounting hotline (1-866-469-6893), which provides a confidential
and anonymous method for an employee to report a possible violation of internal accounting
controls or auditing matters.

The Clinical Laboratory
Testing Industry

Laboratory
tests and procedures are used generally by hospitals, physicians and other health care
providers and commercial clients to assist in the diagnosis, evaluation, detection,
monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions through the examination
of substances in the blood, tissues and other specimens. Clinical laboratory testing is
generally categorized as either clinical pathology testing, which is performed on body
fluids including blood, or anatomical pathology testing, which is performed on histologic
or cytologic samples (e.g., tissue and other samples, including human cells). Clinical and
anatomical pathology procedures are frequently ordered as part of regular physician

(4)

office visits and hospital admissions
in connection with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses. Certain of these tests and
procedures are used as tools in the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of medical
conditions such as cancer, AIDS, endocrine disorders, cardiac disorders and genetic
disease.

The
clinical laboratory industry consists primarily of three types of providers:
hospital-based laboratories, physician-office laboratories and independent clinical
laboratories, such as those owned by the Company. The Company believes that in 2003 the
entire United States clinical laboratory testing industry had estimated revenues of
approximately $40 billion; approximately 53% of such revenues were attributable to
hospital-affiliated laboratories, approximately 40% were attributable to independent
clinical laboratories and others, and approximately 7% were attributable to physicians in
their offices and laboratories. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has
estimated that in 2003 there were approximately 5,000 independent clinical laboratories in
the United States.

The
clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive. There are presently two national
independent clinical laboratories: the Company and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated
(“Quest”), which had approximately $5.5 billion in revenues from clinical
laboratory testing in 2005. In addition to Quest, the Company competes with many smaller
independent clinical and anatomical laboratories as well as laboratories owned by
hospitals and physicians. The Company believes that health care providers in selecting a
laboratory often use the following factors, among others:

•

accuracy, timeliness and
consistency in reporting test results;

•

its reputation in the medical community;

•

service capability and convenience offered by the laboratory;

•

number and type of tests
performed; and

•

pricing of the laboratory’s test services.

The
Company believes that it competes favorably with its principal competitors in each of
these areas and is currently implementing strategies to improve its competitive position.

The
Company believes that consolidation will continue in the clinical laboratory testing
business. In addition, the Company believes that it and the other large independent
clinical laboratory testing companies will be able to increase their share of the overall
clinical laboratory testing market due to a number of external factors including cost
efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing, Medicare reimbursement reductions
and the growth of managed health care entities which require low-cost testing services and
large service networks. In addition, legal restrictions on physician referrals and their
ownership of laboratories as well as increased regulation of laboratories are expected to
contribute to the continuing consolidation of the industry.

Effect of Market Changes
on the Clinical Laboratory Business

Many
market-based changes in the clinical laboratory business have occurred over the past ten
years, primarily as a result of the shift away from traditional, fee-for-service medicine
to managed-cost health care. The growth of the managed care sector and consolidation of
managed care companies presents various challenges and opportunities to the Company and
other independent clinical laboratories. Managed care organizations typically contract
with a limited number of clinical laboratories and negotiate discounts to the fees charged
by such laboratories; therefore, the Company’s ability to attract and retain managed
care clients will be critical. In addition, managed care organizations have used capitated
payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their
enrollees. Under a capitated payment contract, the clinical laboratory and the managed
care organization agree to a per member, per month payment to pay for all authorized
laboratory tests ordered during the month by the members, regardless of the number or cost
of the tests actually performed. The Company makes significant efforts to ensure that
esoteric tests (which are more sophisticated tests used to obtain information not provided
by routine tests and generally involve a higher level of complexity and more substantial
human involvement than routine tests) are excluded from capitated arrangements and
therefore paid for separately by the managed care organization. Capitated payment
contracts shift the risks of additional testing beyond that covered by the capitated
payment to the clinical laboratory. For the year

(5)

ended December 31, 2005, such
capitated contracts accounted for approximately $136.5 million or 4.1% of the
Company’s net sales.

In
addition, Medicare (which principally services patients 65 and older), Medicaid (which
principally services low-income patients) and insurers have increased their efforts to
control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. Measures to regulate
health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have resulted in
reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory
industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative
requirements. From time to time, Congress has also considered changes to the Medicare fee
schedules in conjunction with certain budgetary bills. The Company believes that
reductions in reimbursement for Medicare services will continue to be implemented from
time to time. Reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers are likely
to occur as well.

Despite
the potential market changes discussed above, the Company believes that the volume of
clinical laboratory testing will be positively influenced by several factors, including
increased knowledge of the human genome leading to an enhanced appreciation of the value
of gene-based diagnostic assays and the development of new therapeutics. Additionally,
these novel gene-based tests have led to an increased awareness by physicians that
clinical laboratory testing is a cost-effective means of prevention and early detection of
disease and monitoring of treatment.

Additional
factors which may lead to future volume growth include an increase in the number and types
of tests which are readily available (due to advances in technology and increased cost
efficiencies) for testing of cancer and infectious diseases and the general aging of the
population in the United States. The impact of these factors is expected to be partially
offset by declines in volume as a result of increased controls over the utilization of
laboratory services by Medicare and other third-party payers, particularly managed care
organizations. In addition, movement by patients into consumer driven health plans may
have an impact on the utilization of laboratory testing.

Company Strategy

The
Company’s strategic plan focuses on three critical priorities that provide maximum
opportunity for continued growth and profitability. They are scientific differentiation,
customer retention, and managed care.

Scientific Differentiation

The
Company believes that it has differentiated itself from its competition and positioned
itself for continued strong growth by building a leadership position in genomic and other
advanced testing technologies. This leadership position enables the Company to provide a
broad menu of testing services in the genetics and cancer markets, which it believes
represent two of the most significant areas of future growth in the clinical laboratory
industry. The Company’s strategic objective is to expand its leadership position in
genomic and other advanced testing technologies in order to deliver outstanding and
innovative clinical testing services to patients and physicians nationwide.

The
Company’s acquisitions of DIANON Systems, Inc. (“DIANON”), US Pathology
Labs, Inc. (“US LABS”) and Esoterix, Inc. (“Esoterix”) position the
Company as the leading provider of cancer and specialty testing in the United States.
These companies are recognized by physicians, managed care companies and other customers
as leading providers of a wide range of anatomic pathology testing services, with
particular strength in uropathology, dermatopathology, GI pathology and hematopathology.
The Company expects that the specialized sales force, scientific expertise, efficient
operating model and proprietary clinical and pathology reporting systems of these
acquisitions will allow it to continue to enhance its cancer testing business. The Company
began extending DIANON’s standardized anatomic pathology processes to other Company
pathology sites in early 2004 and has to date implemented these best practices in nine
major Company sites.

Managed Care

Strong
managed care partnerships are key to the Company, both to secure appropriate payment for
our services and as distribution channels for the Company’s new and existing
products. As such, they also

(6)

contribute to the establishment and
implementation of our scientific leadership priorities. The Company has devoted
substantial business and scientific resources to our managed care customers to ensure that
it is providing this growing segment with the creative solutions and quality services that
they expect. The Company’s external Managed Care Advisory Panel and internal Managed
Care Economic and Scientific Advisory Review Process are critical to understanding the
evolution of this business segment and communicating the economic and social benefits of
advanced laboratory testing.

The
Company’s growing national presence provides a number of significant benefits and it
intends to maintain and continue to build this presence. The Company’s national
network enables it to provide high-quality services to physicians, hospitals, managed care
organizations and other customers across the United States. The Company’s managed
care contracts with United Healthcare, Aetna, Cigna, and Wellpoint demonstrate the
importance of being able to deliver services on a nationwide basis. Furthermore, the
Company’s scale provides it with significant cost structure advantages, particularly
related to supply and other operating costs.

Customer Retention

Providing
exceptional customer service is one of the Company’s highest priorities. Customer
retention requires understanding the unique needs and challenges that face each of our
customer segments and providing solutions that address them. The Company continually seeks
to improve its offerings in physician education tools, integrated information management
solutions, improved customer care initiatives and innovative patient information guides.
These customer retention activities are designed to further our success in all aspects of
our business.

In
September 2005, the Company announced the launch of

e

LabCorp, a web based
connectivity solution for the Company’s physician clients.

e

LabCorp is a key
building block in the Company’s connectivity strategy and further enhances the
options available to physicians to more easily order tests and access results.

e

LabCorp provides a web-based connectivity solution that integrates easily with a
wide variety of existing electronic medical records and practice management systems,
allowing physicians to access the web for testing services without changing the computer
systems they use for the rest of their practice needs.

Laboratory Testing
Operations and Services

The
Company has 36 primary laboratories, and over 1,300 service sites, consisting of branches,
patient service centers and STAT laboratories. A branch is a central facility which
collects specimens in a region for shipment to one of the Company’s laboratories for
testing. A branch also is used as a base for sales staff. Generally, a patient service
center is a facility maintained by the Company to serve the patients of physicians in a
medical professional building or other strategic location. The patient service center
collects the specimens as requested by the physician. The specimens are sent, principally
through the Company’s in-house courier system (and, to a lesser extent, through
independent couriers), to one of the Company’s primary testing facilities for
testing. Some of the Company’s patient service centers also function as STAT labs,
which are laboratories that have the ability to perform certain routine tests quickly and
report results to the physician immediately. Patient specimens are delivered to the
Company accompanied by a test request form. These forms, which are completed by the client
or the Company Patient Service Technician, indicate the tests to be performed and provide
the necessary billing information.

Each
specimen and related request form is checked for completeness and then given a unique
identification number. The unique identification number assigned to each specimen helps to
ensure that the results are attributed to the correct patient. The test request forms are
sent to a data entry operator who ensures that a file is established for each patient and
the necessary testing and billing information is entered. Once this information is entered
into the computer system, the tests are performed and the results are entered through
computer interface or manually, depending upon the tests and the type of equipment
involved. Most of the Company’s computerized testing equipment is connected to the
Company’s information systems. Most routine testing is completed by early the next
morning and test results are in most cases electronically delivered to clients via smart
printers, personal computer-based products or computer interfaces.

Testing Services

Routine Testing

The
Company currently offers a broad range of clinical laboratory tests and procedures.
Several hundred of these are frequently used in general patient care by physicians to
establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or medication, or to search for an
otherwise undiagnosed condition. The most frequently requested tests include blood
chemistry analyses, thyroid tests, urinalyses, blood cell counts, Pap tests, HIV tests,
microbiology cultures and procedures and alcohol and other substance-abuse tests. These
routine procedures are most often used by physicians in their outpatient office practices.
Physicians may elect to send such procedures to an independent laboratory or they may
choose to establish an in-house laboratory to perform some of the tests.

The
Company performs this core group of routine tests in each of its primary laboratories,
which constitutes a majority of the testing performed by the Company. The Company
generally performs and reports most routine procedures within 24 hours, utilizing a
variety of sophisticated and computerized laboratory testing instruments.

Specialty Testing

While
the information provided by many routine tests may be used by nearly all physicians,
regardless of specialty, many other procedures are more specialized in nature. One of the
growth strategies of the Company is the continued expansion of its specialty testing
businesses, which involve certain types of unique testing capabilities and/or client
requirements. In general, the specialty testing businesses are designed to serve two
market segments: (i) markets which are not typically served by the clinical testing
laboratory; and (ii) markets which are served by the clinical testing laboratory and offer
the possibility of adding related services (such as clinical trials or occupational drug
testing) from the same supplier. The Company’s research and development group
continually seeks new and improved technologies for early diagnosis. For example, the
Company’s Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology (“CMBP”) is a leader
in molecular diagnostics and polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) technologies,
which are often able to provide earlier and more reliable information regarding HIV,
genetic diseases, cancer and many other viral and bacterial diseases. In August 2000, the
Company acquired Los Angeles-based National Genetics Institute, Inc. (NGI), a leader in
the development of PCR assays for Hepatitis C (HCV). In June 2001, the Company acquired
Minneapolis-based Viro-Med Laboratories, Inc., which offers molecular microbial testing
using real time PCR platforms. In January 2003, the Company acquired Stratford-based
Dianon Systems, Inc. a leader in Anatomic Pathology testing. In February 2005, the Company
acquired Irvine-based US LABS, a leader in Anatomic Pathology and oncology testing
services. In May 2005, the Company acquired Austin-based Esoterix, a leading provider of
specialty reference testing. Management believes these technologies may represent a
significant savings to the healthcare system by increasing the detection of early stage
(treatable) diseases. The following are specialty testing businesses in which the Company
offers testing and related services:

Allergy
Testing.

The Company offers an extensive range of allergen testing services as well as
computerized analysis and a treatment program that enables primary care physicians to
diagnose and treat many kinds of allergic disorders.

Clinical
Trials Testing

. The Company regularly performs clinical laboratory testing for
pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical research trials on new drugs. This testing
often involves periodic testing of patients participating in the trial over several years.

Diagnostic
Genetics.

The Company offers cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, biochemical and
molecular genetic tests.

Identity
Testing.

The Company provides forensic identity testing used in connection with
criminal proceedings and parentage evaluation services which are used to assist in the
resolution of disputed parentage in child support litigation. Parentage testing involves
the evaluation of immunological and genetic markers in specimens obtained from the child,
the mother and the alleged father. Management believes it is now the largest provider of
identity testing services in the United States.

(8)

Infectious
Disease

. The Company provides complete viral load testing as well as HIV genotyping
and phenotyping. In 2000, the Company added HIV GenoSure™ to its portfolio of HIV
resistance testing services. The Company’s use of this leading-edge technology puts
it in the forefront of HIV drug resistance testing one of the most important issues
surrounding the treatment of HIV. Additionally, the Company provides comprehensive testing
for HCV including both PCR testing and genotyping at CMBP, NGI and Viro-Med.

Oncology
Testing

. The Company offers an extensive series of testing technologies that aid in
diagnosing and monitoring certain cancers and predicting the outcome of certain
treatments. The acquisitions of Dianon, US LABS and Esoterix further expand the
company’s capabilities in specialized pathology, including hematopathology.

Occupational
Testing Services

. The Company provides urine and blood testing services for the
detection of drug and alcohol abuse for private and government customers. These testing
services are designed to produce “forensic” quality test results that satisfy
the rigorous requirements for admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings. The Company
also provides other analytical testing and a variety of management support services.

The
specialized testing services noted above, as well as other complex procedures, are sent to
designated facilities where the Company has concentrated the people, instruments and
related resources for performing such procedures so that quality and efficiency can be
most effectively monitored. CMBP, NGI, Viro-Med, Dianon, US LABS and Esoterix also
specialize in new test development and related education and training.

Development of New Tests

Advances
in medicine have begun to fundamentally change diagnostic testing, and new tests are
allowing clinical laboratories to provide unprecedented amounts of health-related
information to physicians and patients. Significant new tests introduced over the past
several years include a gene-based test for human papilloma virus as well as tests for HIV
phenotyping and cystic fibrosis. As science continues to advance, the Company expects new
testing technologies to emerge; therefore, it intends to continue to invest in advanced
testing capabilities so that it can remain on the cutting edge of clinical laboratory
testing. The Company has added, and expects to continue to add, new testing technologies
and capabilities through a combination of internal development initiatives, technology
licensing and partnership transactions and selected business acquisitions. Through its
national sales force, the Company rapidly introduces new testing technologies to physician
customers. This differentiation is important in the retention and growth of business.

In
an effort to better offer new technology as medical needs and standards of care develop,
the Company has entered into a number of licensing and technology distribution agreements
with such leading-edge diagnostic testing technology providers as: Atherotech and
LipoScience (cardiovascular disease risk assessment), Roche, EXACT Sciences (colorectal
cancer detection), BioPredictive (determination of liver fibrosis), and Cytyc (Pap
screening). Details on some of these agreements are provided below:

Atherotech

— In July 2003, the Company announced a marketing and distribution relationship with
Atherotech, a leading cardiodiagnostic company and specialty reference laboratory, to
offer its proprietary Vertical Auto Profile (VAP™) Cholesterol Test. This multi-year
agreement includes a provision for the transfer of patented testing technology to the
Company, after which, if certain conditions are met, the Company would become the first
clinical laboratory licensed to perform the VAP cardiovascular disease risk assessment
assay within its own national laboratory system.

LipoScience
—

In August 2005, LabCorp entered an agreement with Raleigh, NC based LipoScience
to offer its proprietary NMR LipoProfile® test. The LipoProfile test is a blood test
which has been shown in numerous clinical studies to be superior to LDL-cholesterol in
predicting coronary heart disease events.

Roche

— In July 2005, the Company announced that it will begin validation testing of Roche
Diagnostics’ Amplichip CYP450 test. The AmpliChip CYP450 test has been cleared by the
US Food

(9)

and
Drug Administration for diagnostic use. AmpliChip CYP450 test results will allow
physicians to consider genetic information from patients in selecting medications for a
wide variety of common conditions such as cardiac disease, chronic pain, cancer and
psychiatric disorders. In November 2005, the Company announced the availability of
Amplichip P450 testing services.

EXACT
Sciences

— In June 2002, the Company announced the creation of an exclusive,
long-term strategic agreement with EXACT Sciences to commercialize PreGen-Plus, EXACT
Sciences’ proprietary, non-invasive technology to aid in the early detection of
colorectal cancer. The Company commercially launched this gene-based test, which
represents a significant new tool for the early detection of colorectal cancer, in August
of 2003.

BioPredictive

— During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company and BioPredictive, a French
diagnostics firm, announced an exclusive agreement that combines the Company’s
expertise in infectious disease testing with BioPredictive’s noninvasive, predictive
testing technology to quantitatively estimate liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory
activity in hepatitis C (“HCV”) patients. HCV FIBROSURE™ was made available
in the U.S., only through the Company, beginning in the first quarter of 2004.

Cytyc

— During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a multi-year
agreement with Cytyc for their ThinPrep Imaging System. The ThinPrep Imaging System is the
first fully integrated, interactive computer system that assists cytotechnologists and
pathologists in the primary screening and diagnosis of ThinPrep Pap Test slides.

In
addition to the above mentioned license and technology distribution agreements, in August
of 2003, the Company formed a new, majority-owned subsidiary for the purpose of developing
new ideas, inventions, products, processes and services for diagnostic testing and
monitoring in the medical, pharmaceutical, and/or therapeutic markets. The initial areas
of interest include West Nile Virus, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, Oxidative Markers of
DNA stress and Cancer Markers.

The
Company’s investment in new testing technologies has been significant. While the
Company continues to believe its strategy of entering into licensing and technology
distribution agreements with the developers of leading-edge technologies will provide
future growth in revenues, there are certain risks associated with these investments.
These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that the licensed technology will
not gain broad acceptance in the marketplace; or that insurance companies, managed care
organizations, or Medicare and Medicaid will not approve reimbursement for these tests at
a level commensurate with the costs of running the tests. Any or all of these
circumstances could result in impairment in the value of certain capitalized licensing
costs.

Clients

The
Company provides testing services to a broad range of health care providers. During the
year ended December 31, 2005, no client or group of clients under the same contract
accounted for more than four percent of the Company’s net sales. The primary client
groups serviced by the Company include:

Independent Physicians and Physician Groups

Physicians
requiring testing for their patients are one of the Company’s primary sources of
testing services. Fees for clinical laboratory testing services rendered for these
physicians are billed either to the physician, to the patient or the patient’s third
party payer such as an insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid. Billings are typically on
a fee-for-service basis. If the billings are to the physician, they are based on a
customer fee schedule and subject to negotiation. Otherwise, the patient or third party
payer is billed at the laboratory’s patient fee schedule, subject to third party
payer limitations and negotiation by physicians on behalf of their patients. Revenues
received from Medicare and Medicaid billings are based on government-set fee schedules and
reimbursement rules.

(10)

Hospitals

The
Company provides hospitals with services ranging from routine and specialty testing to
contract management services. Hospitals generally maintain an on-site laboratory to
perform immediately needed testing on patients receiving care. However, they also refer
less time sensitive procedures, less frequently needed procedures and highly specialized
procedures to outside facilities, including independent clinical laboratories and larger
medical centers. The Company typically charges hospitals for any such tests on a
fee-for-service basis which is derived from the Company’s customer fee schedule. Fees
for management services are billed monthly at contractually agreed-upon rates.

HMOs and Other Managed Care Groups

The
Company serves HMOs and other managed care organizations. These medical service providers
typically contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and then designate the
laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. The
majority of the Company’s managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service
basis. Testing is sometimes reimbursed on a capitated basis for managed care
organizations. Under a capitated payment contract, the Company agrees to perform certain
laboratory tests during a given month for which the managed care organization agrees to
pay a flat monthly fee for each covered member. The tests covered under agreements of this
type are negotiated for each contract, but usually include routine tests and exclude
highly specialized tests. Many of the national and large regional managed care
organizations prefer to use large independent clinical labs such as the Company because
they can monitor service and performance on a national basis.

Other Institutions

The
Company serves other institutions, including governmental agencies, large employers and
other independent clinical laboratories that do not have the breadth of the Company’s
testing capabilities. The institutions typically pay on a negotiated fee-for-service
basis.

Payers

Most
testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person
who ordered the test. In addition, tests performed by a single physician may be billed to
different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient.
Payers other than the direct patient include, among others, insurance companies, managed
care organizations, Medicare and Medicaid. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
accessions (based on the total volume of accessions) and average revenue per accession by

Investments in Joint
Venture Partnerships

In
conjunction with the acquisition of Dynacare in 2002, the Company holds investments in
three joint venture partnerships, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Ontario, Canada; and
Alberta, Canada. These businesses represent partnership agreements between Dynacare and
other independent diagnostic laboratory investors. Under these agreements, all partners
share in the profits and losses of the businesses in proportion to their respective
ownership percentages. All partners are actively involved in the major business decisions
made by each joint venture.

Each
of the Canadian partnerships own licenses to conduct diagnostic testing services in their
respective provinces. Substantially all of their revenues are received as reimbursement
from the provincial governments’ health care programs. While the Canadian licenses
guarantee the joint ventures the ability to conduct diagnostic testing in their respective
provinces, they do not guarantee that the provincial governments will continue to
reimburse diagnostic laboratory testing at current levels. If the provincial

(11)

governments decide to limit or reduce
their reimbursement of laboratory diagnostic services, it could have a negative impact on
the profits and cash flows the Company derives from these investments as well as possibly
impair the value assigned by the Company to the Canadian joint ventures.

Sales and Marketing and
Client Service

The
Company offers its services through a sales force focused on serving the specific needs of
customers in different market segments. These market segments generally include Specialty
Cancer, Hospitals, and Primary Care. The Company’s sales force is compensated through
a combination of salaries, commissions and bonuses, at levels commensurate with each
individual’s qualifications and responsibilities. Commissions are primarily based
upon the individual’s productivity in generating new business for the Company, from
new and existing customers.

The
Company also employs regional service managers and key account executives
(“KAEs”) to interact with clients on an ongoing basis. KAEs monitor the status
of the services being provided to clients, act as problem-solvers, provide information on
new testing developments and serve as the client’s regular point of contact with the
Company. KAEs are compensated through a combination of salaries, bonuses, and commissions
commensurate with each individual’s qualifications, performance, and
responsibilities.

The
Company believes that the clinical laboratory service business is shifting away from the
traditional direct sales structure to one in which the purchasing decisions for laboratory
services are increasingly being made by managed care organizations, insurance plans,
employers and even by patients themselves. In view of these changes, the Company has
adapted its sales and marketing structure to more appropriately address the opportunities
presented by this shift.

The
Company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of its testing, reporting and
information systems, its reputation in the medical community, client service, test menu,
the pricing of its services and its ability to employ qualified personnel.

Information Systems

The
Company has developed and implemented management information systems to monitor and
facilitate operations and to control costs. Substantially all financial functions are
centralized in Burlington, North Carolina including purchasing, accounting, payroll and
billing. Management believes this provides greater control over spending as well as
increased supervision and monitoring of results of operations.

The
Company believes that the health care provider’s need for data will continue to place
high demands on the Company’s information systems staff. The Company operates several
systems to handle laboratory, billing and financial data and transactions. The Company
believes that the efficient handling of information involving clients, patients, payers
and other parties will be a critical factor in the Company’s future success. The
Company’s Corporate Information Systems Division manages its information resources
and programs on a consolidated basis in order to achieve greater efficiency and economies
of scale. The Company employs a Chief Information Officer, whose responsibility is to
integrate, manage and develop the Company’s information systems.

Billing

Billing
for laboratory services is a complicated process involving many different payers such as
doctors, patients, hundreds of different insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and
employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. In addition, billing
process arrangements with third-party administrators, disputes regarding responsible party
and auditing for specific compliance issues further complicate the billing process.

The
Company utilizes a centralized billing system in the collection of substantially all of
its accounts receivable. This system generates bills to customers based on the payer type.
Client billing is typically generated monthly, whereas patient and third party billing are
typically generated on a daily basis. Agings of accounts receivable are then monitored by
billing personnel and re-bills and follow-up

(12)

activities are conducted as
necessary. Bad debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for
doubtful accounts at an appropriate level, based on the Company’s experience with its
accounts receivable. The Company writes off accounts against the allowance for doubtful
accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible. For client billing, accounts are
written off when all reasonable collection efforts prove to be unsuccessful. Patient
accounts are written off after the normal dunning cycle has occurred and the account has
been transferred to a third party collection agency. Third party and managed care accounts
are written off when they exceed the payer’s timely filing limits.

A
portion of the Company’s bad debt expense is the result of non-credit related issues
that slow the billing process, such as missing or incorrect billing information on
requisitions. The Company generally performs the requested tests and returns the test
results regardless of whether billing information is incorrect or incomplete. The Company
subsequently attempts to obtain any missing information or rectify any incorrect billing
information received from the health care provider. The Company believes that this
experience is similar to that of its primary competitors. The Company continues to focus
on a number of process initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of these non-credit
related issues by:

•

reducing the number of requisitions received that are missing certain billing information.
This involves counting the number of clinical requisitions received with missing
information by ordering client, as well as determining what specific information was not
provided. The Company then identifies root causes of why the information was missing and
takes steps to ensure that information is provided in the future. These steps include
re-educating clients as to what information is needed in order for the Company to bill and
collect for the test;

•

installing personal computer based products in client offices and Company locations to
help with the accuracy and completeness of billing information captured on the front-end;
and

•

developing and implementing enhanced eligibility checking to compare information to payer
records before billing.

In
addition to the non-credit issues, another component of the Company’s bad debt
expense is related to accounts receivable from patients. This portion of the
Company’s bad debt expense is from the patient’s unwillingness or inability to
pay. The Company is implementing numerous initiatives to reduce the negative impact of
patient accounts receivable by:

•

collecting payment at the time of service;

•

increasing training for billing personnel to improve collections during phone calls; and

•

reviewing bill design and frequency.

Quality Assurance

The
Company considers the quality of its tests to be of critical importance, and it has
established a comprehensive quality assurance program for all of its laboratories and
other facilities designed to help assure accurate and timely test results. In addition to
the compulsory external inspections and proficiency programs required by CMS and other
regulatory agencies, Company-wide systems and procedures are in place to emphasize and
monitor quality assurance. All of the Company’s regional laboratories are subject to
on-site evaluations, the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) proficiency
testing program, state surveys and the Company’s own internal quality control
programs.

External
Proficiency/Accreditations. The Company participates in numerous externally-administered,
blind quality surveillance programs, including the CAP program. The blind programs
supplement all other quality assurance procedures and give Company management the
opportunity to review its technical and service performance from the client’s
perspective.

Internal
Quality Control. The Company regularly performs internal quality control testing by
running quality control samples with known values at the same time as patient samples
submitted for testing. All quality control sample test results are entered into the
Company’s national laboratory computer, which

(13)

connects the Company’s
facilities nationwide to a common on-line quality control database. This system helps
technologists and technicians check quality control values and requires further prompt
verification if any quality control value is out of range. The Company has an extensive,
internally administered program of blind sample proficiency testing (i.e. the testing
laboratory does not know the sample being tested is a quality control sample). As part of
this program the Company’s locations receive specimens from the Company’s
Quality Assurance and Corporate Technical Services departments for analysis.

The
CAP accreditation program involves both on-site inspections of the laboratory and
participation in CAP’s proficiency testing program for all categories in which the
laboratory is accredited by CAP. CAP is an independent non-governmental organization of
board-certified pathologists which offers an accreditation program to which laboratories
can voluntarily subscribe. CAP has been accredited by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories
to determine adherence to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, and the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 standards. A laboratory’s receipt
of accreditation by CAP satisfies the Medicare requirement for participation in
proficiency testing programs administered by an external source. All of the Company’s
major laboratories are accredited by CAP.

The
Company’s forensic crime laboratory, located at Research Triangle Park, NC, is
accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, Laboratory Accreditation
Board (“ASCLD/LAB”) in the category of DNA testing. Under the Crime Laboratory
Accreditation Program managed by the ASCLD/LAB, a crime laboratory undergoes a
comprehensive and in-depth inspection to demonstrate that its management, operations,
employees, procedures and instruments, physical plant, and security and personnel safety
procedures meet stringent quality standards. The Company is one of 305 ASCLD accredited
crime laboratories worldwide and is one of only 14 private crime laboratories holding the
accreditation. Accreditation is granted for a period of five years provided that a
laboratory continues to meet the standards during that period.

Employees

As
of January 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 24,000 full-time equivalent employees.
Subsidiaries of the Company have three collective bargaining agreements which cover
approximately 700 employees. The Company believes its overall relations with its employees
are good.

Regulation and
Reimbursement

General

The
clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental regulation at the
federal, state and local levels. As described below, these regulations concern licensure
and operation of clinical laboratories, payment for laboratory services, health care fraud
and abuse, security and confidentiality of health information, quality, environmental and
occupational safety.

Regulation of Clinical Laboratories

The
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) extended federal
oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by
the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. CLIA requires that
all clinical laboratories must meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel
standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to
inspections.

Standards
for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the
laboratory, with tests classified as either “high complexity”, “moderate
complexity”, or “waived. ” Laboratories performing high complexity testing
are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories.
Labs performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the Food and Drug
Administration to have a low potential for error and requiring little or no oversight, may
apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA.
All major and many smaller Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high
complexity testing. The Company’s remaining smaller testing sites hold CLIA
certificates to perform moderate complexity testing or a certificate of waiver.

(14)

The
sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or
limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct
business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare
and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The
loss or suspension of a license, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future
changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The
Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a
state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under
federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory
schemes. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications,
specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. For example,
some of the Company’s laboratories are subject to the State of New York’s
clinical laboratory regulations, which contain provisions that are more stringent than
those under federal law.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, and
the Company’s laboratories have continuing programs to ensure that their operations
meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the
Company’s laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.

Payment for Clinical Laboratory Services

In
2005 and 2004, the Company derived approximately 20% of its net sales from tests performed
for beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Company’s
other business depends significantly on continued participation in these programs, and
other government healthcare programs, because clients often want a single laboratory to
perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private
sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing
reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.

Reimbursement
under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory services is subject to a
clinical laboratory fee schedule which sets the maximum amount payable in each Medicare
carrier’s jurisdiction. This clinical laboratory fee schedule is updated annually.
Laboratories bill the program directly and must accept the scheduled amount as payment in
full for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. State Medicaid
programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical
laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.

Payment
under the fee schedule has been limited from year to year by Congressional action,
including imposition of national limitation amounts and freezes on the otherwise
applicable annual Consumer Price Index “CPI” updates. For most diagnostic lab
tests, the national limitation is now 74% of the national median of all local fee
schedules established for each test. Under a provision of the Medicare, Medicaid, and
SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”), the cap is set
at 100% of the median for tests performed after January 1, 2001 that the Secretary
determines are new tests for which no limitation amount has previously been established.

Following
a five year freeze on CPI updates to the clinical lab fee schedule, there was a 1.19%
increase in the fee schedule in 2003. However, in late 2003, the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) again imposed a freeze
in the Consumer Price Index update of the clinical lab fee schedule for 2004 through 2008.

Separate
from clinical diagnostic laboratory services, which generally are reimbursed under the
Medicare laboratory fee schedule, many pathology services are reimbursed under the
Medicare physician fee schedule. The physician fee schedule assigns relative value units
to each procedure or service, and a conversion factor is applied to calculate the
reimbursement. The physician fee schedule also is subject to adjustment on an annual
basis. The formula used to calculate the fee schedule conversion factor resulted in
significant decreases in payment for most physician services in 2003. However, Congress
intervened and the conversion factor was increased for the period March 1, 2003 through
December 31, 2003. Continued decreases were predicted for the next several years, but
Congress again intervened and pursuant to a provision in the MMA, the conversion factor
was increased 1.5% in 2004 and 2005. Facing yet another expected decrease in 2006,
Congress mandated a freeze in the conversion factor so that it remains the same as it was
in 2005, but further increases are expected in future years unless Congress acts

(15)

to change the formula used to
calculate the fee schedule or continues to mandate freezes or increases each year.

The
MMA also included a provision requiring CMS to conduct a demonstration program on using
competitive acquisition for clinical lab tests that are furnished without a face-to-face
encounter between the individual and the entity performing the test, to determine whether
competitive bidding can be used to provide lab services at reduced cost to Medicare while
continuing to maintain quality and access to care. In August 2005, CMS held a forum at
which its proposal for a competitive bidding demonstration project was presented to
representatives of the lab industry, and comments were solicited. Widespread use of
competitive acquisition, if implemented for clinical lab services, could have a
significant effect on the clinical laboratory industry and the Company. In addition, some
States have initiated efforts to establish competitive bidding processes for the provision
of laboratory services under the State Medicaid program.

Because
a significant portion of the Company’s costs are relatively fixed, Medicare, Medicaid
and other government program payment reductions have a direct adverse affect on the
Company’s net earnings and cash flows, but the Company cannot predict whether changes
that will result in such reductions will be implemented.

Congressional
action in 1997 required HHS to adopt uniform coverage, administration and payment policies
for many of the most commonly performed lab tests using a negotiated rulemaking process.
Consensus was reached by the negotiated rulemaking committee which, among other things,
established uniform policies limiting Medicare coverage for certain tests to patients with
specified medical conditions or diagnoses, replacing local Medicare coverage policies,
which varied around the country. Since the final rules generally became effective in 2002,
the use of uniform policies has improved the Company’s ability to obtain necessary
billing information in some cases, but Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code
requirements continue to negatively impact the Company’s ability to be paid for some
of these tests it performs. Due to the range of payers and policies, the extent of this
impact continues to be difficult to quantify.

Future
changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of
current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could
have a material adverse effect on the Company. Based on currently available information,
the Company is unable to predict what type of changes in legislation or regulations, if
any, will occur.

Standard Electronic Transactions, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information

The
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) was
designed to address issues related to the portability of health insurance. In an effort to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the
electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions,
new regulations were promulgated to protect the privacy and security of certain
information. These regulations apply to health plans, health care providers that conduct
standard transactions electronically and health care clearinghouses (“covered
entities”). Five such regulations have been finalized: (i) the Transactions and Code
Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the National Standard
Employer Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique employer identifier in
connection with certain electronic transactions; and (v) the National Provider Identifier
Rule, which requires the use of a unique health care provider identifier in connection
with certain electronic transactions.

The
Company’s HIPAA project plans have two phases: (i) assessment of current systems,
applications, processes and procedure testing and validation for HIPAA compliance and (ii)
remediation of affected systems, applications, processes and procedure testing and
validation for HIPAA compliance.

The
Transactions and Code Sets Rule standardizes the format and data content to be used in the
most common electronic health care transactions, including health care claims,
eligibility, and health care claim status. Its purpose is to encourage the use of
electronic exchanges while reducing the administrative burden associated with using
different formats. The compliance date for this rule was October 16, 2002; however,
covered entities (except small health plans) were permitted to file an extension plan with
HHS to extend the compliance date to October 16, 2003. The extension plan described how
the entity will come into compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets Rule requirements
by the compliance date. The Company and its subsidiaries filed such extension plans. HHS
announced contingency plans

(16)

permitting entities unable to meet
the compliance date to continue to conduct transactions in legacy formats after October
16, 2003. HHS ended the contingency period for electronic claims as of October 1, 2005,
but announced that contingency plans for all other transactions remained in effect. The
Company believes that its claim transactions are compliant, and its contingency plan for
claims has ended. Continuation of the contingency period for the remaining transactions
will be determined by CMS based upon a regular assessment of the readiness of its
electronic “trading partners.” Although the Company believes it is compliant
with respect to other transactions, the Company is operating under its own contingency
plan, pursuant to which it continues to work with payers who are not prepared to meet the
compliance date for those transactions.

The
Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information
(“PHI”) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an
individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the
right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the
use or disclosure of PHI. Additionally, it requires covered entities to implement certain
administrative requirements, such as designating a privacy officer, drafting and
implementing privacy policies and procedures, and training workforce members. Health care
providers governed by the Privacy Rule were required to come into compliance by April 14,
2003.

The
Security Standards establish requirements for safeguarding patient information that is
electronically transmitted or electronically stored. Covered entities were required to be
in compliance with the HIPAA Security Standard as of April 21, 2005. The rule establishes
42 implementation specifications, 20 of which are “required,” meaning they must
be implemented as specified in the rule. Twenty-two are “addressable.” Some of
the Security Standards are technical in nature and some may be addressed through policies
and procedures for using information systems. The Company is in compliance with the HIPAA
Security Standards in all material respects.

In
light of the CMS Guidance and on-going contingency period, the Company believes that it is
in compliance in all material respects with the Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The
Company also believes that it is in compliance with all material provisions of the Privacy
Rule. In this regard, the Company has set up a hotline for the reporting of possible
violations. The total cost associated with the requirements of HIPAA is not expected to be
material to the Company’s operations or cash flows. There are, however, many
unresolved issues in both of these areas and future interpretations of HIPAA could impose
significant costs on the Company.

In
addition to the federal HIPAA regulations described above, there are a number of state
laws regarding the confidentiality of medical information, some of which apply to clinical
laboratories. These laws vary widely, and new laws in this area are pending, but they most
commonly restrict the use and disclosure of medical and financial information. Penalties
for violation of these laws include sanctions against a laboratory’s state licensure,
as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. Violations of the HIPAA provisions after the
applicable compliance dates could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including
significant fines and up to 10 years in prison.

Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations

Existing
federal laws governing federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as
well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse
prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are
interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including
the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS’ Office of the Inspector General
(“OIG”), and various state agencies. Over the last several years, the clinical
laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The
federal government’s enforcement efforts have been increasing, in part as a result of
the enactment of HIPAA, which included several provisions related to fraud and abuse
enforcement, including the establishment of: a program to coordinate federal, state and
local law enforcement programs; a program to conduct greater numbers of investigations,
audits and inspections relating to payment for health care items and services; and a
federal anti-fraud and abuse account for enforcement efforts, funded through collection of
penalties and fines for violations of the health care anti-fraud and abuse laws.

The
federal health care programs antikickback law (the “antikickback law”) prohibits
knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce, the referral of
Medicare or Medicaid (or other federal healthcare program) business. Violations can result
in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or

(17)

exclusion from participation in
federal health care programs. HHS has published “safe harbor” regulations which
specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the antikickback
law if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe
harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the antikickback law; rather, the
arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be
evaluated on a case by case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid antikickback laws
and several states also have antikickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just
federal or state healthcare programs).

From
time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the health
care industry. Several examples of such guidance documents are described below. In October
1994, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on arrangements for the provision of clinical
laboratory services. The Fraud Alert set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in
by some clinical laboratories and health care providers that raise issues under the
“fraud and abuse” laws, including the antikickback law. These practices include:
(i) laboratories providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other
than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of
the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services to renal dialysis
centers at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests which are
billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to a physician’s
managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such
reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous
waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v)
providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not
exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; and (vi) providing free
testing for health care providers, their families and their employees (professional
courtesy testing). The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alert that when one purpose of
an arrangement is to induce referrals of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the
clinical laboratory and the health care provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the
antikickback laws, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Another
issue the OIG is concerned about involves the provision of discounts on laboratory
services billed to customers in return for the referral of more lucrative federal health
care program business. In a 1999 Advisory Opinion, the OIG concluded that a proposed
arrangement whereby a laboratory would offer physicians significant discounts on
non-federal health care program laboratory tests might violate the antikickback act. The
OIG reasoned that the laboratory could be viewed as providing such discounts to the
physician in exchange for referrals by the physician of business to be billed by the
laboratory to Medicare at non-discounted rates. The OIG indicated that the arrangement
would not qualify for protection under the discount safe harbor because Medicare and
Medicaid would not get the benefit of the discount. Similarly, in 1999 correspondence, the
OIG stated that if any direct or indirect link exists between a discount that a laboratory
offers to a skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) for tests covered under the
Medicare Prospective Payment System (“PPS”) and referrals to the laboratory of
tests covered under Medicare Part B (i.e., not covered under a fixed PPS system), then the
antikickback statute would be implicated.

The
OIG also has issued two separate guidance documents regarding joint venture arrangements
that may be viewed as suspect under the antikickback law. These documents have relevance
to clinical laboratories that are part of (or are considering establishing) joint ventures
with potential referral sources. The first guidance document, which focused on investor
referrals to such ventures, was issued in 1989, and the more recent one, concerning
contractual joint ventures, was issued in April 2003. Some of the elements of joint
ventures that the OIG identified as “suspect” include: arrangements in which the
capital invested by the physicians is disproportionately small and the return on
investment is disproportionately large when compared to typical investment; specific
selection of investors who are in a position to make referrals to the venture; and
arrangements in which one of the parties to the joint venture expands into a line of
business that is dependent on referrals from the other party (sometimes called
“shell” joint ventures). In a recent advisory opinion, the OIG expressed concern
about a proposed joint venture in which a laboratory company would assist physician groups
in establishing off-site pathology laboratories. The OIG indicated that the
physicians’ financial and business risk in the venture was minimal and that the
physicians’ would contract out substantially all laboratory operations, committing
very little in the way of financial, capital, or human resources. The OIG was unable to
exclude the possibility that the arrangement was designed to permit the laboratory to pay
the physician groups for their referrals, and therefore was unwilling to find that the
arrangement fell within the safe harbor.

(18)

Violations
of other fraud and abuse laws also can result in exclusion from participation in federal
health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. One basis for such exclusion is an
individual or entity’s submission of claims to Medicare or Medicaid for items or
services that are substantially in excess of that individual or entity’s usual
charges. In September 2003, the OIG issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the
pertinent federal regulations. In this notice OIG proposed to define, for the first time,
the terms “substantially in excess” and “usual charges,” and to
clarify the meaning of “good cause” as an exception to this exclusion authority.
Under the proposed regulation, the Government would determine a provider’s
“usual charges” by looking at the provider’s charges to all customers (with
a few limited exceptions). This could result in the Company (and other laboratory
companies) needing to increase charges to managed care plans and other customers so that
its charges to Medicare are not “substantially in excess” of its “usual
charges.” This notice, which solicited comments, is only a proposal, but if the
regulation were to be amended as proposed, it could have an adverse effect on the Company.
At this time it is impossible to predict whether this proposed change in regulations might
be finalized and how any such final regulations might differ from the notice of proposed
rulemaking.

Under
another federal statute, known as the “Stark” law or “self-referral”
prohibition, physicians who have an investment or compensation relationship with a
clinical laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare patients for
testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties, unless an exception
applies. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or any other party for services
furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. There are several Stark law exceptions that
are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: 1) fair market
value compensation for the provision of items or services; 2) payments by physicians to a
laboratory for clinical laboratory services; 3) an exception for certain ancillary
services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician’s
own office, if various criteria are met; 4) physician investment in a company so long as
the company’s stock is traded on a public exchange and the company has stockholder
equity exceeding $75.0 million; and 5) certain space and equipment rental arrangements
that are set at a fair market value rate and meet other requirements. All of the
requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met in order to take advantage of the
exception. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases
apply to all patient referrals, not just Medicare.

There
are a variety of other types of federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, including
laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Company seeks to conduct
its business in compliance with all federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws. However,
the Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no
assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such
laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in
Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil
fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a federal
healthcare program, or any loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or
state regulatory or enforcement authority, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting
from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Environmental, Health and Safety

The
Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety of
laboratory employees and laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and
disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.
All Company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations
relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens and the Company generally
utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive
requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical
laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the
hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls,
protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other
measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

On
November 6, 2000, Congress passed the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act which
required, among other things, that companies include in their safety programs the
evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective
at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the

(19)

workplace. During 2001, the Company voluntarily implemented the use of safety needles at
          all of its service locations.

Although
the Company is not aware of any current material non-compliance with such federal, state
and local laws and regulations, failure to comply could subject the Company to denial of
the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions.

Drug Testing

Drug
testing for public sector employees is regulated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (“SAMHSA”) (formerly the National Institute on Drug
Abuse), which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories
must meet to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of federal government
contractors and certain other entities. To the extent that the Company’s laboratories
perform such testing, each must be certified as meeting SAMHSA standards. The
Company’s Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Raritan, New Jersey; Houston,
Texas; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington and Southaven, Mississippi laboratories
are SAMHSA certified.

Controlled Substances

The
use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration.

Compliance Program

Because
of evolving interpretations of regulations and the national debate over health care fraud
and abuse, compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other government-established rules
and regulations has become a significant issue throughout the clinical laboratory
industry. The Company has implemented a comprehensive company-wide compliance program. The
objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement, and update
compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing compliance policies
and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to
attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.

In
2001, DIANON settled a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into several of
DIANON’s billing practices. As part of the settlement, DIANON entered into a
voluntary corporate integrity program. As part of DIANON’s acquisition of UroCor
Inc., DIANON assumed responsibility and liability for compliance with UroCor’s
existing corporate integrity agreement.

The
Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and
other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The clinical
laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of
these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no
assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a
prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely effect
the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include
significant fines and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Risks Associated with
our Business

Changes in federal, state, local
and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current
regulations or policies) may adversely affect governmental and third-party reimbursement
for clinical laboratory testing.

Government
payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care
organizations, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery
of health care services. From time to time, Congress has considered and implemented
changes in the Medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. Further
reductions of reimbursement for Medicare services may be implemented from time to time.
Reimbursement for the pathology services component of our business is also subject to
statutory and regulatory reduction. Reductions in the reimbursement rates of other
third-party payers may occur as well. Such changes in the past have resulted in reduced
prices as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical
laboratory industry by adding often more complex new regulatory and administrative
requirements. Further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations
or policies may have a material adverse impact on our business.

We could face significant monetary
damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs if we
violate health care anti-fraud and abuse laws.

We
are subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Our
failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those
relating to billing practices and relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead
to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and
possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of our laboratories. While we believe we
have structured our operations and relationships with care in an effort to meet all
statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might
take a contrary position. Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our
reputation and adversely affect important business relationships we have with third
parties.

Our business would be harmed from
the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future
changes in, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of
1988 or those of Medicare, Medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies.

The
clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these
statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) extend federal oversight to virtually
all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or
by a federally-approved accreditation agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA
requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA
certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or
criminal penalties. In addition, we are subject to regulation under state law. State laws
may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications,
specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records.

We
cannot assure you that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or
applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would
adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and
regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses,
certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional
requirements on us which may be costly.

Failure to comply with
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration Act and the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, which
may result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse
effect upon our business.

We
are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating

(21)

to the protection of the environment
and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling,
transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and
radioactive materials as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees. All of
our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating
to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and we utilize outside vendors for
disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for
health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to
blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These requirements, among
other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training,
medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and
transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention
Act requires, among other things, that we include in our safety programs the evaluation
and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at
reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace.

Failure
to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject us to denial of
the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions
which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with
future legislation could impose additional requirements on us which may be costly.

Regulations requiring the use of
“standard transactions” for health care services issued under HIPAA may
negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.

Pursuant
to HIPAA, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued
final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care
system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and
administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information
exchanged.

HHS
issued guidance on July 24, 2003 stating that it will not penalize a covered entity for
post-implementation date transactions that are not fully compliant with the transactions
standards, if the covered entity can demonstrate its good faith efforts to comply with the
standards. HHS’ stated purpose for this flexible enforcement position was to
“permit health plans to mitigate unintended adverse effects on covered entities’
cash flow and business operations during the transition to the standards, as well as on
the availability and quality of patient care.” However, beginning October 1, 2005,
the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services no longer processes incoming
non-HIPAA-compliant electronic Medicare claims.

The
HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by
payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide
certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to us
by physicians. As a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers
or our inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by
physicians, we could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in
receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. In addition, new
requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments or use of a
national provider identifier, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or
expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable
protocols for claims submissions and with our trade association and an industry coalition
to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards
setting organizations.

Compliance with the HIPAA security
regulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs.

The
HIPAA privacy and security regulations, which became fully effective in April 2003 and
April 2005 respectively, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the
uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers
and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. The
regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:

•

the
circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are
permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient,
including but not limited to treatment

(22)

purposes, activities
to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;

•

a patient's  rights to access,  amend and receive an accounting of certain  disclosures of protected  health
       information;

•

the
content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; and

•

administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that
use or receive protected health information.

We
have implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the HIPAA privacy and
security regulations, as required by law. The privacy regulations establish a
“floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we
are required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying state privacy
laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens
of those countries, we must comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal
privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable
laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment
or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public
policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The
privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for
wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information, including potential civil and
criminal fines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly
provide for a private right of damages, we also could incur damages under state laws to
private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or
other private personal information.

Increased competition, including
price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and
profitability.

The
clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service.
Pricing of laboratory testing services is one of the significant factors often used by
health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. As a result of the
clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical
laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale
automated testing. This consolidation results in greater price competition. We may be
unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net
earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition.

Additional
competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net
revenues and profitability.

Failure to develop, or acquire,
licenses for new or improved testing technologies, or our customers using new technologies
to perform their own tests, may limit our ability to successfully achieve our business
strategy.

The
clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to changing technology and new product
introductions. Our success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other
advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and
improved technologies for early diagnosis on favorable terms. We may not be able to
negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and we cannot be certain that such
arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. If we are unable to
license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may
increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to license new or improved
technologies to expand our esoteric testing businesses, our testing methods may become
outdated when compared with our competition and our testing volume and revenue may be
materially and adversely affected.

In
addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective
point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare
providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of
freestanding clinical laboratories. Development of such technology and its use by our
customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively
impact our revenues.

Currently,
most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as “high” or
“moderate” complexity, and

(23)

thereby is subject to extensive and
costly regulation under CLIA. The cost of compliance with CLIA reduces the cost
effectiveness for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and
other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer
tests to such a laboratory. However, manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits
could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to
physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both
physicians and patients. Diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed
to be “waived” tests under CLIA, which may then be performed in physician office
laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight.
Other tests meeting certain FDA criteria also may be classified as “waived” for
CLIA purposes. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents
and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the
Centers for Disease Control for classifying the complexity of tests for CLIA purposes.
Increased approval of “waived” test kits could lead to increased testing by
physicians in their offices, which could affect our market for laboratory testing services
and negatively impact our revenues.

Changes in payer mix, including an
increase in capitated managed-cost health care or new national or networking managed care
purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and
profitability.

Most
testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person
that ordered the test. In addition, tests ordered by a single physician may be billed to
different payers depending on the medical benefits of a particular patient. Increases in
the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an
adverse impact on our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the percentage
of accessions by payer was:

•

private patients - 2.4%,

•

Medicare, Medicaid and other — 21.3%,

•

commercial clients - 34.8% and

•

managed care — 41.5%.

Managed
care providers typically contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and then
designate the laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating
physicians. The majority of our managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service
basis at a discount from our patient prices. Such discounts have historically resulted in
price erosion and have negatively impacted our operating margins. In addition, managed
care organizations have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of
laboratory testing services for their enrollees. Under a capitated payment contract, the
clinical laboratory and managed care organization agree to a per member, per month payment
to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the
tests actually performed. Such contracts shift the risk of additional testing beyond that
covered by the capitated payment to the clinical laboratory. Pursuant to legislation
passed in late 2003, the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed
care plans is expected to increase. For the year ended December 31, 2005, capitated
contracts accounted for approximately $136.5 million, or 4.1%, of our net sales.

Recently,
managed care companies have announced their intention to adopt new national or networking
managed care laboratory services purchasing models. If we are unable to participate in
these new models, it would have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and
profitability.

In
addition, Medicare and Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to
control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical
laboratory services. Measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical
laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased
test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding
new regulatory and administrative requirements.

We expect efforts to impose reduced
reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to
continue. If we cannot offset additional reductions in the payments we receive for our
services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it
would have a

(24)

material adverse impact on our net
revenues and profitability.

A failure to obtain and retain new
customers and alliance partners, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by
existing customers, could impact our ability to successfully grow our business.

To
offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory
services, we need to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. In addition, a
reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without
offsetting growth in our customer base, could impact our ability to successfully grow our
business and could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.
We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information
systems, our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our
ability to employ qualified personnel. Our failure to successfully compete on any of these
factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in our ability to expand our
customer base.

In
addition, we rely on developing alliances with hospitals to expand our business through
traditional and non-traditional business models. Reference agreements, or the traditional
business model, provide a means for hospitals to outsource patient laboratory testing
services that are esoteric or complex, or that are not time critical. A non-traditional
business model is where we provide technical support services in a variety of health care
settings. Our ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain
current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact our ability
to successfully grow our business.

A failure to integrate newly
acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material
adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.

The
successful integration of any business we may acquire in the future entails numerous
risks, including, among others:

•

loss of key customers or employees;

•

difficulty in consolidating  redundant  facilities and infrastructure  and in standardizing  information and
       other systems;

•

failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have
historically provided;

•

coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and

•

diversion of management’s attention from the day-to-day business of our
company.

We
cannot assure you that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration
efforts will be successful, or that our business will not be adversely affected by any
future acquisitions. Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of
companies or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize the
benefits that we expect to result from such integration, including projected cost savings
within the projected time frame or at all.

Adverse results in material
litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon our business.

Although
we are not currently involved in any material legal actions, we may become subject in the
ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things,
intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as
well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers requesting
comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention
through billing audits or third parties. Legal actions could result in substantial
monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation with customers, which could have a
material adverse effect upon our business.

(25)

An inability to attract and retain
experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.

The
loss of key management personnel or our inability to attract and retain experienced and
qualified skilled employees at our clinical laboratories and research centers could
adversely affect the business. Our success is dependent in part on the efforts of key
members of our management team. Our success in maintaining our leadership position in
genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on our ability to
attract and retain skilled research professionals. In addition, the success of our
clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced
laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform our clinical laboratory
testing services. In the future, if competition for the services of these professionals
increases, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in our
markets. Our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of
professionals terminate their relationship with us or become unable or unwilling to
continue their employment.

Failure to maintain our days sales
outstanding levels would have an adverse effect on our business.

Billing
for laboratory services is a complex process. Laboratories bill many different payers such
as doctors, patients, hundreds of different insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and
employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. We believe that our bad
debt expense, which was 5.3% of our net revenues at December 31, 2005, is the result of
non-credit related issues which slow the billing process and patients who are unable or
unwilling to pay. If we are unable to maintain our days sales outstanding level
(“DSO”), which as of December 31, 2005 was approximately 54 days, our bad debt
expense and DSO could increase, which would have an adverse effect on our business.

Failure in our information
technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing
processes and otherwise disrupt our operations.

Our
laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of
our information technology systems. Despite network security measures and other
precautions we have taken, our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable
to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. In
addition, we are in the process of integrating the information technology systems of our
recently acquired subsidiaries, and we may experience system failures or interruptions as
a result of this process. Sustained system failures or interruption of our systems in one
or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory
requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the
appropriate party. Failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect
our business, profitability and financial condition.

Operations may be disrupted and
adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes,
or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities.

Our
operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as
hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events
may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing
services. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport
specimens, our ability to utilize certain laboratories or to receive material from our
suppliers.

Failure to comply with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404 of that Act which requires management to
report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report
on, our internal controls, could cause sanctions and investigations by regulatory
authorities, such as the SEC.

If
we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely
manner, our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or
investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be an
adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability
of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in connection
with continued testing and strengthening of our internal control system.

All
of the Company’s primary laboratory facilities have been built or improved for the
single purpose of providing clinical laboratory testing services. The Company believes
that these facilities are suitable and adequate and have sufficient production capacity
for its currently foreseeable level of operations. The Company believes that if it were
unable to renew a lease or if a lease were to be terminated on any of the facilities it
presently leases, it could find alternate space at competitive market rates and readily
relocate its operations to such new locations without material disruption to its
operations.

(27)

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On
June 24, 2003, the Company and certain of its executive officers were sued in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in the first of a series
of putative shareholder class actions alleging securities fraud. Shortly thereafter, five
other complaints containing substantially identical allegations were filed against the
Company and certain of the Company’s executive officers. Each of the complaints
alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material
misstatements and/or omissions that caused the price of the Company’s stock to be
artificially inflated between February 13 and October 3, 2002. The plaintiffs seek
certification of a class of substantially all persons who purchased shares of the
Company’s stock during that time period and unspecified monetary damages. These six
cases have been consolidated and will proceed as a single case. The plaintiffs have filed
a consolidated amended complaint. On July 16, 2004, the defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the consolidated complaint. The defendants deny any liability and continue to
defend the case vigorously. At this time, it is premature to make any assessment of the
potential outcome of the cases or whether they could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition.

The
Company is the appellant in a patent case originally filed by Competitive Technologies,
Inc. and Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment against the
Company for patent infringement, with total damages and attorney’s fees payable by
the Company of approximately $7.8 million. The underlying judgment has been paid. The
Company vigorously contested the judgment and appealed the case to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 8, 2004, that court affirmed the judgment
against the Company and, on August 5, 2004, the Company’s request for rehearing was
denied. On November 3, 2004, the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with
the United States Supreme Court. On October 31, 2005, the Court granted the Company’s
petition, and the case is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on March 21,
2006.

The
Company is also involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. These matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property
disputes, professional liability, employee related matters, and inquiries from
governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid payers and managed care payers requesting
comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention
through billing audits or third parties. In the opinion of management, based upon the
advice of counsel and consideration of all facts available at this time, the ultimate
disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. The Company is also
named from time to time in suits brought under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims
Act. These suits typically allege that the Company has made false statements and/or
certifications in connection with claims for payment from federal health care programs.
They may remain under seal (hence, unknown to the Company) for some time while the
government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Such claims
are an inevitable part of doing business in the health care field today and, in the
opinion of management, based upon the advice of counsel and consideration of all facts
available at this time, the ultimate disposition of those qui tam matters presently known
to the Company is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes,
regulations and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The
clinical laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the
courts have not interpreted many of these statutes and regulations. There can be no
assurance therefore that those applicable statutes and regulations might not be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner
that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these
statutes and regulations include significant fines and the loss of various licenses,
certificates and authorizations.

Under
the Company’s present insurance programs, coverage is obtained for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company is
responsible for the uninsured portion of losses related primarily to general, professional
and vehicle liability, certain medical costs and workers’ compensation. The
self-insured retentions are on a per occurrence basis without any aggregate annual limit.
Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon the
Company’s estimates of the aggregated liability of claims incurred. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the

(28)

Company had provided letters of
credit aggregating approximately $62.6 million and $63.5 million respectively, primarily
in connection with certain insurance programs.

(a)    
          During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company began to implement its
          plan related to the integration of Esoterix and US LABS operations into the
          Company’s service delivery network. The plan is directed at reducing
          redundant facilities, while maintaining the goal of providing excellent customer
          service. In connection with the integration plan, the Company recorded $11.9
          million of costs associated with the execution of the plan. The majority of
          these integration costs related to employee severance and contractual
          obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment. Of this amount,
          $10.1 million related to employee severance benefits for approximately 700
          employees, with the remainder primarily related to contractual obligations
          associated with leased facilities. Employee groups being affected as a result of
          this plan included those involved in the collection and testing of specimens, as
          well as administrative and other support functions.

The
Company also recorded a special charge of $5.0 million related to forgiveness of amounts
owed by patients and clients as well as other costs associated with the areas of the Gulf
Coast severely impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

(b)    
          On January 17, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
          outstanding shares of DIANON Systems, Inc. for $47.50 per share in cash, or
          approximately $595.6 million including transaction fees and expenses. The
          Company recorded net restructuring and other special charges of $1.5 million for
          2003 in connection with the integrations of its recent acquisitions.

(32)

(c)    
          On July 25, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
          outstanding stock of Dynacare Inc. in a combination cash and stock transaction
          with a combined value of approximately $496.4 million, including transaction
          costs. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded restructuring and
          other special charges totaling $17.5 million. These charges included a special
          bad debt provision of approximately $15.0 million related to the acquired
          Dynacare accounts receivable balance and restructuring expense of approximately
          $2.5 million relating to Dynacare integration costs of actions that impact the
          Company’s existing employees and operations.

(d)    
          Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. This
          Standard requires that goodwill and other intangibles that are acquired in
          business combinations and that have indefinite useful lives are not to be
          amortized.

(e)    
          During the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a loss of $5.5 million
          relating to the write-off of unamortized bank fees associated with the
          Company’s term debt, which was repaid in September of 2001. The Company
          also recorded a charge of $8.9 million as a result of a payment made to a bank
          to terminate an interest rate swap agreement tied to the Company’s term
          loan.

(f)    
          Long-term obligations primarily includes the zero coupon convertible
          subordinated notes, the 5 1/2% senior notes due 2013, the 5 5/8% senior notes
          due 2015 and other long-term obligations. The accreted balance of the zero
          coupon subordinated notes was $544.4 million, $533.7 million, $523.2 million,
          and $512.9 million, and $502.8 million, at December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002
          and 2001, respectively. The balance of the 5

1/2% senior notes,
          including principal and unamortized portion of a deferred gain on an interest
          rate swap agreement, was $353.0 million, $353.4 million, $353.8 million, $0, and
          $0, at December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The
          principal balance of the 5 5/8% senior notes was $250.0 million at December 31,
          2005 and $0 for all other years presented. The remainder of other long-term
          obligations consisted primarily of mortgages payable with balances of $1.5
          million, $2.2 million, $2.5 million, $3.1 million, and $0.3 million, at December
          31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Long-term obligations
          exclude amounts due to affiliates.

Item 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

During
2005, the Company continued to strengthen its financial performance through the
implementation of the Company’s strategic plan and the expansion of its national
platform in routine testing. This plan continues to provide growth opportunities for the
Company by building a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing
technologies primarily through internal development efforts, acquisitions and technology
licensing activities.

The
Company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors: 1) The
expansion of higher-value genomic tests such as Cystic Fibrosis, HCV and HIV genotyping,
along with the continued growth of HIV viral load and HPV testing; 2) Transition to
Cytyc’s ThinPrep Imaging System; 3) Continued progress with existing licensing and
business relationships (such as EXACT Sciences, Atherotech, Liposcience, and
BioPredictive); 4) The Company’s ongoing business acquisition strategy; and 5)
Growing demand for genomic testing creating a positive shift in test mix toward higher
value testing.

Continued Development of Genomic, Esoteric, and Anatomic Pathology Services

The
Company’s acquisitions of Dianon, US LABS, and Esoterix position the Company as the
leading provider of cancer and specialty testing in the United States. At the end of
December approximately 35 percent of the Company’s revenues are in the genomic,
esoteric, and anatomic pathology categories. Prior to the acquisition of Dianon, only 27
percent of the Company’s revenues were derived from these testing categories.

In
addition to greater revenue and earnings potential, these acquisitions provide the Company
the opportunity to reassess the cost structure of our entire organization to eliminate any
redundant functions and costs wherever they may exist. The Company’s third quarter
restructuring marks the beginning of the implementation of these integration efforts. In
connection with these acquisitions, the Company expects to ultimately achieve cost
reductions of approximately thirty million dollars on a pre-tax basis over time compared
to the current run-rate.

Cytyc ThinPrep Imaging System

The
acceptance of the Cytyc ThinPrep Imaging System continues to accelerate as more physicians
become aware of this service and the benefits that it provides to them and to their
patients. This new service offers both enhanced quality to clients and their patients as
well as enhanced efficiency to the Company’s labs. By the end of the fourth quarter,
the ThinPrep Imaging System was being requested for approximately 31 percent of all
liquid-based Pap smears ordered, up from approximately 5 percent at the end of the first
quarter. On an annualized run-rate basis, this means that the Company is now performing
approximately 2.3 million imaged guided Pap tests. This significant adoption rate clearly
indicates that physicians recognize the benefits of this Pap screening technology
advancement.

Managed Care

The
Company’s growth is fueled not only by the introduction of new testing capabilities,
but also by expanding and strengthening relationships with managed care partners. A major
driver of volume growth this year is a result of managed care relationships.

Effective
October 1, 2005, the Company was awarded the exclusive national provider contract for
WellPoint’s PPO in the entire state of Georgia. Additionally, the Company was awarded
the exclusive national lab provider contract for the Wellpoint HMO and PPO fee for service
plans in Nevada effective October 15, 2005.

(34)

During
2005, the Company continued to strengthen relationships with its national managed care
partners through three major initiatives.

•

First, by helping managed care companies understand how the Company can help reduce their
overall laboratory spending while still allowing for fair payment for the services that
the Company provides. Control of “leakage” – the amount of work performed
and billed by non-contracted providers – remains a major area of cost reduction
opportunity for managed care companies.

•

Second, by providing managed care companies with unique scientific capabilities both in
traditional clinical and anatomic pathology services, and in break-through areas such as
wellness.

•

Third, by bringing unique connectivity and information aggregation and analysis solutions
to our managed care partners.

Seasonality

The
majority of the Company’s testing volume is dependent on patient visits to
doctor’s offices and other providers of health care. Volume of testing generally
declines during the year-end holiday periods and other major holidays. In addition, volume
declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows. Therefore,
comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or
results for the full year.

The
increase in net sales for the three years ended December 31, 2005 has been driven
primarily by the Company’s continued shift in test mix to higher priced genomic and
esoteric tests. As a percentage of total net sales, genomic and esoteric tests have
increased during the three year period ended December 31, 2005 from 30.2% in 2003 to 34.0%
in 2005. The acquisitions of US Labs and Esoterix in 2005 will continue to build on the
Company’s leadership position in the genomic and esoteric market. In addition to a
shift in test mix, net sales were positively impacted in 2005 by improved pricing in
routine testing. The improvement in routine test pricing was the result of several factors
including our emphasis on pricing discipline and the loss of a large capitated contract in
Florida and a large hospital laboratory agreement.

years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. The decrease in the bad debt
expense rate is the result of improved billing and collection performance. Other SG&A
remained relatively flat in 2004 and increased significantly in 2005 as the Company began
the integration of the Esoterix and US LABS acquisitions. The Company recorded $11.9
million in restructuring charges during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 in
connection with the integration process and expects to ultimately realize savings of
approximately thirty million dollars on a pre-tax basis over time compared to the current
run-rate. Selling, general and administrative expenses have also increased due to the
Company’s investment in the sales force.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded certain adjustments to previously
recorded restructuring charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of
approximately of $0.9 million. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a
pre-tax restructuring charge of $3.3 million in connection with the integration of DIANON.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $3.1 million, relating
to the continuing integration of its recent acquisitions. The Company also recorded
certain adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2003 to previously recorded restructuring
charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of approximately $4.9 million.

Liquidity, Capital
Resources and Financial Position

The
Company’s strong cash-generating capability and financial condition provide ready
access to capital markets. The Company’s principal source of liquidity is operating
cash flow. This cash-generating capability is one of the Company’s fundamental
strengths and provides substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating, investing
and financing needs. In addition, the Company has revolving credit facilities that are
further discussed in “Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Operating Activities

In
2005, the Company’s operations provided $574.2 million of cash, primarily reflecting
the Company’s solid business results, offset by net tax payments of $233.3 million
and pension plan contributions of $8.0 million. The growth in the Company’s cash flow
from operations primarily resulted from improved earnings and the expansion of the
business through acquisitions. The Company continued to focus on efforts to increase cash
collections from all payers, as well as on-going improvements to the claim submission
processes.

During
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company made contributions to its defined pension plan in the
amounts of $8.0 million, $60.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The Company
expects to contribute $8.0 million to its defined benefit pension plan during 2006. See
“Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further discussion of
the Company’s pension and postretirement plans.

Investing Activities

Capital
expenditures were $93.6 million, $95.0 million and $83.6 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $100.0 to $115.0
million in 2006. The Company will continue to make important investments in information
technology connectivity with its customers and financial systems. Such expenditures are
expected to be funded by cash flow from operations as well as borrowings under the
Company’s revolving credit facilities.

The
Company has invested a total of $28.3 million over the past three years in new testing
technologies and had $60.5 million net book value of capitalized patents, licenses and
technology at December 31, 2005. While the Company continues to believe its strategy of
entering into licensing and technology distribution agreements with the developers of
leading-edge technologies will provide future growth in revenues, there are certain risks
associated with these investments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk
that the licensed technology will not gain broad acceptance in the marketplace; or that
insurance companies, managed care organizations, or Medicare and Medicaid will not approve
reimbursement for these tests at a level commensurate with the costs of running the tests.
Any or all of these circumstances could result in impairment in the value of the related
capitalized licensing costs.

Financing Activities

During
2005, the Company repurchased $588.7 million of stock representing 11.6 million shares. As
of December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding authorizations to purchase approximately
$285.2 million.

Holders
of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a
portion of their notes on September 11, 2006 and 2011 at prices of $741.92 to $819.54 per
note, respectively. Should the holders put the notes to the Company on any of the dates
above, the Company believes that it will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation
with cash on hand, borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and additional financing
if necessary.

Credit Ratings

The
Company’s debt ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB from Standard and
Poor’s contribute to our ability to access capital markets.

Contractual Cash
Obligations

(a)

Contingent future licensing payments will be made if certain events take place,
               such as the launch of a specific test, the transfer of certain technology, and
               when specified revenue milestones are met.

(b)

Holders of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may require the Company to
               purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2006 and 2011
               at $741.92 and $819.54 per note, respectively. Should the holders put the notes
               to the Company on any of the dates above, the Company believes that it will be
               able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand, borrowings on the
               revolving credit facility, and additional financing if necessary.

(c)

The table does not include obligations under the Company’s pension and
               postretirement benefit plans which are included in “Note 14 to Consolidated
               Financial Statements.” The Company expects to contribute approximately $8
               million to its defined pension plan during 2006, although it is not legally
               required to do so. Benefits under the Company’s postretirement medical plan
               are made when claims are submitted for payment, the timing of which are not
               practicable to estimate.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

The
Company does not have transactions or relationships with “special purpose”
entities, and the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal
operating leases.

On
December 7, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a
bank for the acquisition of 4.8 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common
stock for an initial purchase price of $52.04 per share. Pursuant to the agreement
with the bank, the bank will purchase 4.8 million shares in the open market over a period
ending no later than June 13, 2006. At the end of the purchase period, the Company
will either receive from or pay to the bank a price adjustment based on the volume
weighted average purchase price of the shares acquired compared to the initial purchase
price. Such price adjustment can be either in cash or common stock at the discretion
of the Company. The Company has limited its potential financial exposure in the event
of an increase in its share price above a cap during the purchase period with respect to
2.4 million of the repurchased shares. At December 31, 2005, the price adjustment
would have required the Company to pay $5.3 million in cash or common stock.

Other Commercial
Commitments

At
December 31, 2005, the Company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $62.6
million, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. These letters of credit
are secured by the Company’s senior credit facilities and are renewed annually,
around mid-year.

Based
on current and projected levels of operations, coupled with availability under its new
senior credit facilities, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both
its short-term and long-term cash needs.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In
December 2004 the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued FAS 123(R),
Share-Based Payment (revised 2004). This Statement is a revision of FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This Statement supersedes APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance.
This Statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses
transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that
are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled
by the issuance of those equity instruments. The Company currently estimates the adoption
to impact net income by approximately $15.0, net of tax. This Statement focuses primarily
on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based
payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for
share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in Statement
123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments
That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services.” This Statement does not address the accounting for employee share
ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, Employers’
Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans.

In
March, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This Interpretation
clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement
No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to
perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The
obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though
uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Thus, the timing and
(or) method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement
obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value
of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when
incurred—generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and (or) through
the normal operation of the asset. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of
settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the
measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Statement 143
acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information may not be available to reasonably
estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This Interpretation also
clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair
value of an asset retirement obligation. This Interpretation is effective no later than
the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect that
this standard will impact its financial position or results of operations.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections”, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2005. This
statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20 “Accounting Changes” (APB 20) and SFAS No.
3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements”. APB 20
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by
including, in net income of the period of the change, the cumulative effect of changing to
the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior
periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of
the change. The Company does not expect that this standard will impact its financial
position or results of operations.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets. This Statement
amends the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. That
statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be
measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion,
however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion 29
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and
replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash
flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The
Company has not historically entered into a significant level of nonmonetary transactions
and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or
results unless nonmonetary transactions are

(41)

utilized in the future. This
statement is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported periods. The Company’s critical accounting policies arise in
conjunction with the following:

•

Allowances for doubtful accounts

•

Pension expense

•

Accruals for self insurance reserves

•

Income tax expense

Allowance for doubtful
accounts

Revenue
is recognized for services rendered when test results are reported to the ordering
physician and the testing process is complete. The Company’s sales are generally
billed to three types of payers – clients, patients and third parties, such as
managed care companies, Medicare and Medicaid. For clients, sales are recorded on a
fee-for-service basis at the Company’s client list price, less any negotiated
discount. Patient sales are recorded at the Company’s patient fee schedule, net of
any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. The Company bills
third party payers in two ways – fee-for-service and capitated agreements.
Fee-for-service third party payers are billed at the Company’s patient fee schedule
amount, and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. These discounts
are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is
maintained for each third party payer. The majority of the Company’s third party
sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale. For the
remaining third party sales, estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer.
Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection
and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue. These adjustments are not
material to the Company’s results of operations in any period presented. The Company
periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends.
Under capitated agreements with managed care companies, the Company recognizes revenue
based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan
regardless of the number or costs of services performed.

The
Company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables
based on the period of time they have been outstanding. Bad debt expense is recorded
within selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered
necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level. The
Company’s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful
accounts involves judgment, and considers such factors as the age of the underlying
receivables, historical and projected collection experience, and other external factors
that could affect the collectibility of its receivables. Accounts are written off against
the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s write off policy (e.g.
when they are deemed to be uncollectible). In the determination of the appropriate level
of the allowance, accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of
cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the Company’s
receivables. These collection and reserve processes, along with the close monitoring of
the billing process, help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates
resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience.

Pension Expense

Substantially
all employees of the Company are covered by a defined benefit retirement plan (the
“Company Plan”). The benefits to be paid under the Company Plan are based on
years of credited service and compensation earned while an employee of LabCorp. The
Company has a second defined benefit plan which covers its senior management group and
provides for additional benefits, due in part to limitations on benefits and pay imposed
on the Company Plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

The
Company’s net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these
valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan
assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. The Company is
required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in
making these assumptions. Changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes
in these assumptions. The key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plans
were a 5.6% discount rate and an 8.5% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets as
of December 31, 2005.

Discount Rate

The
Company works with its independent actuary to develop a discount rate assumption used to
value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. The Company follows paragraph 186
of Financial Accounting Standard 106 in developing this rate. The Company’s actuary
obtains information on high-quality corporate (AA rating or higher) bonds from a
nationally recognized credit rating agency. These bonds are then reviewed and outliers are
discarded. The results of the actuary’s discount rate analysis are then reviewed by
the Company and a final decision on the discount rate assumption is made by the Company. A
one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in
2005 pension expense of $3.4 million.

Return on Plan Assets

In
establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the Company reviews its asset
allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for
plan operating expenses. Actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns
will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. The change in the unrecognized loss
will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. A one percentage point increase in the
expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in 2005 pension expense
of $2.5 million.

Current
year net pension cost was $9.8 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from 2004. Our
actuaries have estimated that 2006 net pension cost will be higher by approximately $4.8
million than 2005 net pension cost. The decrease in the discount rate assumption during
fiscal 2005 is a primary reason for this expected increase in net pension cost for 2006.

Further
information on our defined benefit retirement plan is provided in note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements.

(43)

Accruals for
Self-insurance Reserves

Accruals
for self-insurance reserves (including workers’ compensation, auto and employee
medical) are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history, along with
current and estimated future economic conditions.

The Company is self-insured for professional liability claims arising in
the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of
laboratory test results. The Company records an accrual for such claims payable and claims
incurred but not reported based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by
frequency and amounts of claims, which is performed at least annually.

While
management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very
nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from these estimates. The Company’s Audit Committee periodically
reviews the Company’s significant accounting policies. See “Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of significant accounting
policies.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this
method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax
benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not.

(44)

Company has made in this report, and from time to time may otherwise make in its public
filings, press releases and discussions by Company management, forward-looking statements

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The
Company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated
with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has
included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate
swap agreements. Although, as set forth below, the Company’s zero coupon-subordinated
notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The
Company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The
Company’s zero coupon-subordinated notes contain the following two features that are
considered to be embedded derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133:

1)

The Company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon-subordinated
               notes after September 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals
               120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and
               contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period.

2)

Holders may surrender zero coupon-subordinated notes for conversion during any
               period in which the rating assigned to the zero coupon-subordinated notes by
               Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services is BB- or lower.

Based
upon independent appraisals, these embedded derivatives had no fair market value at
December 31, 2005.

Borrowings
under the Company’s revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates,
unless fixed through interest rate swap or other agreements.

Two
of the Company’s joint venture partnerships operate in Canada and remit the
Company’s share of partnership income in Canadian Dollars. Accordingly, the cash flow
received from these affiliates is subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange
risk.

The
amount of the price adjustment as required by the overnight share repurchase agreement is
subject to changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the COSO, the Company’s
management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2005.

The
Company management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein with its report immediately preceding our audited
financial statements.

Additionally,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determined that
there have been no significant changes to the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the last fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings:

We have completed integrated audits
of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings’ 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions,
based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

(F-2)

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Financial
Statement Presentation:

Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings with its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is the
second largest independent clinical laboratory company in the United States based on 2005
net revenues. Through a national network of laboratories, the Company offers a broad range
of testing services used by the medical profession in routine testing, patient diagnosis,
and in the monitoring and treatment of disease. In addition, the Company has developed
specialty and niche businesses based on certain types of specialized testing capabilities
and client requirements, such as oncology testing, HIV genotyping and phenotyping,
diagnostic genetics and clinical research trials.

Since
its founding in 1971, the Company has grown into a network of 36 primary laboratories and
over 1,300 service sites consisting of branches, patient service centers and STAT
laboratories. With approximately 24,000 employees, the Company processes tests on more
than 360,000 patient specimens daily and provides clinical laboratory testing services in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Belgium and three provinces in
Canada. The Company operates in one business segment.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries for which it exercises control. Long-term investments in
affiliated companies in which the Company owns greater than 20%, and therefore exercises
significant influence, but which it does not control, are accounted for using the equity
method. Investments in which the Company does not exercise significant influence
(generally, when the Company has an investment of less than 20% and no representation on
the Company’s Board of Directors) are accounted for using the cost method. All
significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company does
not have any variable interest entities or special purpose entities.

The
financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at
exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting translation
adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive earnings”.

Financial Statement
Revision

Certain
prior year amounts have been revised to present auction rate securities (ARS) and variable
rate demand notes (VRDN) as short-term investments instead of cash and equivalents. The
Company has revised its consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2004
and its consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003. As a result, the Company’s investments in ARS and VRDN in the amount of $139.2
at December 31, 2004, which had previously been included in cash and cash equivalents, are presented as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2004. In addition, the aggregate purchases and proceeds from the sale of
these securities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 should have been presented
in the consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities for those years.
These revisions had no impact on the Company’s results of operations, changes in
shareholders’ equity, or cash flows from operating activities and financing
activities.

ARS
and VRDN do not meet the definition of a cash equivalent as defined in SFAS No. 95,
“Statement of Cash Flows” (“SFAS 95”) as such securities have maturity
dates greater than 90 days. ARS and VRDN are variable bonds tied to short-term interest
rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days. ARS and VRDN
have interest rate resets through a modified Dutch auction, at predetermined short-term
intervals, usually every 1, 7, or 35 days. The Company had historically classified ARS and
VRDN as cash and cash equivalents if the period between the interest rate resets was 90
days or less, which was based on the Company’s ability to either liquidate its
holdings or roll its investments over to the next reset period. The Company reevaluated
the classification of these investments considering the maturity dates associated with the
underlying bonds. The effects of this revision are summarized in the table below.

As

Revenue Recognition:

Sales
are recognized on the accrual basis at the time test results are reported, which
approximates when services are provided. Services are provided to certain patients covered
by various third-party payer programs including various Managed Care organizations, as
well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Billings for services under third-party payer
programs are included in sales net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances
for differences between the amounts billed and estimated program payment amounts.
Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the programs
are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to revenue. In 2005, 2004 and 2003,
approximately 20%, 20%, and 19%, respectively of the Company’s revenues were
derived

from tests performed for the beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. The Company has capitated agreements with certain managed care customers and
recognizes related revenue based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each
member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by
the Company. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 4% of the Company’s revenues were
derived

from these capitated agreements.

Use of Estimates:

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported periods. Significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful
accounts, deferred tax assets, fair values and amortization lives for intangible assets
and accruals for self-insurance reserves and pensions. The allowance for doubtful accounts
is determined based on historical collection trends, the aging of accounts, current
economic conditions and regulatory changes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Concentration of Credit
Risk:

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. The
total cash balances on deposit that exceeded the balances insured by the F.D.I.C., were
approximately $44.5 at December 31, 2005. Cash equivalents at December 31, 2005, totaled
$39.4, which includes amounts invested in treasury bills and short-term bonds.

OF AMERICA HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

Substantially
all of the Company’s accounts receivable are with companies and individuals in the
health care industry. However, concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the number
of the Company’s clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic
regions.

Accounts
receivable balances (gross) from Medicare and Medicaid were $105.4 and $107.9 at December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Earnings per Share:

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings, less preferred stock dividends
and accretion, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings including the impact of dilutive
adjustments by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially
dilutive shares, as if they had been issued at the beginning of the period presented.
Potentially dilutive common shares result primarily from the Company’s outstanding
stock options, restricted stock awards, performance share awards, and shares issuable upon
conversion of zero-coupon subordinated notes.

The
following represents a reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per
share: (shares in millions)

The
following table summarizes the potential common shares not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because their impact would have been antidilutive:

Stock Compensation Plans:

The
Company accounts for its employee stock option plans using the intrinsic method under APB
Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations. Accordingly, compensation for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at
the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The
Company’s employee stock purchase plan is also accounted for under APB Opinion No. 25
and is treated as non-compensatory.

The
Company applies the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its employee stock
option and stock purchase plans and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for these plans in the financial statements. Compensation cost for restricted stock awards
is recorded by allocating their aggregate grant date fair value over their vesting period.
Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value method as defined in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” as amended by SFAS No. 148

“

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123"

,

the impact on the Company’s net earnings on a pro
forma basis is indicated below:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except

See
note 13 for assumptions used in calculating pro forma compensation expense for the
employee stock option and stock purchase plans.

The
Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified prospective method on January 1,
2006 and currently estimates the adoption to impact net income for fiscal 2006 based on
current volatility and forfeiture assumptions by approximately $15.0, net of tax. SFAS No.
123(R) eliminates the intrinsic value measurement method of accounting for services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments and requires the measurement of
such services to be based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The
standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option-pricing
model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price, if such
a price exists. Such costs must be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award. The standard also requires
estimating the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued, rather than
accounting for forfeitures as they occur. SFAS No. 123(R) permits companies to adopt its
requirements using either a “modified prospective” method, or a “modified
retrospective” method. Under the “modified prospective” method,
compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective
date, based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted
after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all unvested awards
granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R). Under the “modified
retrospective” method, the requirements are the same as under the “modified
prospective” method, but such method also permits entities to restate financial
statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS
No. 123(R).

Cash Equivalents:

Cash
equivalents (primarily investments in money market funds, time deposits, commercial paper
and Eurodollars which have original maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase) are carried at cost which approximates market.

Short-Term Investments:

The
items classified as short-term investments are principally ARS, VRDN, and U.S. Government
Agency securities. The Company classifies the ARS and VRDN as available-for-sale.
Securities accounted for as available-for-sale are required to be reported at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, excluded from net income and shown
separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within
shareholders’ equity.  The securities that the Company has classified as
available-for-sale generally trade at par and as a result typically do not have any
realized or unrealized gains or losses. No gains or losses were realized on sales of ARS
and VRDN for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. As of December 31, 2005,
there are no unrealized holding gains or losses on these securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

The
U.S. Government Agency securities with original maturities between six and twelve months
are carried at cost which approximates market. It is the intent of the Company to hold
these investments until they mature or are called by the issuer.

Inventories:

Inventories,
consisting primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of properties held under capital leases
is equal to the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair
value of the leased property at the inception of the lease. Depreciation and amortization
expense is computed on all classes of assets based on their estimated useful lives, as
indicated below, using principally the straight-line method.

Years

Buildings and building improvements


Machinery and equipment

3-10

Furniture and fixtures

5-10

Leasehold
improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated lives or the term of the related leases. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Retirements, sales and other disposals
of assets are recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation from the related
accounts with any resulting gain or loss reflected in operations.

Capitalized Software
Costs:

The Company capitalizes purchased software which is ready for service and capitalizes
software development costs incurred on significant projects starting from the time that
the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to funding a project
until the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended
use. Capitalized costs include direct material and service costs and payroll and
payroll-related costs. Research and development costs and other computer software
maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred. Capitalized
software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the underlying system, generally five years.

Long-Lived Assets:

Goodwill
is evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis and
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be
impaired.

Long-lived
assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is determined by the Company at the level for which there are
identifiable cash flows by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future
undiscounted net cash flows before interest expense and income taxes expected to be
generated by the assets. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets (based on market prices
in an active market or on discounted cash flows). Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.

The
Company completed an annual impairment analysis of its indefinite lived assets, including
goodwill, and has found no instances of impairment as of December 31, 2005.

Intangible Assets:

Prior
to July 1, 2001, the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets
acquired was recorded as goodwill and amortized on the straight-line basis ranging from 20
to 40 years. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets”. This

(F-12)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

standard requires that goodwill and
other intangibles that are acquired in business combinations and that have indefinite
useful lives are not to be amortized and are to be reviewed for impairment annually based
on an assessment of fair value. Other intangibles (patents and technology, customer lists
and non-compete agreements), are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, such as legal life for patents and technology, 10 to 25 years for
customer lists and contractual lives for non-compete agreements.

Debt Issuance Costs:

The
costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense
using the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt.

Professional Liability:

The
Company is self-insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of
business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. The
Company records a reserve for such asserted and estimated unasserted claims based on
actuarial assessments of future settlement and legal defense costs.

Income Taxes:

The
Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this
method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax
benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not.

Derivative Financial
Instruments:

Interest
rate swap agreements, which have been used by the Company from time to time in the
management of interest rate exposure, are accounted for at fair value. Amounts to be paid
or received under such agreements are recognized as interest income or expense in the
periods in which they accrue.

The
Company’s zero coupon-subordinated notes contain the following two features that are
considered to be embedded derivative instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”:

1)

The Company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon subordinated
               notes after September 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals
               120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and
               contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period.

2)

Holders may surrender zero coupon-subordinated notes for conversion during any
               period in which the rating assigned to the zero coupon-subordinated notes by
               Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services is BB- or lower.

Based
upon independent appraisals, these embedded derivatives had no fair market value at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments:

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, income taxes receivable, senior notes and accounts payable are considered to
be representative of their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair
market value of the zero coupon-subordinated notes, based on market pricing, was
approximately $567.3 and $501.3 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

with the current year presentation.

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

On
February 3, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Pathology Labs,
Inc. and Subsidiaries (“US LABS”) for approximately $155 in cash. US LABS, based
in Irvine, California, is a national, anatomic pathology reference laboratory devoted to
comprehensive, high-quality, rapid-response cancer testing. The company provides
diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive cancer testing services to hospitals, physician
offices and surgery centers.

On
May 11, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Esoterix, Inc. and
Subsidiaries (“Esoterix”) for approximately $150 in cash. Esoterix, based in
Austin, Texas, is a leading provider of specialty reference testing.

3. RESTRUCTURING AND
OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES

During
the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company began to implement its plan related to
the integration of Esoterix and US LABS operations into the Company’s service
delivery network. The plan is directed at reducing redundant facilities, while maintaining
the goal of providing excellent customer service. In connection with the integration plan,
the Company recorded $11.9 of costs associated with the execution of the plan. The
majority of these integration costs related to employee severance and contractual
obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment. Of this amount, $10.1 million
related to employee severance benefits for approximately 700 employees, with the remainder
primarily related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities. Employee
groups being affected as a result of this plan included those involved in the collection
and testing of specimens, as well as administrative and other support functions. As of
December 31, 2005, the balance of accrued liabilities related to these integration
activities was $3.1 and is expected to be paid in 2006.

The
Company also recorded a special charge of $5.0 million related to forgiveness of amounts
owed by patients and clients as well as other costs associated with the areas of the Gulf
Coast severely impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

the Company does not have control of these three partnerships, due to the participating
rights afforded to all partners in each agreement. The Company has no material obligations
or guarantees to, or in support of, these unconsolidated joint ventures and their
operations.

Arrangers, and a group of

(F-16)

LABORATORY CORPORATION

(Dollars in millions, except

financial institutions for borrowings of up to $350.0. The
facility also provides for an accordion feature whereby the Company can increase the
amounts available under the facility up to an additional $150.0, with the consent of the
lenders, if needed to support the Company’s growth. There were no balances
outstanding on the Company’s revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004. The revolving credit facility bears interest at varying rates based
upon the Company’s credit rating with Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. As
of December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility
was 4.87%.

The
senior credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working
capital, capital expenditures, funding of share repurchases and other payments, and
acquisitions. The agreement contains certain debt covenants which require that the Company
maintain leverage and interest coverage ratios of 2.5 to 1.0 and 5.0 to 1.0, respectively.
Both ratios are calculated in relation to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation, and Amortization). The covenants also restrict the payment of dividends. The
Company is in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005.

Zero Coupon Convertible
Subordinated Notes

In
September 2001, the Company sold $650.0 aggregate principal amount at maturity of its zero
coupon convertible subordinated notes (the “notes”) due 2021 in a private
placement. The Company received approximately $426.8 (net of underwriter’s fees of
approximately $9.8) in net proceeds from the offering. In October 2001, the underwriters
exercised their rights to purchase an additional $94.0 aggregate principal amount pursuant
to an overallotment option from which the Company received approximately $61.8 in net
proceeds (net of underwriters fees of approximately $1.4). The notes, which are
subordinate to the Company’s bank debt, were sold at an issue price of $671.65 per
$1,000 principal amount at maturity (representing a yield to maturity of 2.0% per year).
Each one thousand dollar principal amount at maturity of the notes is convertible into
13.4108 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances, if one of the following conditions occurs:

1)

If the sales price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading
               days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day
               of the preceding quarter reaches specified thresholds (beginning at 120% and
               declining 0.1282% per quarter until it reaches approximately 110% for the
               quarter beginning July 1, 2021 of the accreted conversion price per share of
common stock on the last day of the preceding quarter). The accreted conversion price per share
will equal the issue price of a note plus the accrued original issue discount and any
accrued contingent additional principal, divided by the number of shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of a note on that day. The conversion trigger price for the
fourth quarter of 2005 was approximately $64.11.

2)

If the credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
          Services is at or below BB-.

3)

If the notes are called for redemption.

4)

If
          specified corporate transactions have occurred (such as if the Company is party
          to a consolidation,
merger or binding share exchange or a transfer of all or substantially all of its assets).

Holders
of the notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes
on September 11, 2006 and 2011 at $741.92 and $819.54 per note, respectively, plus any
accrued contingent additional principal and any accrued contingent interest thereon.

The
Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after
September 11, 2006 at specified redemption prices per one thousand dollar principal amount
at maturity of the notes ranging from $741.92 at September 11, 2006 to $1,000.00 at
September 11, 2021 (assuming no contingent additional principal accrues on the notes).

The
Company has registered the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of the notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Senior Notes due 2013

On
January 17, 2003, in conjunction with the acquisition of DIANON, the Company borrowed
$350.0 under a bridge loan agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston, acting as
Administrative Agent. On January 31, 2003, the Company sold $350.0 aggregate principal
amount of its 5 1/2% Senior Notes due February 1, 2013. Proceeds from the issuance of
these Notes ($345.1), together with cash on hand was

used to repay the $350.0 principal
amount of the Company’s bridge loan, and as a result, such bridge loan was
terminated.

Senior Notes due 2015

On
December 7, 2005, in conjunction with the execution of an overnight share repurchase
agreement with a bank, the Company borrowed $250.0 under its revolving credit facility. On
December 12, 2005, the Company sold $250.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due
2015. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 5 5/8% per annum from December 14, 2005,
payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2006. Proceeds
from the issuance of these Notes ($247.6), together with cash on hand, were used to repay
the borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

11. PREFERRED STOCK AND

Share Repurchase Program

During
fiscal 2005, the Company purchased 11.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of
$588.7 million. On December 7, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share
repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of 4.8 million shares of the
Company’s outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of $52.04 per
share. The transaction was financed with borrowings under the Company’s
revolving line of credit. The Company used cash on hand and the proceeds of the Senior
Notes due 2015 to repay borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility as
discussed in Note 9. Pursuant to the agreement with the bank, the bank will purchase
4.8 million shares in the open market over a period ending no later than June 13,
2006. At the end of the purchase period, the Company will either receive from or pay
to the bank a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average purchase

(F-18)

LABORATORY CORPORATION
OF AMERICA HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

price of the
shares acquired compared to the initial purchase price. Such price adjustment can be
either in cash or common stock at the discretion of the Company. The Company has
limited its potential financial exposure in the event of an increase in its share price
above a cap during the purchase period with respect to 2.4 million of the repurchased
shares. The shares repurchased under the overnight share repurchase agreement were
immediately canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued
shares. The total cost of the initial purchase was approximately $251.7 million,
including a $1.5 million cap premium and $0.2 million in commissions and other
fees. The Company reduced common stock and additional paid in capital by
approximately $0.5 and $251.2 million, respectively. The forward contract associated with
the overnight share repurchase transaction is being accounted for in accordance with EITF
00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock,” as an equity instrument. Any amounts
paid or received in cash or stock in connection with the price adjustment will be recorded
as an adjustment to Shareholders’ Equity. At December 31, 2005, the price adjustment
would have required the Company to pay $5.3. The diluted net income per share calculation
for fiscal 2005 includes the potential shares of common stock that may be issued to settle
the overnight share repurchase transaction.

As
of December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding authorizations from the Board of
Directors to purchase approximately $285.2 of Company common stock.

Stockholder Rights Plan

The
Company adopted a stockholder rights plan effective as of December 13, 2001 that provides
that each common stockholder of record on December 21, 2001 received a dividend of one
right for each share of common stock held. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from
the Company one-hundredth

of a share of a new series of
participating preferred stock at an initial purchase price of four hundred dollars. These
rights will become exercisable and will detach from the Company’s common stock if any
person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock. In
that event, each right will entitle the holder, other than the acquiring person, to
purchase, for the initial purchase price, shares of the Company’s common stock having
a value of twice the initial purchase price. The rights will expire on December 13, 2011,
unless earlier exchanged or redeemed.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Earnings

The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive earnings were $90.3 and $81.7 at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Substantially all of the balances at December 31,
2005 and 2004 are related to the Company’s net foreign currency translation
adjustments.

The
Company increased its valuation allowance by approximately $1.2 during the second quarter
of 2005 for a write-off of an asset that will result in a capital loss whose realization
by the Company is dependant on future unforeseen capital gains. The Company has state tax
loss carryovers of approximately $37.5 which expire 2006 through 2024. In addition, the
Company has federal tax loss carryovers of approximately $67.3 expiring periodically
through 2024. The utilization of these tax loss carryovers is limited due to change of
ownership rules however at this time the Company expects to fully utilize substantially
all of its tax loss carryovers.

All
income tax years through and including 2002 have been finalized with the Internal Revenue
Service. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company’s 2003
income tax return. Management believes adequate provisions have been recorded related to
all open tax years.

The
Company provided for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

13. STOCK COMPENSATION
PLANS

Stock Incentive Plans

There
are currently 19.68 million shares authorized for issuance under the 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan, the Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1994 Stock Option Plan.
Each of these plans was approved by shareholders. At December 31, 2005, there were 3.6
million additional shares available for grant under the Company’s stock option plans.

Stock Options

The
following table summarizes grants of non-qualified options made by the Company to
officers, key employees, and non-employee directors under all plans. Stock options are
generally granted at an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market price per
share on the date of grant. Also, for each grant, options vest ratably over a period of
two to three years on the anniversaries of the grant date, subject to their earlier
expiration or termination.

Changes
in options outstanding under the plans for the periods indicated were as follows:

Restricted Stock

During
2005, the Company granted aggregate awards of 151,581 shares of restricted stock at a
weighted average price of $47.97 under its 2000 Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted stock
becomes vested annually in equal one third increments beginning on the first anniversary
of the grant. The unearned restricted stock compensation is being amortized to expense
over the applicable vesting periods. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, total restricted stock
compensation expense was $7.6, $15.5 and $18.1, respectively.

Performance Share Awards

During
2005, the Company granted aggregate awards of 434,025 performance share awards at a
weighted average price of $47.92 under its 2000 Stock Incentive Plan. The performance
share awards represent a three year award opportunity for the period 2005-2007 and become
vested in 2008. Performance share awards are subject to certain earnings per share and
revenue targets, the achievement of which may increase or decrease the number of shares
which the grantee receives upon vesting. During 2005, the total compensation expense
related to performance share awards was $6.1.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The
Company has an employee stock purchase plan, begun in 1997 and amended in 1999 and 2004,
with 4,500,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance. The plan permits
substantially all employees to purchase a limited number of shares of Company stock at 85%
of market value. The Company issues shares to participating employees semi-annually in
January and July of each year. Approximately 209, 247, and 290 thousand shares were
purchased by eligible employees in 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.

14. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

On
June 24, 2003, the Company and certain of its executive officers were sued in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in the first of a series
of putative shareholder class actions alleging securities fraud. Shortly thereafter, five
other complaints containing substantially identical allegations were filed against the
Company and certain of the Company’s executive officers. Each of the complaints
alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making material
misstatements and/or omissions that caused the price of the Company’s stock to be
artificially inflated between February 13 and October 3, 2002. The plaintiffs seek
certification of a class of substantially all persons who purchased shares of the
Company’s stock during that time period and unspecified monetary damages. These six
cases have been consolidated and will proceed as a single case. The plaintiffs have filed
a consolidated amended complaint. On July 16, 2004, the defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the consolidated complaint. The defendants deny any liability and continue to
defend the case vigorously. At this time, it is premature to make any assessment of the
potential outcome of the cases or whether they could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition.

The
Company is the appellant in a patent case originally filed by Competitive Technologies,
Inc. and Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment against the
Company for patent infringement, with total damages and attorney’s fees payable by
the Company of approximately $7.8 million. The underlying judgment has been paid. The
Company vigorously contested the judgment and appealed the case to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 8, 2004, that court affirmed the judgment
against the Company and, on August 5, 2004, the Company’s request for rehearing was
denied. On November 3, 2004, the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with
the United States Supreme Court. On October 31, 2005, the Court granted the Company’s
petition, and the case is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on March 21,
2006.

The
Company is also involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. These matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property
disputes, professional liability, employee related matters, and inquiries from
governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid payers and managed care payers requesting
comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through
billing audits or third parties. In the opinion of management, based upon the advice of
counsel and consideration of all facts available at this time, the ultimate disposition of
these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
results of operations or liquidity of the Company. The Company is also named from time to
time in suits brought under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act. These suits
typically allege that the Company has made false statements and/or certifications in
connection with claims for payment from federal health care programs. They may remain
under seal (hence, unknown to the Company) for some time while the government decides
whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Such claims are an inevitable
part of doing business in the health care field today and, in the opinion of management,
based upon the advice of counsel and consideration of all facts available at this time,
the ultimate disposition of those qui tam matters presently known to the Company is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations or liquidity of the Company.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes,
regulations and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The
clinical laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the
courts have not interpreted many of these statutes and regulations. There can be no
assurance therefore that those applicable statutes and regulations might not be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner
that would

adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these
statutes and regulations include significant fines and the loss of various licenses,
certificates and authorizations.

Under
the Company’s present insurance programs, coverage is obtained for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company is
responsible for the uninsured portion of losses related primarily to general, professional
and vehicle liability, certain medical costs and workers’ compensation. The
self-insured retentions are on a per occurrence basis without any aggregate annual limit.
Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon the
Company’s estimates of the aggregated liability of claims incurred. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company had provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $62.6
and $63.5 respectively, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. The
Company’s availability under its revolving credit facility is reduced by amount of
these letters of credit.

The
Company leases various facilities and equipment under non-cancelable lease arrangements.
Future minimum rental commitments for leases with noncancellable terms of one year or more
at December 31, 2005 are as follows:

Rental
expense, which includes rent for real estate, equipment and automobiles under operating
leases, amounted to $119.6, $106.6 and $104.2 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

15. PENSION AND
POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

Pension Plans

The
Company maintains a defined contribution pension plan for all eligible employees. Eligible
employees are defined as individuals who are age 21 or older, have been employed by the
Company for at least one year with 1,000 hours of service during that period. Company
contributions to the plan are based on a percentage of employee contributions. The cost of
this plan was $12.8, $11.0 and $10.9 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
addition, substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a defined benefit
retirement plan (the “Company Plan”). The benefits to be paid under the Company
Plan are based on years of credited service and average final compensation. The
Company’s policy is to fund the Company Plan with at least the minimum amount
required by applicable regulations.

The
Company has a second defined benefit retirement plan which covers its senior management
group that provides for the payment of the difference, if any, between the amount of any
maximum limitation on annual benefit payments under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 and the annual benefit that would be payable under the Company Plan
but for such limitation. This plan is an unfunded plan.

Post-retirement Medical

Coverage under this plan is restricted to a limited number of existing employees of the
subsidiary. This plan is unfunded and the Company’s policy is to fund benefits as
claims are incurred. The effect on operations of the postretirement medical plan is shown

LABORATORY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

(Dollars in millions, except

The weighted-average
discount rates used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 5.6% and 6.0% as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The health
care cost trend rate-medical was assumed to be 10.0% and 10.0% as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, and the trend rate-prescription was assumed to be 12.0% and 12.0% as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, declining gradually to 5.0% in the year 2013.
The health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by a percentage point in each year
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005
by $6.9. The impact of a percentage point change on the aggregate of the service cost and
interest cost components of the 2005 postretirement benefit costs results in an increase
of $0.6 or decrease of $0.5.

The
following assumed benefit payments under the Company’s postretirement benefit plan,
which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, and were used in the calculation of
projected benefit obligations, are expected to be paid as follows:

18. NEW ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

. This
Statement amends the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.

That statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in
that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement
amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception to for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. The Company has not historically entered into a significant level
of nonmonetary transactions and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact
is financial position or results.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations

(FIN 47) which is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2005 and is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”. FIN 47 requires recognition of a
liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if
the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The adoption of FIN 47 did
not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections”, which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2005. This
statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20 “Accounting Changes” (APB 20) and SFAS No.
3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements”. APB 20
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by
including, in net income of the period of the change, the cumulative effect of changing to
the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior
periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of
the change. The Company does not expect that this standard will impact its financial
position or results of operations.
