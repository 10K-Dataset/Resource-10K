PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings and its subsidiaries (the “Company”),
headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina, is the second largest independent clinical
laboratory company in the United States based on 2004 net revenues. Since its founding in
1971, the Company has grown into a national network of 32 primary laboratories and over
1,300 service sites, consisting of branches, patient service centers and STAT
laboratories, which are laboratories that have the ability to perform certain routine
tests quickly and report the results to the physician immediately. Through its national
network of laboratories, the Company offers a broad range of clinical laboratory tests
which are used by the medical profession in routine testing, patient diagnosis, and in the
monitoring and treatment of disease. In addition, the Company has developed specialty and
niche businesses based on certain types of specialized testing capabilities and client
requirements, such as oncology testing, HIV genotyping and phenotyping, diagnostic
genetics and clinical research trials. The Company has significantly expanded its routine
and specialty testing businesses through the acquisitions of Dynacare Inc.
(“Dynacare”), DIANON Systems, Inc. (“DIANON”), and US Pathology Labs,
Inc. (“US LABS”). The acquisition of Dynacare, a provider of clinical laboratory
testing services in 21 states in the United States and two provinces in Canada has enabled
the Company to expand its national testing network. DIANON is a leading national provider
of anatomic pathology and genetic testing services with a primary focus on advanced
oncology testing. The acquisition of DIANON and the recently completed acquisition of US
LABS, with an anatomic pathology offering tailored to hospital based pathologists, further
enhances the Company’s oncology testing capabilities and positions it to more
effectively market and distribute the advanced testing technologies that the Company has
developed internally or has licensed from its technology partners, such as EXACT Sciences
Corporation, Celera Diagnostics and Correlogic Systems, Inc.

With
approximately 23,500 employees, the Company processes tests on more than 355,000 patient
specimens daily and provides clinical laboratory testing services to clients in all 50
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three provinces in Canada. Its clients
include physicians, hospitals, HMOs and other managed care organizations, governmental
agencies, large employers, and other independent clinical laboratories that do not have
the breadth of its testing capabilities. Several hundred of the Company’s tests are
frequently used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a diagnosis,
to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. The most
frequently-requested of these routine tests include blood chemistry analyses, urinalyses,
blood cell counts, Pap tests, HIV tests, microbiology cultures and procedures, and alcohol
and other substance-abuse tests. The Company performs this core group of routine tests in
each of its major laboratories using sophisticated and computerized instruments, with most
results reported within 24 hours.

The
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports
on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through
the Media and Investor Relations section of the Company’s internet website at
www.labcorp.com as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with,
or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The
Company is committed to providing the highest quality laboratory services to its clients
in full compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. The
Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics outlines ethics and compliance policies
adopted by the Company to meet this commitment. These policies apply to all employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries as well as the Company’s Board of Directors. The
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as well as the Charters for the Audit, Compensation,
Ethics and Quality Assurance, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, and the
Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, are posted on the Company’s website
www.labcorp.com. The Company has established a Compliance Action hotline (1-800-801-1005),
which provides a confidential and anonymous method to report a possible violation of a
LabCorp compliance policy or procedure, or a federal or state law or regulation; a HIPAA
Privacy hotline (1-877-234-4722), which provides a confidential and anonymous method for
an employee to report a possible violation of a

(4)

HIPAA privacy, security or billing
policy or procedure; and an Accounting hotline (1-866-469-6893), which provides a
confidential and anonymous method for an employee to report a possible violation of
internal accounting controls or auditing matters.

The Clinical Laboratory
Testing Industry

Laboratory
tests and procedures are used generally by hospitals, physicians and other health care
providers and commercial clients to assist in the diagnosis, evaluation, detection,
monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions through the examination
of substances in the blood, tissues and other specimens. Clinical laboratory testing is
generally categorized as either clinical pathology testing, which is performed on body
fluids including blood, or anatomical pathology testing, which is performed on cytologic
samples, tissue and other samples, including human cells. Clinical and anatomical
pathology procedures are frequently ordered as part of regular physician office visits and
hospital admissions in connection with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses. Certain
of these tests and procedures are used as tools in the diagnosis and management of a wide
variety of medical conditions such as cancer, AIDS, endocrine disorders, cardiac disorders
and genetic disease.

The
clinical laboratory industry consists primarily of three types of providers:
hospital-based laboratories, physician-office laboratories and independent clinical
laboratories, such as those owned by the Company. The Company believes that in 2003 the
entire United States clinical laboratory testing industry had estimated revenues of
approximately $40 billion; approximately 53% of such revenues were attributable to
hospital-affiliated laboratories, approximately 40% were attributable to independent
clinical laboratories and others, and approximately 7% were attributable to physicians in
their offices and laboratories. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has
estimated that in 2003 there were approximately 5,000 independent clinical laboratories in
the United States.

The
clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive. There are presently two national
independent clinical laboratories: the Company and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated
(“Quest”), which had approximately $5.1 billion in revenues from clinical
laboratory testing in 2004. In addition to the other national clinical laboratory, the
Company competes with many smaller regional independent clinical laboratories as well as
laboratories owned by hospitals and physicians. The Company believes that the following
factors, among others, are often used by health care providers in selecting a laboratory:
i) pricing of the laboratory’s test services; ii) accuracy, timeliness and
consistency in reporting test results; iii) number and type of tests performed; iv)
service capability and convenience offered by the laboratory; and v) its reputation in the
medical community. The Company believes that it competes favorably with its principal
competitors in each of these areas and is currently implementing strategies to improve its
competitive position.

The
Company believes that consolidation will continue in the clinical laboratory testing
business. In addition, the Company believes that it and the other large independent
clinical laboratory testing companies will be able to increase their share of the overall
clinical laboratory testing market due to a number of external factors including cost
efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing, Medicare reimbursement reductions
and the growth of managed health care entities which require low-cost testing services and
large service networks. In addition, legal restrictions on physician referrals and their
ownership of laboratories as well as increased regulation of laboratories are expected to
contribute to the continuing consolidation of the industry.

Effect of Market Changes
on the Clinical Laboratory Business

Many
market-based changes in the clinical laboratory business have occurred over the past ten
years, primarily as a result of the shift away from traditional, fee-for-service medicine
to managed-cost health care. The growth of the managed care sector presents various
challenges to the Company and other independent clinical laboratories. Managed care
organizations typically contract with a limited number of

(5)

clinical laboratories and negotiate
discounts to the fees charged by such laboratories in an effort to control costs. In
addition, managed care organizations have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt
to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. Under a capitated
payment contract, the clinical laboratory and the managed care organization agree to a per
member, per month payment to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of
the number or cost of the tests actually performed. The Company makes significant efforts
to ensure that esoteric tests (which are more sophisticated tests used to obtain
information not provided by routine tests and generally involve a higher level of
complexity and more substantial human involvement than routine tests) are excluded from
capitated arrangements and therefore paid for separately by the managed care organization.
Capitated payment contracts shift the risks of additional testing beyond that covered by
the capitated payment to the clinical laboratory. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $132.7 million or 4.3% of the
Company’s net sales.

In
addition, Medicare (which principally services patients 65 and older), Medicaid (which
principally serves low-income patients) and insurers have increased their efforts to
control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. Measures to regulate
health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have resulted in
reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory
industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative
requirements. From time to time, Congress has also considered changes to the Medicare fee
schedules in conjunction with certain budgetary bills. The Company believes that
reductions in reimbursement for Medicare services will continue to be implemented from
time to time. Reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers are likely
to occur as well.

Despite
the potential market changes discussed above, the Company believes that the volume of
clinical laboratory testing will be positively influenced by several factors, including
the expanded base of genomics knowledge, which has led to an enhanced appreciation of the
value of gene-based diagnostic assays for current patient care as well as for the
development of new therapeutics. Additionally, these novel gene-based tests have led to an
increased awareness by physicians that clinical laboratory testing is a cost-effective
means of prevention and early detection of disease and monitoring of treatment. In an
effort to better offer new technology as medical needs and standards of care develop, the
Company has entered into a number of licensing and technology distribution agreements with
such leading-edge diagnostic testing technology providers as: Atherotech (cardiovascular
disease risk assessment), EXACT Sciences (colorectal cancer detection), BioPredictive
(determination of liver fibrosis), Celera (development of new gene-based assays in a
variety of disease areas) and Correlogic Systems (ovarian cancer detection).

Additional
factors which may lead to future volume growth include an increase in the number and types
of tests which are readily available (due to advances in technology and increased cost
efficiencies) for testing of cancer and infectious diseases and the general aging of the
population in the United States. The impact of these factors is expected to be partially
offset by declines in volume as a result of increased controls over the utilization of
laboratory services by Medicare and other third-party payers, particularly managed care
organizations. In addition, movement by patients into consumer driven health plans may
have an impact on the utilization of laboratory testing.

Laboratory Testing
Operations and Services

The
Company has 32 primary laboratories, and over 1,300 service sites, consisting of branches,
patient service centers and STAT laboratories. A branch is a central facility which
collects specimens in a region for shipment to one of the Company’s laboratories for
testing. A branch also is used as a base for sales staff. Generally, a patient service
center is a facility maintained by the Company to serve the patients of physicians in a
medical professional building or other strategic location. The patient service center
collects the specimens as requested by the physician. The specimens are sent, principally
through the Company’s in-house courier system (and, to a lesser extent, through
independent couriers), to one of the Company’s primary testing facilities for
testing. Some of the Company’s patient service centers also function as STAT labs,
which are laboratories that have the ability to perform certain routine tests quickly and
report results to

(6)

the physician immediately. Patient
specimens are delivered to the Company accompanied by a test request form. These forms,
which are completed by the client or the Company Patient Service Technician, indicate the
tests to be performed and provide the necessary billing information.

Each
specimen and related request form is checked for completeness and then given a unique
identification number. The unique identification number assigned to each specimen helps to
ensure that the results are attributed to the correct patient. The test request forms are
sent to a data entry operator who ensures that a file is established for each patient and
the necessary testing and billing information is entered. Once this information is entered
into the computer system, the tests are performed and the results are entered through
computer interface or manually, depending upon the tests and the type of equipment
involved. Most of the Company’s computerized testing equipment is connected to the
Company’s information systems. Most routine testing is completed by early the next
morning and test results are in most cases electronically delivered to clients via smart
printers, personal computer-based products or computer interfaces. It is Company policy to
notify the client immediately if a life-threatening result is found at any point during
the course of the testing process.

Company Strategy

The
Company’s strategic plan focuses on expanding national coverage, setting exceptional
service standards, expanding its leading position in genomic testing and meeting the
evolving needs of managed care payers, physicians and patients.

Expand
and Leverage National Infrastructure

The
Company’s growing national presence provides a number of significant benefits and it
intends to maintain and continue to build this presence. The Company’s national
network of 32 primary laboratories and over 1,300 service sites, consisting of branches,
patient service centers and STAT laboratories, enables it to provide high-quality services
to physicians, hospitals, managed care organizations and other customers across the United
States. The Company’s managed care contracts with United Healthcare, Aetna, Cigna,
and Wellpoint demonstrate the importance of being able to deliver services on a nationwide
basis. Furthermore, the Company’s scale provides it with significant cost structure
advantages, particularly related to supply and other operating costs.

Customer
Retention

Providing
exceptional customer service is one of the Company’s highest priorities. Customer
retention requires understanding the unique needs and challenges that face each of our
customer segments and providing solutions that address them. The Company continually seeks
to improve its offerings in physician education tools, integrated information management
solutions, improved customer care initiatives and innovative patient information guides.
These customer retention activities are designed to further our success in all aspects of
our business.

Scientific
Differentiation

The
Company believes that it has differentiated itself from its competition and positioned
itself for continued strong growth by building a leadership position in genomic and other
advanced testing technologies. This leadership position enables the Company to provide a
broad menu of testing services for the genetics and cancer markets, which it believes
represent two of the most significant areas of future growth in the clinical laboratory
industry. The Company’s strategic objective in scientific differentiation is to
expand its leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies in order
to deliver outstanding and innovative clinical testing services to patients and physicians
nationwide.

(7)

Develop
and Be First to Market with New Tests

Advances
in medicine have begun to fundamentally change diagnostic testing, and new tests are
allowing clinical laboratories to provide unprecedented amounts of health-related
information to physicians and patients. Significant new tests introduced over the past
several years include a gene-based test for human papilloma virus as well as tests for HIV
phenotyping and cystic fibrosis. As science continues to advance, the Company expects new
testing technologies to emerge; therefore, it intends to continue to invest in advanced
testing capabilities so that it can remain on the cutting edge of clinical laboratory
testing. The Company has added, and expects to continue to add, new testing technologies
and capabilities through a combination of internal development initiatives, technology
licensing and partnership transactions and selected business acquisitions. Through its
national sales force, the Company rapidly introduces new testing technologies to physician
customers. This differentiation is important in the retention and growth of business.

Capitalize
on Unique Opportunities with New Testing Technologies

The
Company has announced a number of significant licensing and technology distribution
agreements which provide it with access to exciting new testing technologies that it
expects will have an increasing impact on diagnostic testing. For example, in June 2002,
the Company announced the creation of an exclusive, long-term strategic agreement with
EXACT Sciences to commercialize PreGen-Plus, EXACT Sciences’ proprietary,
non-invasive technology to aid in the early detection of colorectal cancer. The Company
commercially launched this gene-based test, which represents a significant new tool for
the early detection of colorectal cancer, in August of 2003. The Company is collaborating
with Celera Diagnostics to determine the clinical utility of laboratory tests based on
novel diagnostic markers for breast cancer and prostate cancer and will have exclusive
access to any related markers found to have clinical utility. In addition, the Company has
signed a co-exclusive licensing agreement with Correlogic Systems to commercialize its
ovarian cancer protein pattern blood test, which offers the prospect of accurate and early
detection of ovarian cancer.

In
July 2003, the Company announced a marketing and distribution relationship with
Atherotech, a leading cardiodiagnostic company and specialty reference laboratory, to
offer its proprietary Vertical Auto Profile (VAP™) Cholesterol Test. This multi-year
agreement includes a provision for the transfer of patented testing technology to the
Company, after which, if certain conditions are met, the Company would become the first
clinical laboratory licensed to perform the VAP cardiovascular disease risk assessment
assay within its own national laboratory system.

In
August of 2003, the Company formed a new, majority-owned subsidiary for the purpose of
developing new ideas, inventions, products, processes and services for diagnostic testing
and monitoring in the medical, pharmaceutical, and/or therapeutic markets. The initial
areas of interest include West Nile Virus, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, Oxidative
Markers of DNA stress and Cancer Markers.

During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company and BioPredictive, a French diagnostics firm,
announced an exclusive agreement that combines the Company’s expertise in infectious
disease testing with BioPredictive’s noninvasive, predictive testing technology to
quantitatively estimate liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity in hepatitis C
“HCV” patients. HCV FIBROSURE™ was made available in the U.S., only through
the Company, beginning in the first quarter of 2004.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a multi-year agreement with Cytyc for
their ThinPrep Imaging System. The ThinPrep Imaging System is the first fully integrated,
interactive computer system that assists cytotechnologists and pathologists in the primary
screening and diagnosis of ThinPrep Pap Test slides. The company intends to complete its
nationwide implementation of this state-of-the-art cervical cancer screening instrument by
mid-2005.

The Company's investment in new testing technologies has been significant.  While the Company

(8)

continues to believe its strategy of
entering into licensing and technology distribution agreements with the developers of
leading-edge technologies will provide future growth in revenues, there are certain risks
associated with these investments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk
that the licensed technology will not gain broad acceptance in the marketplace; or that
insurance companies, managed care organizations, or Medicare and Medicaid will not approve
reimbursement for these tests at a level commensurate with the costs of running the tests.
Any or all of these circumstances could result in impairment in the value of certain
capitalized licensing costs.

Enhance the Company’s Oncology Testing Business by Leveraging the Unique Capabilities
of DIANON and US LABS

DIANON
and US LABS are national providers of oncology testing services and significantly enhance
the Company’s oncology testing capabilities. These companies are recognized by
physicians, managed care companies and other customers as leading providers of a wide
range of anatomic pathology testing services, with particular strength in uropathology,
dermatopathology, GI pathology and hematopathology. DIANON and US LABS’ strengths in
anatomic pathology complement the Company’s strengths in other areas of cancer
testing, particularly cytology. The Company expects that the specialized sales force,
scientific expertise, efficient operating model and proprietary clinical and pathology
reporting systems of DIANON and US LABS will allow it to enhance its cancer testing
business. The Company began extending DIANON’s standardized anatomic pathology
processes to other Company pathology sites in early 2004 and has implemented these best
practices in four major Company sites.

Become
the Laboratory of Choice for Managed Care

Strong
managed care partnerships are key to the Company, both to secure appropriate payment for
our services and as distribution channels for the Company’s new and existing
products. As such, they also contribute to the establishment and implementation of our
scientific leadership priorities. The Company has devoted substantial business and
scientific resources to our managed care customers to ensure that it is providing this
growing segment with the creative solutions and quality services that they expect.
LabCorp’s external Managed Care Advisory Panel and internal Managed Care Economic and
Scientific Advisory Review Process are critical to understanding the evolution of this
business segment and communicating the economic and social benefits of advanced laboratory
testing.

Testing Services

Routine
Testing

The
Company currently offers a broad range of clinical laboratory tests and procedures.
Several hundred of these are frequently used in general patient care by physicians to
establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or medication, or to search for an
otherwise undiagnosed condition. The most frequently requested tests include blood
chemistry analyses, urinalyses, blood cell counts, Pap tests, HIV tests, microbiology
cultures and procedures and alcohol and other substance-abuse tests. These routine
procedures are most often used by physicians in their outpatient office practices.
Physicians may elect to send such procedures to an independent laboratory or they may
choose to establish an in-house laboratory to perform some of the tests.

The
Company performs this core group of routine tests in each of its primary laboratories,
which constitutes a majority of the testing performed by the Company. The Company
generally performs and reports most routine procedures within 24 hours, utilizing a
variety of sophisticated and computerized laboratory testing instruments.

Specialty
and Niche Testing

While
the information provided by many routine tests may be used by nearly all physicians,
regardless

(9)

of specialty, many other procedures
are more specialized in nature. One of the growth strategies of the Company is the
continued expansion of its specialty and niche businesses, which involve certain types of
unique testing capabilities and/or client requirements. In general, the specialty and
niche businesses are designed to serve two market segments: (i) markets which are not
typically served by the clinical testing laboratory; and (ii) markets which are served by
the clinical testing laboratory and offer the possibility of adding related services (such
as clinical trials or occupational drug testing) from the same supplier. The
Company’s research and development group continually seeks new and improved
technologies for early diagnosis. For example, the Company’s Center for Molecular
Biology and Pathology (“CMBP”) is a leader in molecular diagnostics and
polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) technologies, which are often able to provide
earlier and more reliable information regarding HIV, genetic diseases, cancer and many
other viral and bacterial diseases. In August 2000, the Company acquired Los Angeles-based
National Genetics Institute, Inc. (NGI), a leader in the development of PCR assays for
Hepatitis C (HCV). In June 2001, the Company acquired Minneapolis-based Viro-Med
Laboratories, Inc., which offers molecular microbial testing using real time PCR
platforms. Management believes these technologies may represent a significant savings to
the healthcare system by increasing the detection of early stage (treatable) diseases. The
following are specialty and niche businesses in which the Company offers testing and
related services:

Allergy
Testing.

The Company offers an extensive range of allergen testing services as well as
computerized analysis and a treatment program that enables primary care physicians to
diagnose and treat many kinds of allergic disorders.

Clinical
Trials Testing.

The Company regularly performs clinical laboratory testing for
pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical research trials on new drugs. This testing
often involves periodic testing of patients participating in the trial over several years.

Diagnostic
Genetics.

The Company offers cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, biochemical and
molecular genetic tests.

Identity
Testing.

The Company provides forensic identity testing used in connection with
criminal proceedings and parentage evaluation services which are used to assist in the
resolution of disputed parentage in child support litigation. Parentage testing involves
the evaluation of immunological and genetic markers in specimens obtained from the child,
the mother and the alleged father. Management believes it is now the largest provider of
identity testing services in the United States.

Infectious
Disease

. The Company provides complete viral load testing as well as HIV genotyping
and phenotyping. In 2000, the Company added HIV GenoSure™ to its portfolio of HIV
resistance testing services. The Company’s use of this leading-edge technology puts
it in the forefront of HIV drug resistance testing one of the most important issues
surrounding the treatment of HIV. Additionally, the Company provides comprehensive testing
for HCV including both PCR testing and genotyping at CMBP, NGI and Viro-Med.

Oncology
Testing

. The Company offers an extensive series of testing technologies that aid in
diagnosing and monitoring certain cancers and predicting the outcome of certain
treatments. The Company’s scientists have novel assays for detecting melanoma and
breast cancer in clinical development. In August of 2003, the Company began offering
PreGen-Plus, a non-invasive technology to aid in the early detection of colorectal cancer
in a broader population. PreGen-Plus utilizes EXACT Sciences’ proprietary
genomics-based technology. In January 2003, the Company acquired DIANON, a national
provider of oncology testing services. DIANON is recognized by physicians, managed care
companies and other customers as a leading provider of a wide range of anatomic pathology
testing services, with particular strength in uropathology, dermatopathology, GI pathology
and hematopathology. In February 2005, the Company acquired US LABS, a national provider
of cancer testing.

(10)

Occupational
Testing Services

. The Company provides urine and blood testing services for the
detection of drug and alcohol abuse for private and government customers. These testing
services are designed to produce “forensic” quality test results that satisfy
the rigorous requirements for admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings. The Company
also provides other analytical testing and a variety of management support services.

The
specialized or niche testing services noted above, as well as other complex procedures,
are sent to designated facilities where the Company has concentrated the people,
instruments and related resources for performing such procedures so that quality and
efficiency can be most effectively monitored. CMBP, NGI and Viro-Med also specialize in
new test development and related education and training.

Clients

The
Company provides testing services to a broad range of health care providers. During the
year ended December 31, 2004, no client or group of clients under the same contract
accounted for more than four percent of the Company’s net sales. The primary client
groups serviced by the Company include:

Independent
Physicians and Physician Groups

Physicians
requiring testing for their patients are one of the Company’s primary sources of
testing services. Fees for clinical laboratory testing services rendered for these
physicians are billed either to the physician, to the patient or the patient’s third
party payer such as an insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid. Billings are typically on
a fee-for-service basis. If the billings are to the physician, they are based on a
customer fee schedule and subject to negotiation. Otherwise, the patient or third party
payer is billed at the laboratory’s patient fee schedule, subject to third party
payer limitations and negotiation by physicians on behalf of their patients. Revenues
received from Medicare and Medicaid billings are based on government-set fee schedules and
reimbursement rules.

Hospitals

The
Company provides hospitals with services ranging from routine and specialty testing to
contract management services. Hospitals generally maintain an on-site laboratory to
perform immediately needed testing on patients receiving care. However, they also refer
less time sensitive procedures, less frequently needed procedures and highly specialized
procedures to outside facilities, including independent clinical laboratories and larger
medical centers. The Company typically charges hospitals for any such tests on a
fee-for-service basis which is derived from the Company’s customer fee schedule. Fees
for management services are billed monthly at contractually agreed-upon rates.

HMOs
and Other Managed Care Groups

The
Company serves HMOs and other managed care organizations. These medical service providers
typically contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and then designate the
laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. The
majority of the Company’s managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service
basis. Testing is sometimes reimbursed on a capitated basis for managed care
organizations. Under a capitated payment contract, the Company agrees to perform certain
laboratory tests during a given month for which the managed care organization agrees to
pay a flat monthly fee for each covered member. The tests covered under agreements of this
type are negotiated for each contract, but usually include routine tests and exclude
highly specialized tests. Many of the national and large regional managed care
organizations prefer to use large independent clinical labs such as the Company because
they can monitor service and performance on a national basis.

Other
Institutions

The
Company serves other institutions, including governmental agencies, large employers and
other

(11)

independent clinical laboratories
that do not have the breadth of the Company’s testing capabilities. The institutions
typically pay on a negotiated fee-for-service basis.

Payers

Most
testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person
who ordered the test. In addition, tests performed by a single physician may be billed to
different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient.
Payers other than the direct patient include, among others, insurance companies, managed

Investments in Joint
Venture Partnerships

In
conjunction with the acquisition of Dynacare in 2002, the Company holds investments in
three joint venture partnerships, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Ontario, Canada; and
Alberta, Canada. These businesses represent partnership agreements between Dynacare and
other independent diagnostic laboratory investors. Under these agreements, all partners
share in the profits and losses of the businesses in proportion to their respective
ownership percentages. All partners are actively involved in the major business decisions
made by each joint venture.

Each
of the Canadian partnerships own licenses to conduct diagnostic testing services in their
respective provinces. Substantially all of their revenues are received as reimbursement
from the provincial governments’ health care programs. While the Canadian licenses
guarantee the joint ventures the ability to conduct diagnostic testing in their respective
provinces, they do not guarantee that the provincial governments will continue to
reimburse diagnostic laboratory testing at current levels. If the provincial governments
decide to limit or reduce their reimbursement of laboratory diagnostic services, it could
have a negative impact on the profits and cash flows the Company derives from these
investments as well as possibly impair the value assigned by the Company to the Canadian
joint ventures.

Sales and Marketing and
Client Service

The
Company offers its services through a combination of direct sales generalists and
specialists. Sales generalists market the mainstream or traditional routine laboratory
services primarily to physicians, while specialists concentrate on individual market
segments, such as hospitals or managed care organizations, or on testing niches, such as
identity testing or genetic testing. Specialist positions are established when an in-depth
level of expertise is necessary to effectively offer the specialized services. When the
need arises, specialists and generalists work cooperatively to address specific
opportunities. The Company’s sales generalists and specialists are compensated
through a combination of salaries, commissions and bonuses, at levels commensurate with
each individual’s qualifications and responsibilities. Commissions are primarily
based upon the individual’s productivity in generating new business for the Company.

The
Company also employs regional service managers and account managers (“AMs”) to
interact with clients on an ongoing basis. AMs monitor the status of the services being
provided to clients, act as

(12)

problem-solvers, provide information
on new testing developments and serve as the client’s regular point of contact with
the Company. AMs are compensated through a combination of salaries and bonuses
commensurate with each individual’s qualifications and responsibilities.

The
Company believes that the clinical laboratory service business is shifting away from the
traditional direct sales structure to one in which the purchasing decisions for laboratory
services are increasingly being made by managed care organizations, insurance plans,
employers and even by patients themselves. In view of these changes, the Company has
adapted its sales and marketing structure to more appropriately address the opportunities
presented by this shift.

The
Company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of its testing, reporting and
information systems, its reputation in the medical community, client service, test menu,
the pricing of its services and its ability to employ qualified personnel.

Information Systems

The
Company has developed and implemented management information systems to monitor operations
and control costs. All financial functions are centralized in Burlington, North Carolina
including purchasing, accounting, payroll and billing. Management believes this provides
greater control over spending as well as increased supervision and monitoring of results
of operations.

The
Company believes that the health care provider’s need for data will continue to place
high demands on the Company’s information systems staff. The Company operates several
systems to handle laboratory, billing and financial data and transactions. The Company
believes that the efficient handling of information involving clients, patients, payers
and other parties will be a critical factor in the Company’s future success. The
Company’s Corporate Information Systems Division manages its information resources
and programs on a consolidated basis in order to achieve greater efficiency and economies
of scale. The Company employs a Chief Information Officer, whose responsibility is to
integrate, manage and develop the Company’s information systems.

Billing

Billing
for laboratory services is a complex process. Laboratories must bill many different payers
such as doctors, patients, hundreds of different insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid
and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. The Company
believes that a majority of its bad debt expense is the result of non-credit related
issues which slow the billing process. A primary cause of bad debt expense is missing or
incorrect billing information on requisitions. The Company believes that this experience
is similar to that of its primary competitors. The Company generally performs the
requested tests and returns the test results regardless of whether billing information is
incorrect or incomplete. The Company subsequently attempts to obtain any missing
information or rectify any incorrect billing information received from the health care
provider. Among the many other factors complicating the billing process are more intricate
billing arrangements due to contracts with third-party administrators, disputes between
payers as to the party responsible for payment of the bill and auditing for specific
compliance issues.

During
2004, the Company substantially completed its consolidation of lab and billing systems
onto the centralized system. The Company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) were reduced
1 day from December 31, 2003 levels to 52 days as a result of Company-wide efforts to
increase cash collections from all payers, as well as on-going improvements to the claim
submission processes. The Company is continuing to take the steps necessary to improve DSO
and cash collections. Although there can be no assurance of success, the Company has
developed a number of initiatives to address the complexity of the billing process and to
improve collection rates by:

1)

continuing to reduce the number of requisitions received that are missing
          certain billing information.

(13)

This initiative involves counting the number of clinical requisitions received with missing
information by ordering client, as well as determining what specific information was not
provided. The Company then identifies root causes of why the information was missing and
takes steps to ensure that information is provided in the future. These steps include
re-educating clients as to what information is needed in order for the Company to bill and
collect for the test;

2)

implementing numerous initiatives related to self-pay accounts receivable. These
                    include: i) collecting payment at the time of service; ii) increased training
                    for billing personnel related to improving collections during phone calls and
                    iii) review of bill design and frequency;

3)

installing personal computer based products in client offices and Company
                    locations to help with the accuracy and completeness of billing information
                    captured on the front-end;

4)

developing and implementing enhanced eligibility checking to compare information
                    to payer records before billing.

Quality Assurance

The
Company considers the quality of its tests to be of critical importance, and it has
established a comprehensive quality assurance program for all of its laboratories and
other facilities designed to help assure accurate and timely test results. In addition to
the compulsory external inspections and proficiency programs required by CMS and other
regulatory agencies, Company-wide systems and procedures are in place to emphasize and
monitor quality assurance. All of the Company’s regional laboratories are subject to
on-site evaluations, the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) proficiency
testing program, state surveys and the Company’s own internal quality control
programs.

External Proficiency/Accreditations.

The Company participates in numerous
externally-administered, blind quality surveillance programs, including the CAP program.
The blind programs supplement all other quality assurance procedures and give Company
management the opportunity to review its technical and service performance from the
client’s perspective.

Internal Quality Control.

The Company regularly performs internal quality control
testing by running quality control samples with known values at the same time as patient
samples submitted for testing. All quality control sample test results are entered into
the Company’s national laboratory computer, which connects the Company’s
facilities nationwide to a common on-line quality control database. This system helps
technologists and technicians check quality control values and requires further prompt
verification if any quality control value is out of range. The Company has an extensive,
internally administered program of blind sample proficiency testing (i.e. the testing
laboratory does not know the sample being tested is a quality control sample). As part of
this program the Company’s locations receive specimens from the Company’s
Quality Assurance and Corporate Technical Services departments for analysis.

The
CAP accreditation program involves both on-site inspections of the laboratory and
participation in CAP’s proficiency testing program for all categories in which the
laboratory is accredited by CAP. CAP is an independent non-governmental organization of
board-certified pathologists which offers an accreditation program to which laboratories
can voluntarily subscribe. CAP has been accredited by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories
to determine adherence to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, and the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 standards. A laboratory’s receipt
of accreditation by CAP satisfies the Medicare requirement for participation in
proficiency testing programs administered by an external source. All of the Company’s
major laboratories are accredited by CAP.

The
Company’s forensic crime laboratory, located at Research Triangle Park, NC, is
accredited by the

(14)

American Society of Crime Laboratory
Directors, Laboratory Accreditation Board (“ASCLD/LAB”) in the category of DNA
testing. Under the Crime Laboratory Accreditation Program managed by the ASCLD/LAB, a
crime laboratory undergoes a comprehensive and in-depth inspection to demonstrate that its
management, operations, employees, procedures and instruments, physical plant, and
security and personnel safety procedures meet stringent quality standards. The Company is
one of 279 ASCLD accredited crime laboratories worldwide and is one of only twelve private
crime laboratories holding the accreditation. Accreditation is granted for a period of
five years provided that a laboratory continues to meet the standards during that period.

Employees

As
of January 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 23,500 full-time equivalent employees.
Subsidiaries of the Company have four collective bargaining agreements which cover
approximately 650 employees. One of the collective bargaining agreements covering
approximately 530 employees in Seattle will expire on May 31, 2005. Negotiations over a
successor agreement are expected to commence in March 2005. The Company believes its
overall relations with its employees are good.

Regulation and
Reimbursement

General

The
clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental regulation at the
federal, state and local levels. As described below, these regulations concern licensure
and operation of clinical laboratories, payment for laboratory services, health care fraud
and abuse, security and confidentiality of health information, quality, environmental and
occupational safety.

Regulation
of Clinical Laboratories

The
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) extend federal
oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by
the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. CLIA requires that
all clinical laboratories must meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel
standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to
inspections.

Standards
for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the
laboratory, with tests classified as either “high complexity”, “moderate
complexity”, or “waived. ” Laboratories performing high complexity testing
are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories.
Labs performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the Food and Drug
Administration to have a low potential for error and requiring little or no oversight, may
apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA.
All major and many smaller Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high
complexity testing. The Company’s remaining smaller testing sites hold CLIA
certificates to perform moderate complexity testing or a certificate of waiver.

The
sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or
limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct
business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare
and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The
loss or suspension of a license, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future
changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The
Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a
state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under
federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory
schemes. State laws may require that laboratory

(15)

personnel meet certain
qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain
records. For example, some of the Company’s laboratories are subject to the State of
New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which contain provisions that are more
stringent than those under federal law.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, and
the Company’s laboratories have continuing programs to ensure that their operations
meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the
Company’s laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.

Payment
for Clinical Laboratory Services

In
2004 and 2003, the Company derived approximately 20% and 19%, respectively of its net
sales from tests performed for beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In
addition, the Company’s other business depends significantly on continued
participation in these programs, and other government healthcare programs, because clients
often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years,
both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health
care costs, including reducing reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.

Reimbursement
under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory services is subject to a
clinical laboratory fee schedule which sets the maximum amount payable in each Medicare
carrier’s jurisdiction. This clinical laboratory fee schedule is updated annually.
Laboratories bill the program directly and must accept the scheduled amount as payment in
full for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. State Medicaid
programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical
laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.

Payment
under the fee schedule has been limited from year to year by Congressional action,
including imposition of national limitation amounts and freezes on the otherwise
applicable annual Consumer Price Index “CPI” updates. For most diagnostic lab
tests, the national limitation is now 74% of the national median of all local fee
schedules established for each test. Under a provision of the Medicare, Medicaid, and
SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”), the cap is set
at 100% of the median for tests performed after January 1, 2001 that the Secretary
determines are new tests for which no limitation amount has previously been established.

Following
a 5 year freeze on CPI updates to the clinical lab fee schedule, there was a 1.19%
increase in the fee schedule in 2003. However, in late 2003, the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) again imposed a freeze
in the Consumer Price Index update of the clinical lab fee schedule for 2004 through 2008.

Separate
from clinical diagnostic laboratory services, which generally are reimbursed under the
Medicare laboratory fee schedule, many pathology services are reimbursed under the
Medicare physician fee schedule. The physician fee schedule assigns relative value units
to each procedure or service, and a conversion factor is applied to calculate the
reimbursement. The physician fee schedule also is subject to adjustment on an annual
basis. The formula used to calculate the fee schedule resulted in significant decreases in
payment for most physician services in 2003. However, Congress intervened and the
conversion factor was increased for the period March 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003.
The conversion factor was again expected to decrease significantly in 2004 and 2005, but
the MMA included a provision requiring increases in each of these years of not less than
1.5%. Accordingly, the conversion factor was, in fact, increased 1.5% in each of these
years. Unless Congress acts to change the basis on which the fee schedule is calculated,
or mandates another increase, the conversion factor is likely to decrease in 2006.

The
MMA also included a provision requiring CMS to conduct a demonstration program on using
competitive acquisition for clinical lab tests that are furnished without a face-to-face
encounter between the individual and the hospital personnel or physician performing the
test. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) is
required to make an initial report to Congress on this

(16)

demonstration program no later than
December 31, 2005. Details of CMS’ plans regarding this demonstration program have
not yet been released, but widespread use of competitive acquisition, if implemented for
clinical lab services, could have a significant effect on the clinical laboratory industry
and the Company. In addition, some States have initiated efforts to establish competitive
bidding processes for the provision of laboratory services under the State Medicaid
program.

Because
a significant portion of the Company’s costs are relatively fixed, Medicare, Medicaid
and other government program payment reductions have a direct adverse affect on the
Company’s net earnings and cash flows, but the Company cannot predict whether changes
that will result in such reductions will be implemented.

Congressional
action in 1997 required HHS to adopt uniform coverage, administration and payment policies
for lab tests using a negotiated rulemaking process. Consensus was reached by the
negotiated rulemaking committee which, among other things, established uniform policies
limiting Medicare coverage for certain tests to patients with specified medical conditions
or diagnoses, replacing local Medicare coverage policies, which varied around the country.
Since the final rules generally became effective in 2002, the use of uniform policies has
improved the Company’s ability to obtain necessary billing information in some cases,
but Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements continue to
negatively impact the Company’s ability to be paid for some of these tests it
performs. Due to the range of payers and policies, the extent of this impact continues to
be difficult to quantify.

Future
changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of
current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could
have a material adverse effect on the Company. Based on currently available information,
the Company is unable to predict what type of changes in legislation or regulations, if
any, will occur.

Standard
Electronic Transactions, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information

The Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) was designed to
address issues related to the portability of health insurance. In an effort to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic
exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions, new
regulations were promulgated to protect the privacy and security of certain information.
These regulations apply to health plans, health care providers that conduct standard
transactions electronically and health care clearinghouses (“covered entities”).
Five such regulations have been finalized: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii)
the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the National Standard Employer Identifier
Rule, which requires the use of a unique employer identifier in connection with certain
electronic transactions; and (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule, which requires the
use of a unique health care provider identifier in connection with certain electronic
transactions.

The
Company’s HIPAA project plans have two phases: (i) assessment of current systems,
applications, processes and procedure testing and validation for HIPAA compliance and (ii)
remediation of affected systems, applications, processes and procedure testing and
validation for HIPAA compliance.

The
Transactions and Code Sets Rule standardizes the format and data content to be used in the
most common electronic health care transactions, including health care claims,
eligibility, and health care claim status. Its purpose is to encourage the use of
electronic exchanges while reducing the administrative burden associated with using
different formats. The compliance date for this rule was October 16, 2002; however,
covered entities (except small health plans) were permitted to file an extension plan with
HHS to extend the compliance date to October 16, 2003. The extension plan described how
the entity will come into compliance with the Transactions and Code Sets Rule requirements
by the compliance date. The Company and its subsidiaries filed such extension plans. HHS
announced contingency plans permitting entities unable to meet the compliance date to
continue to accept legacy claims after October 16, 2003. Continuation of the contingency
period will be determined by CMS based upon a regular assessment of the readiness of its
electronic “trading partners.” Although the Company is compliant, the Company is

(17)

operating under its own contingency
plan, pursuant to which it continues to work with payers who are not prepared to meet the
compliance date.

The
Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information
(“PHI”) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an
individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the
right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the
use or disclosure of PHI. Additionally, it requires covered entities to implement certain
administrative requirements, such as designating a privacy officer, drafting and
implementing privacy policies and procedures, and training workforce members. Health care
providers governed by the Privacy Rule were required to come into compliance by April 14,
2003.

In
light of the CMS Guidance and on-going contingency period, the Company believes that it is
in compliance in all material respects with the Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The
Company also believes that it is in compliance with all material provisions of the Privacy
Rule. In this regard, the Company has set up a hotline for the reporting of possible
violations. The total cost associated with the requirements of HIPAA is not expected to be
material to the Company’s operations or cash flows. There are, however, many
unresolved issues in both of these areas and future interpretations of HIPAA could impose
significant costs on the Company.

The
Company is in the assessment phase of the Security Rule. The Company expects to meet the
April 21, 2005 compliance date for the Security Rule.

In
addition to the federal HIPAA regulations described above, there are a number of state
laws regarding the confidentiality of medical information, some of which apply to clinical
laboratories. These laws vary widely, and new laws in this area are pending, but they most
commonly restrict the use and disclosure of medical information. Penalties for violation
of these laws include sanctions against a laboratory’s state licensure, as well as
civil and/or criminal penalties. Violations of the HIPAA provisions after the applicable
compliance dates could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant
fines and up to 10 years in prison.

Fraud
and Abuse Laws and Regulations

Existing
federal laws governing federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as
well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse
prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are
interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including
the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS’ Office of the Inspector General
(“OIG”), and various state agencies. Over the last several years, the clinical
laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The
federal government’s enforcement efforts have been increasing, in part as a result of
the enactment of HIPAA, which included several provisions related to fraud and abuse
enforcement, including the establishment of: a program to coordinate federal, state and
local law enforcement programs; a program to conduct greater numbers of investigations,
audits and inspections relating to payment for health care items and services; and a
federal anti-fraud and abuse account for enforcement efforts, funded through collection of
penalties and fines for violations of the health care anti-fraud and abuse laws.

The
federal health care programs antikickback law (the “antikickback law”) prohibits
knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce, the referral of
Medicare or Medicaid (or other federal healthcare program) business. Violations can result
in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health
care programs. HHS has published “safe harbor” regulations which specify certain
arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the antikickback law if all
conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does
not necessarily constitute a violation of the antikickback law; rather, the arrangement
would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a
case by case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid antikickback laws and several
states also have antikickback laws that apply to all payers (

i.e.

, not

(18)

just federal or state healthcare
programs).

From
time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the health
care industry. Several examples of such guidance documents are described below. In October
1994, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on arrangements for the provision of clinical
laboratory services. The Fraud Alert set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in
by some clinical laboratories and health care providers that raise issues under the
“fraud and abuse” laws, including the antikickback law. These practices include:
(i) laboratories providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other
than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of
the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services to renal dialysis
centers at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests which are
billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to a physician’s
managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such
reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous
waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v)
providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not
exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; and (vi) providing free
testing for health care providers, their families and their employees (professional
courtesy testing). The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alert that when one purpose of
an arrangement is to induce referrals of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the
clinical laboratory and the health care provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the
antikickback laws, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Another
issue the OIG is concerned about involves the provision of discounts on laboratory
services billed to customers in return for the referral of more lucrative federal health
care program business. In a 1999 Advisory Opinion, the OIG concluded that a proposed
arrangement whereby a laboratory would offer physicians significant discounts on
non-federal health care program laboratory tests might violate the antikickback act. The
OIG reasoned that the laboratory could be viewed as providing such discounts to the
physician in exchange for referrals by the physician of business to be billed by the
laboratory to Medicare at non-discounted rates. The OIG indicated that the arrangement
would not qualify for protection under the discount safe harbor because Medicare and
Medicaid would not get the benefit of the discount. Similarly, in 1999 correspondence, the
OIG stated that if any direct or indirect link exists between a discount that a laboratory
offers to a skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) for tests covered under the
Medicare Prospective Payment System (“PPS”) and referrals to the laboratory of
tests covered under Medicare Part B (i.e., not covered under a fixed PPS system), then the
antikickback statute would be implicated.

The
OIG also has issued two separate guidance documents regarding joint venture arrangements
that may be viewed as suspect under the antikickback law. These documents have relevance
to clinical laboratories that are part of (or are considering establishing) joint ventures
with potential referral sources. The first guidance document, which focused on investor
referrals to such ventures, was issued in 1989, and the more recent one, concerning
contractual joint ventures, was issued in April 2003. Some of the elements of joint
ventures that the OIG identified as “suspect” include: arrangements in which the
capital invested by the physicians is disproportionately small and the return on
investment is disproportionately large when compared to typical investment; specific
selection of investors who are in a position to make referrals to the venture; and
arrangements in which one of the parties to the joint venture expands into a line of
business that is dependent on referrals from the other party (sometimes called
“shell” joint ventures). In a recent advisory opinion, the OIG expressed concern
about a proposed joint venture in which a laboratory company would assist physician groups
in establishing off-site pathology laboratories. The OIG indicated that the
physicians’ financial and business risk in the venture was minimal and that the
physicians’ would contract out substantially all laboratory operations, committing
very little in the way of financial, capital, or human resources. The OIG was unable to
exclude the possibility that the arrangement was designed to permit the laboratory to pay
the physician groups for their referrals, and therefore was unwilling to find that the
arrangement fell within the safe harbor.

Violations
of other fraud and abuse laws also can result in exclusion from participation in federal
health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. One basis for such exclusion is an
individual or entity’s

(19)

submission of claims to Medicare or
Medicaid for items or services that are substantially in excess of that individual or
entity’s usual charges. In September 2003, the OIG issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking to amend the pertinent federal regulations. In this notice OIG proposed to
define, for the first time, the terms “substantially in excess” and “usual
charges,” and to clarify the meaning of “good cause” as an exception to
this exclusion authority. Under the proposed regulation, the Government would determine a
provider’s “usual charges” by looking at the provider’s charges to all
customers (with a few limited exceptions). This could result in the Company (and other
laboratory companies) needing to increase charges to managed care plans and other
customers so that its charges to Medicare are not “substantially in excess” of
its “usual charges.” This notice, which solicited comments, is only a proposal,
but if the regulation were to be amended as proposed, it could have an adverse effect on
the Company. At this time it is impossible to predict whether this proposed change in
regulations might be finalized and how any such final regulations might differ from the
notice of proposed rulemaking.

Under
another federal statute, known as the “Stark” law or “self-referral”
prohibition, physicians who have an investment or compensation relationship with a
clinical laboratory may not, unless a statutory exception applies, refer Medicare or
Medicaid patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties,
unless an exception applies. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or Medicaid or
any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. There are
several Stark law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical
laboratories, including: 1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or
services; 2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; 3)
an exception for certain ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided
within the referring physician’s own office, if various criteria are met; 4)
physician investment in a company so long as the company’s stock is traded on a
public exchange and the company has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and 5)
certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate
and meet other requirements. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met
in order to take advantage of the exception. Many states have their own self-referral laws
as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just Medicare and
Medicaid.

There
are a variety of other types of federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, including
laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Company seeks to conduct
its business in compliance with all federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws. However,
the Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no
assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such
laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in
Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil
fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a federal
healthcare program, or any loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or
state regulatory or enforcement authority, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting
from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Environmental,
Health and Safety

The
Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety of
laboratory employees and laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and
disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.
All Company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations
relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens and the Company generally
utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive
requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical
laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the
hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls,
protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other
measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

November 6, 2000, Congress passed the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act which
required, among other things, that companies include in their safety programs the
evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective
at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. During 2001, the Company
voluntarily implemented the use of safety needles at all of its service locations at a
cost of approximately $6.0 million.

Although
the Company is not aware of any current material non-compliance with such federal, state
and local laws and regulations, failure to comply could subject the Company to denial of
the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions.

Drug
Testing

Drug
testing for public sector employees is regulated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (“SAMHSA”) (formerly the National Institute on Drug
Abuse), which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories
must meet to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of federal government
contractors and certain other entities. To the extent that the Company’s laboratories
perform such testing, each must be certified as meeting SAMHSA standards. The
Company’s Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Raritan, New Jersey; Houston,
Texas; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington and Southaven, Mississippi laboratories
are SAMHSA certified.

Controlled
Substances

The
use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration.

Compliance Program

Because
of evolving interpretations of regulations and the national debate over health care fraud
and abuse, compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other government-established rules
and regulations has become a significant issue throughout the clinical laboratory
industry. The Company has implemented a comprehensive company-wide compliance program. The
objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement, and update
compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing compliance policies
and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to
attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.

In
2001, DIANON settled a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into several of
DIANON’s billing practices. As part of the settlement, DIANON entered into a
voluntary corporate integrity program. As part of DIANON’s acquisition of UroCor
Inc., DIANON assumed responsibility and liability for compliance with the UroCor corporate
integrity agreement.

The
Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and
other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The clinical
laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of
these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no
assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a
prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely effect
the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include
significant fines and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

All
of the Company’s primary laboratory facilities have been built or improved for the
single purpose of providing clinical laboratory testing services. The Company believes
that these facilities are suitable and adequate and have sufficient production capacity
for its currently foreseeable level of operations. The Company believes that if it were
unable to renew a lease or if a lease were to be terminated on any of the facilities it
presently leases, it could find alternate space at competitive market rates and readily
relocate its operations to such new locations without material disruption to its
operations.

(22)

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On
June 24, 2003, the Company and certain of its executive officers were sued in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in the first of a series
of putative shareholder class actions alleging securities fraud. Since that date, at least
five other complaints containing substantially identical allegations have been filed
against the Company and certain of the Company’s executive officers. Each of the
complaints alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making
material misstatements and/or omissions that caused the price of the Company’s stock
to be artificially inflated between February 13 and October 3, 2002. The plaintiffs seek
certification of a class of substantially all persons who purchased shares of the
Company’s stock during that time period and unspecified monetary damages. These six
cases have been consolidated and will proceed as a single case. On July 16, 2004, the
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. The defendants
deny any liability and continue to defend the case vigorously. At this time, it is
premature to make any assessment of the potential outcome of the cases or whether they
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

The
Company is the appellant in a patent case originally filed by Competitive Technologies,
Inc. and Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment against the
Company for patent infringement, with total damages and attorney’s fees payable by
the Company of approximately $7.8 million. The Company vigorously contested the judgment
and appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On
June 8, 2004, that court affirmed the judgment against the Company and, on August 5, 2004,
the Company’s request for rehearing was denied. On November 3, 2004, the Company
filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. The
underlying judgment has been paid and, on January 25, 2005, the United States Court of
Appeal for the Federal Circuit confirmed the attorneys’ fees portion of the judgment.
The Company has filed a request to stay the award of attorneys’ fees pending the
resolution of the Company’s appeal to the United States Supreme Court. On February
28, 2005, the United States Supreme Court requested the Solicitor General to file a brief
expressing the views of the United States on the issue of whether the laws of nature,
natural phenomena and abstract ideas can be patented. The Company plans to continue to
vigorously contest the judgment until it exhausts all reasonable appellate rights.

The
Company is also involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. These matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property
disputes, professional liability, employee related matters, and inquiries from
governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid payers and managed care payers requesting
comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention
through billing audits or third parties. In the opinion of management, based upon the
advice of counsel and consideration of all facts available at this time, the ultimate
disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. The Company is also
named from time to time in suits brought under the

qui tam

provisions of the False
Claims Act. These suits typically allege that the Company has made false statements and/or
certifications in connection with claims for payment from federal health care programs.
They may remain under seal (hence, unknown to the Company) for some time while the
government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the

qui tam

plaintiff. Such
claims are an inevitable part of doing business in the health care field today and, in the
opinion of management, based upon the advice of counsel and consideration of all facts
available at this time, the ultimate disposition of those

qui tam

matters presently
known to the Company is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes,
regulations and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The
clinical laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the
courts have not interpreted many of these statutes and regulations. There can be no
assurance therefore that those applicable statutes and regulations might not be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner
that would adversely

(23)

affect the Company. Potential
sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and
the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations.

Under
the Company’s present insurance programs, coverage is obtained for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company is
responsible for the uninsured portion of losses related primarily to general, professional
and vehicle liability, certain medical costs and workers’ compensation. The
self-insured retentions are on a per occurrence basis without any aggregate annual limit.
Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon the
Company’s estimates of the aggregated liability of claims incurred. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the Company had provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $63.5
and $57.1 respectively, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs.

(a)    
          On January 17, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
          outstanding shares of DIANON Systems, Inc. for $47.50 per share in cash, or
          approximately $595.6 million including transaction fees and expenses. See
          “Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for further
          discussion of this acquisition. The Company recorded net restructuring and other
          special charges of $1.5 million for 2003 in connection with the integrations of
          its recent acquisitions.

(b)    
          On July 25, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
          outstanding stock of Dynacare Inc. in a combination cash and stock transaction
          with a combined value of approximately $496.4 million, including transaction
          costs. See “Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for
          further discussion of this acquisition. During the third quarter of 2002, the
          Company recorded restructuring and other special charges totaling $17.5 million.
          These charges included a special bad debt provision of approximately $15.0
          million related to the acquired Dynacare accounts receivable balance and
          restructuring expense of

(28)

approximately $2.5 million relating
to Dynacare integration costs of actions that impact the Company’s existing employees
and operations.

(c)    
          Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. This
          Standard requires that goodwill and other intangibles that are acquired in
          business combinations and that have indefinite useful lives are not to be
          amortized.

(d)    
          During the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a loss of $5.5 million
          relating to the write-off of unamortized bank fees associated with the
          Company’s term debt, which was repaid in September of 2001. The Company
          also recorded a charge of $8.9 million as a result of a payment made to a bank
          to terminate an interest rate swap agreement tied to the Company’s term
          loan.

(e)    
          In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $4.5 million restructuring
          charge relating to the closing of its Memphis drug testing facility.

(f)    
          In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the
          Financial Accounting Standards Board reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-8,
          “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per
          Share.” Under the EITF’s conclusion, contingently convertible shares
          attached to a debt instrument are to be included in the calculation of diluted
          earnings per share regardless of whether or not the contingency has been met.
          Historically the Company followed the guidance of paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 128,
          “Earnings Per Share”, and excluded contingently convertible shares
          relating to its zero coupon – subordinated notes from its calculations of
          diluted earnings per share. The EITF consensus supersedes the accounting under
          SFAS No. 128 and, accordingly, the Company has adopted the provisions of EITF No
          04-8 for its zero coupon-subordinated notes — including the retroactive
          restatement of all diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods
          presented. See “Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
          information regarding calculation of Earnings per Share. Diluted earnings per
          share as previously stated were $2.22, $1.77, $1.27, and $0.80 for the years
          ended 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Diluted weighted average shares
          outstanding were 144.8, 144.2, 141.1,and 96.3 for 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
          respectively.

(g)    
          Long-term obligations primarily include capital lease obligations of $2.9
          million, $4.4 million, $5.5 million, $6.1 million and $7.2 million at December
          31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Long-term obligations exclude
          amounts due to affiliates. On June 6, 2000, the Company called for redemption
          all of its outstanding redeemable preferred stock, resulting in the conversion
          of substantially all of the preferred stock into common stock. During 2001, the
          Company sold $744.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of its zero
          coupon convertible subordinated notes due 2021 in a private placement. The
          Company received approximately $488.6 million in net proceeds from the offering.
          The Company used a portion of the proceeds to repay $412.5 million of its term
          loan outstanding under its credit agreement.

Item 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

During
2004, the Company continued to strengthen its financial performance through the
implementation of the Company’s strategic plan and the expansion of its national
platform in routine testing. This plan continues to provide growth opportunities for the
Company by building a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing
technologies primarily through internal development efforts, acquisitions and technology
licensing activities.

The
Company’s Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology, located in Research Triangle
Park, NC is a leader in the development and application of molecular diagnostics and
polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, technologies in the areas of diagnostic genetics,
oncology and infectious disease. The Company believes that these technologies may
represent a significant savings to the healthcare system by increasing the detection of
early stage (treatable) diseases. The Company’s National Genetics Institute in Los
Angeles, CA, develops novel, highly-sensitive PCR methods used to test for hepatitis C and
other infectious agents and is the only laboratory in the U.S. that is FDA-approved to
screen plasma for infectious diseases. Viro-Med Laboratories, Inc., based in Minneapolis,
MN, offers molecular microbial testing using real-time PCR platforms and provides
significant additional capacity to support the continued expansion of the Company’s
advanced testing business. These Centers of Excellence enable the Company to provide a
broad menu of testing services for the infectious disease and cancer markets, which the
Company believes represent two of the most significant areas of future growth in the
clinical laboratory industry.

The
Dynacare integration has been completed and is performing as expected, including the
achievement of the planned total synergy savings of approximately $45 million. Dynacare
continues to strengthen the Company’s national network of routine testing. The DIANON
integration has been completed and is performing as expected, including the achievement of
the planned total synergy savings of approximately $32 million. The Company began applying
DIANON’s standardized anatomic pathology processes in early 2004. To date, four major
sites have been “DIANIZED”. By the end of 2006, the Company expects to have
nearly 80 percent of all our anatomic pathology work “DIANIZED”.

Effective
February 3, 2005, the Company completed its purchase of US LABS, a well respected provider
of anatomic pathology and oncology testing located in Irvine, California. US LABS’
sales were approximately $70 million in 2004. This acquisition increases the
Company’s capabilities in the cancer testing market and provides additional lab
capacity on the West Coast.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a multi-year agreement with Cytyc for
their ThinPrep Imaging System. The ThinPrep Imaging System is the first fully integrated,
interactive computer system that assists cytotechnologists and pathologists in the primary
screening and diagnosis of ThinPrep Pap Test slides. The company intends to implement this
state-of-the-art cervical cancer screening instrument by mid-2005.

The
Company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors: 1) The
expansion of higher-value genomic tests such as Cystic Fibrosis, HCV and HIV genotyping,
along with the continued growth of HIV viral load and HPV testing; 2) Transition to
Cytyc’s ThinPrep Imaging System; 3) Continued progress with existing licensing and
business relationships (such as EXACT Sciences, Correlogic and BioPredictive); 4) The
Company’s ongoing business acquisition strategy; and 5) Growing demand for genomic
testing creating a positive shift in test mix toward higher value testing.

On
October 20, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized and announced a stock
repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to an aggregate of $250.0
million of its common stock from time-to-time. It is the Company’s intention to fund
future purchases of its common stock with cash flow from operations.

(30)

Seasonality

Volume
of testing generally declines during the year-end holiday periods and other major
holidays. In addition, volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues
and cash flows. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not
accurately reflect trends or results for the full year.

Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2004
compared with Year ended December 31, 2003.

Net
sales for 2004 were $3,084.8 million, an increase of 4.9% from $2,939.4 million reported
in the comparable 2003 period. Testing volume growth, measured by accessions, increased
approximately 3.6% (primarily volume growth in genomic and esoteric testing of
approximately 9.8% as well as volume growth of approximately 2.5% in the core business).
Price per accession increased approximately 1.3% compared to 2003.

Cost
of sales, which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs, was $1,795.5 million
for 2004 compared to $1,714.8 million in 2003, an increase of 4.7%. The increase in cost
of sales is primarily the result of increases in volume discussed above. Cost of sales as
a percentage of net sales was 58.2% for 2004 and 58.3% in 2003.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased to $649.1 million in 2004 from $651.8
million in 2003 representing a decrease of $2.7 million or 0.4%. As a percentage of net
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 21.0% and 22.1% for the year
ended 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease in selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales is a result of the Company’s cost control
initiatives, as well as a reduced effective bad debt expense rate resulting from improved
billing and collection performance.

The
amortization of intangibles and other assets was $42.7 million and $37.6 million for 2004
and 2003, respectively. The increase in amortization expense is a result of licensed
technology and other small business acquisitions.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded certain adjustments to previously
recorded restructuring charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of
approximately of $0.9 million. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a
pre-tax restructuring charge of $3.3 million in connection with the integration of DIANON.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $3.1 million, relating
to the continuing integration of its recent acquisitions. The Company also recorded
certain adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2003 to previously recorded restructuring
charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of approximately $4.9 million.

Interest
expense was $36.1 million in 2004 compared to $40.9 million in 2003. This decrease was a
direct result of debt reductions following the Company’s financing of the DIANON
acquisition in 2003.

Income
from investments in joint venture partnerships was $51.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to $43.7 million for the year end December 31, 2003. This
income represents the Company’s ownership share in joint venture partnerships
acquired as part of the Dynacare acquisition on July 25, 2002. A significant portion of
this income is derived from investments in Ontario and Alberta, Canada, and is earned in
Canadian dollars. The strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during
the year ended December 31, 2004 has had a positive impact on this income as well as the
cash generated from the Canadian investments.

The
provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before taxes was 41.0% in 2004
compared to

(31)

40.6% in 2003. The increase in the
effective tax rate for 2004 is due to a $2.1 million state tax recovery during the third
quarter of 2003.

Year ended December 31, 2003
compared with Year ended December 31, 2002.

Net
sales for 2003 were $2,939.4 million, an increase of 17.2% from $2,507.7 million reported
in the comparable 2002 period. Testing volume growth, measured by accessions, increased
approximately 11.7% and was affected by the acquisitions of Dynacare and DIANON as well as
growth in the Company’s esoteric test volumes (including HPV and cystic fibrosis).
Price per accession increased approximately 5.5% compared to 2002. The growth in price was
affected by this same shift in test mix and from shifts in histology testing which is
primarily DIANON-related. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of severe
winter weather during the first quarter of 2003 and physician strikes to protest rising
malpractice insurance rates during the second quarter.

Cost
of sales, which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs, was $1,714.8 million
for 2003 compared to $1,445.9 million in 2002, an increase of 18.6%. The increase in cost
of sales is primarily the result of increases in volume and supplies due to recent
acquisitions, growth in the base business and growth in esoteric and genomic testing (with
significant increases in cystic fibrosis and HPV testing). Cost of sales as a percentage
of net sales was 58.3% for 2003 and 57.7% in 2002, reflecting the additional
infrastructure costs (facilities and personnel) of Dynacare and DIANON acquisitions.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased to $651.8 million in 2003 from $585.5
million in 2002 representing an increase of $66.3 million or 11.3%. This increase resulted
primarily from personnel and other costs as a result of the recent acquisitions. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.1% and 23.3%
for the year ended 2003 and 2002, respectively, reflecting the realization of synergies
from the Dynacare and DIANON acquisitions, as well as the Company’s reduction of its
bad debt expense rate by approximately 130 basis points during 2003 as compared to 2002.

The
amortization of intangibles and other assets was $37.6 million and $23.8 million for 2003
and 2002, respectively. The increase in amortization expense is a result of the
acquisitions of Dynacare and DIANON.

The
Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.3 million and $17.5 million during
the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively, in connection with the integrations of
DIANON and Dynacare, Inc. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge
of $3.1 million, relating to the continuing integration of its recent acquisitions. The
Company also recorded certain adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2003 to previously
recorded restructuring charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of
approximately $4.8 million.

Interest
expense was $40.9 million in 2003 compared to $19.2 million in 2002. This increase was a
direct result of the Company’s financing of the DIANON acquisition.

Income
from joint venture partnerships was $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to $13.4 million for the year end December 31, 2002. This income represents the
Company’s ownership share in joint venture partnerships acquired as part of the
Dynacare acquisition on July 25, 2002. A significant portion of this income is derived
from investments in Ontario and Alberta, Canada, and is earned in Canadian dollars. The
strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the year ended December
31, 2003 has had a positive impact on this income as well as the cash generated from the
Canadian investments.

The
provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before taxes was 40.6% in 2003
compared to 41.1% in 2002. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2003 is due to a
$2.1 million state tax recovery during the third quarter of 2003.

(32)

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $538.1 million, $564.3 million and $444.9
million, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flow from operations in 2004 was less
than 2003 due to approximately $50 million of one-time tax credits that were realized in
2003. Improvements in cash flow from operations primarily resulted from improved earnings,
the expansion of the business through acquisitions, and the improvement of the
Company’s accounts receivable days’ sales outstanding (“DSO”) to 52
days at the end of 2004 from 53 days at the end of 2003. This improvement was due to
Company-wide efforts to increase cash collections from all payers, as well as on-going
improvements to the claim submission processes. In addition, the Company continued to take
steps necessary to improve DSO and cash collections by:

1)

conversion of decentralized billing locations, including former Dynacare
               locations, to a centralized billing system. During 2003, billing activity in
               numerous Dynacare sites was converted to the centralized billing system. In
               2004, the Company substantially completed its conversion activities on the
               remaining Dynacare locations as well as its Salt Lake City, Reno, San Diego and
               Viro-Med facilities.

2)

continuing an initiative to reduce the number of requisitions received that are
               missing certain billing information. This initiative involves counting the
               number of clinical requisitions received from an ordering client, as well as
               determining what specific information was not provided. The Company then
               identifies root causes of why the information was missing and takes steps to
               ensure that information is provided in the future. These steps include
               re-educating clients as to what information is needed in order for the Company
               to bill and collect for the test.

3)

implementation of numerous initiatives related to self-pay accounts receivable.
               These include: i) collecting payment at the time of service; ii) increased
               training for billing personnel related to improving collections during phone
               calls and iii) review of bill design and frequency.

The
Company utilizes a centralized billing system in the collection of substantially all of
its accounts receivable. This system generates bills to customers based on the payer type.
Client billing is typically generated monthly, whereas patient and third party billing are
typically generated on a daily basis. Agings of accounts receivable are then monitored by
billing personnel and re-bills and follow-up activities are conducted as necessary. Bad
debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts
at an appropriate level, based on the Company’s experience with its accounts
receivable. The Company writes off accounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts
when they are deemed to be uncollectible. For client billing, accounts are written off
when all reasonable collection efforts prove to be unsuccessful. Patient accounts are
written off after the normal dunning cycle has occurred and the account has been
transferred to a third party collection agency. Third party and managed care accounts are
written off when they exceed the payer’s timely filing limits.

Capital
expenditures were $95.0 million, $83.6 million and $74.3 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. During 2004, the Company accelerated capital projects relating to its new
financial system, and projects supporting its strategic initiatives centered around
customer retention, scientific differentiation and managed care. The Company expects
capital expenditures of approximately $110.0 to $125.0 million in 2005. The Company will
continue to make important investments in information technology connectivity with its
customers and financial systems. Such expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow
from operations as well as borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit
facilities.

In
conjunction with the acquisition of DIANON, the Company’s planned financing of the
acquisition, and announced share repurchase plan, Standard and Poor’s lowered its
overall rating on the Company to BBB from BBB+ and Moody’s issued a Baa3 rating to
the Company’s Senior Notes.

On
January 13, 2005, the Company entered into a $350.0 senior credit facility with Credit
Suisse First Boston and UBS Securities LLC, acting as Co-Lead Arrangers, and a group of
financial institutions. This

(33)

new five year credit facility
replaced the existing $150.0 364-day revolving credit facility and the $200.0 three-year
revolving credit facility which was amended on January 14, 2003 and was scheduled to
expire on February 18, 2005. This credit facility bears interest at varying rates based
upon the Company’s credit rating with Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.
The new facility also provides for an accordion feature to increase the facility up to an
additional $150 million, with the consent of the lenders, if needed to support the
Company’s growth. There were no balances outstanding on the Company’s senior
credit facilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

On
January 17, 2003, in conjunction with the acquisition of DIANON, the Company borrowed
$350.0 million under the DIANON Bridge Loan Agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston,
acting as Administrative Agent. On January 31, 2003, the Company sold $350.0 million
aggregate principal amount of its 5 ½% Senior Notes due February 1, 2013. Proceeds
from the issuance of these Notes ($345.1 million), together with cash on hand was used to
repay the $350.0 million principal amount of the Company’s bridge loan facility, and
as a result, the loan was terminated. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution, solely to
manage its interest rate exposure on $175.0 million of its 5 ½% Senior Notes. This
swap agreement was terminated during June 2003 and resulted in net proceeds to the Company
of $5.3 million.

On
September 11, 2004, no holders of its zero coupon-subordinated notes elected to exercise
their option to redeem their notes.

On
February 3, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of US LABS for approximately $155
million in cash on hand.

Pension Funding

During
2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company made contributions to its defined pension plan in the
amounts of $60.0 million, $18.3 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The Company
expects to contribute $24.0 million to its defined pension plan during 2005. See
“Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further discussion of
the Company’s pension and postretirement plans.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In
December 2004 the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued FAS 123(R),

Share-Based Payment (revised 2004)

. This Statement is a revision of FASB Statement
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based

Compensation. This Statement supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and its related
implementation guidance. This Statement establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It
also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or
services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The Company has not finalized
what, if any, changes may be made to its equity compensation plans in light of the
accounting change, and therefore is not yet in a position to quantify its impact. The
Company expects to announce the impact in connection with reporting its second quarter
2005 financial results. The impact on cash from operations of adopting the new accounting
standard cannot be estimated at this time. See “Note 1 to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for proforma impact of expensing all equity-based compensation, which the
Company believes would approximate the annual effect of adopting the new accounting
standard.

This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which
an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. This Statement
does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties
other than employees provided in Statement 123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No.
96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.” This Statement does
not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA
Statement of Position 93-6,

Employers’ Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership
Plans.

(34)

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

. This
Statement amends the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.

That statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in
that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement
amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception to for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. The Company has not historically entered into a significant level
of nonmonetary transactions and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact
is financial position or results unless nonmonetary transactions are utilized in the
future. This statement is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005.

Contractual Cash
Obligations

(a)

Contingent future licensing payments will be made if certain events take place,
               such as the launch of a specific test, the transfer of certain technology, and
               when specified revenue milestones are met.

(b)

Holders of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may require the Company to
               purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2006 and 2011
               at prices ranging from $741.92 to $819.54 per note. Should the holders put the
               notes to the Company on any of the dates above, the Company believes that it
               will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand, borrowings
               on the revolving credit facility, and additional financing if necessary.

(c)

The table does not include obligations under the Company’s pension and
               postretirement benefit plans which are included in “Note 21 to Consolidated
               Financial Statements.” The Company expects to contribute approximately $24
               million to its defined pension plan during 2005, although it is not legally
               required to do so. Benefits under the Company’s postretirement medical plan
               are made when claims are submitted for payment, the timing of which are not
               practicable to estimate.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

The
Company does not have transactions or relationships with “special purpose”
entities, and the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal
operating leases.

(35)

Other Commercial
Commitments

At
December 31, 2004, the Company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $63.5
million, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. These letters of credit
are secured by the Company’s senior credit facilities and are renewed annually,
around mid-year.

Based
on current and projected levels of operations, coupled with availability under its new
senior credit facilities, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both
its short-term and long-term cash needs. For a discussion of the Company’s zero
coupon-subordinated notes, see “Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
For a discussion of the Company’s new senior credit facilities, see “Note 13 to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Critical Accounting
Policies

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported periods. Significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful
accounts, pension expense, amortization lives for intangible assets, accruals for
self-insurance reserves, income taxes and reserves for professional liability claims.

Allowances
for doubtful accounts

Revenue
is recognized for services rendered when test results are reported to the ordering
physician and the testing process is complete. The Company’s sales are generally
billed to three types of payers – clients, patients and third parties, such as
managed care companies, Medicare and Medicaid. For clients, sales are recorded on a
fee-for-service basis at the Company’s client list price, less any negotiated
discount. Patient sales are recorded at the Company’s patient fee schedule, net of
any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. The Company bills
third party payers in two ways – fee-for-service and capitated agreements.
Fee-for-service third party payers are billed at the Company’s patient fee schedule
amount, and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. These discounts
are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is
maintained for each third party payer. The majority of the Company’s third party
sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale. For the
remaining third party sales, estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer.
Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection
and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue. These adjustments are not
material to the Company’s results of operations in any period presented. The Company
periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends.
Under capitated agreements with managed care companies, the Company recognizes revenue
based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan
regardless of the number or costs of services performed.

The
Company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables
based on the period of time they have been outstanding. Bad debt expense is recorded
within selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered
necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level. The
Company’s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful
accounts involves judgment, and considers such factors as the age of the underlying
receivables, historical and projected collection experience, and other external factors
that could affect the collectibility of its receivables. Accounts are written off against
the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s write off policy (e.g.
when they are deemed to be uncollectible). In the determination of the appropriate level
of the allowance, accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of
cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the Company’s
receivables. These collection and reserve processes, along with the close monitoring of
the billing process, help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates
resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience.

Pension
Expense.

The Company’s net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations.
Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected
return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year.
The Company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in
interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension costs may occur in the
future due to changes in these assumptions. The key assumptions used in accounting for the
defined benefit plans were a 6.0% discount rate and an 8.5% expected return on plan assets
as of December 31, 2004.

In
establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the Company reviews asset
allocation considering plan maturity and develops return assumptions based on different
asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. Actual asset over/under performance
compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. The
change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. A one
percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have
resulted in a change in pension expense of approximately $1.7 million.

Current
year net pension cost was $11.3 million, a decrease of $4.9 million from 2003. Our
actuaries have estimated that 2005 net pension cost should be comparable to or slightly
less than fiscal 2004 net pension cost. Favorable asset performance in 2004 and
contributions to plan assets will cause a reduction in net pension cost for fiscal 2005.
However, the decrease in the discount rate assumption during fiscal 2004 will cause an
offsetting increase in net pension cost for 2005.

Accruals
for Self-insurance Reserves.

Accruals
for self-insurance reserves (including workers’ compensation, auto and employee
medical) are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history, along with
current and estimated future economic conditions.

The Company is self-insured for professional liability claims arising in
the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of
laboratory test results. The Company records an accrual for such claims payable and claims
incurred but not reported based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by
frequency and amounts of claims, which is performed at least annually.

While
management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very
nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from these estimates. The Company’s Audit Committee periodically
reviews the Company’s significant accounting policies. See “Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of significant accounting
policies.

(37)

Income
Taxes.

The
Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this
method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax
benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not.

(38)

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

The
Company has made in this report, and from time to time may otherwise make in its public
filings, press releases and discussions by Company management, forward-looking statements
concerning the Company’s operations, performance and financial condition, as well as
its strategic objectives. Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by
the use of forward-looking words such as “believes”, “expects”,
“may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”,
“approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates”,
or “anticipates” or the negative of those words or other comparable terminology.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and the
Company claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The
Company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated
with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has
included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate
swap agreements. The Company had an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial
institution, solely to manage its interest rate exposure on $175.0 million of its 5
½% senior notes. This swap agreement was terminated during June 2003 and the
Company received net proceeds of $5.3 million. Although, as set forth below, the
Company’s zero coupon-subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be
embedded derivative instruments, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. The Company does not believe that its exposure to market
risk is material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The Company’s zero
coupon-subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be
embedded derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133:

1)

The Company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon-subordinated
                    notes after September 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals
                    120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and
                    contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period.

Code of Ethics, Experts

Guidelines (the “Guidelines). The Guidelines address a number of topics, including
director independence, Board and Committee self-assessment, retirement, evaluation of the
Chief Executive Officer, composition of the Board and succession planning. The Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Guidelines on a regular basis and any
proposed additions or amendments to the Guidelines are submitted to the Board for its
consideration.

In
December 2003, the Board adopted the Company’s updated Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics (the “Code”). The Code is a code of business conduct and ethics
applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company, including its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, Controller and other senior financial
officers. The Code sets forth Company policies and expectations on a number of topics,
including but not limited to, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, compliance with laws
(including insider trading laws), preservation and use of Company assets, and business
ethics. The Code also sets forth procedures for communicating and handling any potential
conflict of interest (or the appearance of any conflict of interest) involving directors
or executive officers, and for the confidential communication and handling of issues
regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters. The Company regularly
reviews the Code and proposed additions or amendments to the Code are considered and
subject to approval by the Board.

In
order to provide stockholders with greater knowledge regarding the Board’s processes,
the Guidelines and the Code adopted by the Board of Directors are posted on the
Company’s website at www.labcorp.com. In addition, any waivers or amendments to the
Code will be posted on the Company’s website.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings:

We
have completed an integrated audit of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings’
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Laboratory Corporation
of America Holdings and its subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also,
in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004
based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that

(F-2)

receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

1. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Financial
Statement Presentation:

Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings with its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is the
second largest independent clinical laboratory company in the United States based on 2004
net revenues. Through a national network of laboratories, the Company offers a broad range
of testing services used by the medical profession in routine testing, patient diagnosis,
and in the monitoring and treatment of disease. In addition, the Company has developed
specialty and niche businesses based on certain types of specialized testing capabilities
and client requirements, such as oncology testing, HIV genotyping and phenotyping,
diagnostic genetics and clinical research trials.

Since
its founding in 1971, the Company has grown into a network of 32 primary laboratories and
over 1,300 service sites consisting of branches, patient service centers and STAT
laboratories. With approximately 23,500 employees, the Company processes tests on more
than 355,000 patient specimens daily and provides clinical laboratory testing services in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and two provinces in Canada. The
Company operates in one business segment.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries for which it exercises control. Long-term investments in
affiliated companies in which the Company owns greater than 20%, and therefore exercises
significant influence, but which it does not control, are accounted for using the equity
method. Investments in which the Company does not exercise significant influence
(generally, when the Company has an investment of less than 20% and no representation on
the Company’s Board of Directors) are accounted for using the cost method. All
significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company does
not have any variable interest entities or special purpose entities whose financial
results are not included in the consolidated financial statements.

On
January 17, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Dianon, a leading provider of
anatomic pathology and oncology testing services. On July 25, 2002, the Company completed
the acquisition of Dynacare, a provider of clinical laboratory testing services.
Disclosure of certain business combination transactions is included in Notes 2 and 3
– Business Acquisitions.

The
financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at
exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting translation
adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive earnings”.

Cash Equivalents:

Cash
equivalents (primarily investments in money market funds, time deposits, commercial paper
and Eurodollars which have original maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase) are carried at cost which approximates market.

Short-Term Investments:

Short-term
investments (U.S. Government Agency securities with original maturities between six and
twelve months) are carried at cost which approximates market. It is the intent of the
Company to hold these investments until they mature or are called by the issuer.

Inventories:

Inventories,
consisting primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

Derivative Financial
Instruments:

Interest
rate swap agreements, which have been used by the Company from time to time in the
management of interest rate exposure, are accounted for at fair value. Amounts to be paid
or received under such agreements are recognized as interest income or expense in the
periods in which they accrue.

The
Company’s zero coupon-subordinated notes contain the following two features that are
considered to be embedded derivative instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”:

1)

The Company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon subordinated
          notes after September 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals
          120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and
          contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period.

2)

Holders may surrender zero coupon-subordinated notes for conversion during any
          period in which the rating assigned to the zero coupon-subordinated notes by
          Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services is BB- or lower.

Based
upon independent appraisals, these embedded derivatives had no fair market value at
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of properties held under capital leases
is equal to the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair
value of the leased property at the inception of the lease. Depreciation and amortization
expense is computed on all classes of assets based on their estimated useful lives, as
indicated below, using principally the straight-line method.

Leasehold
improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated lives or the term of the related leases. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Retirements, sales and other disposals
of assets are recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation from the related
accounts with any resulting gain or loss reflected in operations.

Capitalized Software
Costs:

The Company capitalizes purchased software which is ready for service and capitalizes
software development costs incurred on significant projects starting from the time that
the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to funding a project
until the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended
use. Capitalized costs include direct material and service costs and payroll and
payroll-related costs. Research and development costs and other computer software
maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred. Capitalized
software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the underlying system, generally five years.

Debt Issuance Costs:

The
costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense
using the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt.

Professional Liability:

The
Company is self-insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of
business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. The
Company records a reserve for such asserted and estimated unasserted claims based on
actuarial assessments of future settlement and legal defense costs.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments:

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes
receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their respective
fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair market value of the zero
coupon-subordinated notes, based on market pricing, was approximately $501.3 and $465.6 as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Concentration of Credit
Risk:

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. The
total cash balances on deposit that exceeded the balances insured by the F.D.I.C., were
approximately $170.7 at December 31, 2004. Cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, totaled
$157.0, which includes amounts invested in treasury bills and short-term bonds.

Substantially
all of the Company’s accounts receivable are with companies and individuals in the
health care industry. However, concentrations of credit risk are limited due to the number
of the Company’s clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic
regions.

Accounts
receivable balances (gross) from Medicare and Medicaid were $107.9 and $100.4 at December
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Revenue Recognition:

Sales
are recognized on the accrual basis at the time test results are reported, which
approximates when services are provided. Services are provided to certain patients covered
by various third-party payer programs including the Managed Care, and Medicare and
Medicaid programs. Billings for services under third-party payer programs are included in
sales net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances for differences between
the amounts billed and estimated program payment amounts. Adjustments to the estimated
payment amounts based on final settlement with the programs are recorded upon settlement
as an adjustment to revenue. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 20%, 19%, and 16%,
respectively of the Company’s revenues were derived

from tests performed for
the beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company has capitated
agreements with certain managed care customers and recognizes related revenue based on a
predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless
of the number or cost of services provided by the Company. In 2004, 2003 and 2002,
approximately 4%, 4%, and 5%, respectively of the Company’s revenues were derived

from these capitated agreements.

Income Taxes:

The
Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this
method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates

(F-12)

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax benefits, such as net
operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such
benefits is more likely than not.

Stock Splits:

On
May 10, 2002, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split through the issuance of a
stock dividend of one new share of common stock for each share of common stock held by
shareholders of record on May 3, 2002. All references to common stock, common shares
outstanding, average number of common shares outstanding, stock options, restricted shares
and per share amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements have been restated to reflect common stock splits and the reverse
split on a retroactive basis.

Stock Compensation Plans:

The
Company accounts for its employee stock option plans using the intrinsic method under APB
Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations. Accordingly, compensation for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at
the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The
Company’s employee stock purchase plan is also accounted for under APB Opinion No. 25
and is treated as non-compensatory.

The
Company applies the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its employee stock
option and stock purchase plans and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for these plans in the financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation cost
based on the fair value method as defined in SFAS No. 123, the impact on the
Company’s net earnings on a pro forma basis is indicated below:

The
pro forma weighted average fair values at date of grant for options issued during 2004,
2003 and 2002 were $13.66, $13.43 and $23.50 respectively, and were estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Weighted average assumption for the expected life in
years were 3 years, 7 years and 7

(F-13)

years for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. Weighted average assumptions for the volatility and
dividend yield were .5 and 0% for each of the three years ended December 31, 2004.
Interest rate assumptions were 3.5%, 3.2% and 3.0% for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Compensation cost for restricted stock awards is recorded by
allocating their aggregate grant date fair value over their vesting period.

Earnings per Share:

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings, less preferred stock dividends
and accretion, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings including the impact of dilutive
adjustments by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially
dilutive shares, as if they had been issued at the beginning of the period presented.
Potentially dilutive common shares result primarily from the Company’s outstanding
stock options, restricted stock awards, and shares issuable upon conversion of zero-coupon
subordinated notes.

The
following represents a reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per
share: (shares in millions)

The
following table summarizes the potential common shares not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because their impact would have been antidilutive:

In
September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-8, “The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.” Under the EITF’s
conclusion, contingently convertible shares attached to a debt instrument are to be
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share regardless of whether or not the
contingency has been met. Historically the Company followed the guidance of paragraph 30
of SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”, and excluded contingently convertible
shares relating to its zero coupon – subordinated notes from its calculations of
diluted earnings per share. The EITF consensus supersedes the accounting under SFAS No.
128 and, accordingly, the Company has adopted the provisions of EITF No 04-8 for its zero
coupon-subordinated notes — including the retroactive restatement of all diluted
earnings per share calculations for all periods presented. Diluted earnings per share as
previously stated were $2.22, and $1.77 for the years ended 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 144.8 and 144.2 for 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Use of Estimates:

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported periods. Significant estimates include the

(F-14)

LABORATORY CORPORATION
OF AMERICA HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

allowances for doubtful accounts and
deferred tax assets, amortization lives for intangible assets and accruals for
self-insurance reserves. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on
historical collection trends, the aging of accounts, current economic conditions and
regulatory changes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Long-Lived Assets:

Goodwill
is evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis and
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be
impaired.

Long-lived
assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is determined by the Company at the level for which there are
identifiable cash flows by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future
undiscounted net cash flows before interest expense and income taxes expected to be
generated by the assets. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets (based on market prices
in an active market or on discounted cash flows). Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.

The
Company completed an annual impairment analysis of its indefinite lived assets, including
goodwill, and has found no instances of impairment as of December 31, 2004.

Intangible Assets:

Prior
to July 1, 2001, the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets
acquired was recorded as goodwill and amortized on the straight-line basis ranging from 20
to 40 years. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets”. This standard requires that goodwill and other
intangibles that are acquired in business combinations and that have indefinite useful
lives are not to be amortized and are to be reviewed for impairment annually based on an
assessment of fair value. Other intangibles (patents and technology, customer lists and
non-compete agreements), are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods
to be benefited, such as legal life for patents and technology, 10 to 25 years for
customer lists and contractual lives for non-compete agreements. With the adoption of SFAS
No. 142, the Company reassessed the useful lives of these intangible assets and determined
that no changes were necessary.

Research and Development:

In
August 2003, the Company formed a new, majority-owned subsidiary with a former owner of
the Company’s subsidiary, National Genetics Institute, Inc. In conjunction with the
formation of this subsidiary, the principals entered into a two-year joint venture
agreement whereby the Company will fund a total of $3.0 for research and development
efforts to be conducted on behalf of the newly formed subsidiary. It is the Company’s
policy to expense all research and development costs when incurred. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had incurred approximately $1.4 in costs associated with this venture.

Reclassifications:

Certain
amounts in the prior year’s financial statements have been reclassified to conform
with the current year presentation. In connection with the preparation of these financial
statements, we concluded that it was appropriate to classify certain securities with
original maturities exceeding three months as short- term investments. Previously, such
investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, we have revised
the classification to report these securities as short-term investments in a separate line
item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003. We have also made
corresponding adjustments to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended
December 31, 2003, to reflect the gross purchases of these securities as investing
activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents. This change in
classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from
financing activities in our previously reported Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or
our previously reported Consolidated Statements of Income for any period.

2.    
          BUSINESS ACQUISITION – DIANON SYSTEMS, INC.

On
January 17, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares
of DIANON Systems, Inc. (DIANON) for $47.50 per share in cash, or approximately $596.0
including transaction fees and expenses, and converted approximately 390,000 vested DIANON
employee stock options into approximately 690,000 vested Company options valued at $8.5.
The transaction total of approximately $604.5 was funded by a combination of cash on hand,
borrowings under the Company’s senior credit facilities and a bridge loan facility.

DIANON
is a leading provider of anatomic pathology and oncology testing services in the U.S. and
had 2001 revenues of approximately $125.7. DIANON had approximately 1,100 employees at the
closing date of the acquisition and processed more than 8,000 samples per day in one main
testing facility and four regional labs.

The
acquisition of DIANON was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. As such,
the cost to acquire DIANON has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based
on estimated fair values as of the closing date. The consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations of DIANON subsequent to the closing of the acquisition.

The
following table summarizes the Company’s purchase price allocation related to the
acquisition of DIANON based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed on the acquisition date.

As
a result of this acquisition, the Company recorded an addition to non-deductible goodwill
of approximately $355.5, an addition to customer lists of approximately $227.8 (expected
period of benefit of 30 years, non-deductible for tax) and an addition to trade names of
approximately $43.7 (expected period of benefit of 15 years, non-deductible for tax).

The
Company believes that it is now in a position nationally to offer to both primary care
physicians and specialists such as oncologists, urologists and gastroenterologists, the
broadest range of leading-edge anatomic, genomic and clinical testing technology for the
large and rapidly growing cancer diagnostic market.

3. BUSINESS ACQUISITION
– DYNACARE INC.

On
July 25, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of
Dynacare Inc. in a combination cash and stock transaction with a combined value of
approximately $496.4 including transaction costs. The Company also converted approximately
553,958 unvested Dynacare stock options into 297,013 unvested Company options to acquire
shares of the Company at terms comparable to those under the predecessor Dynacare plan.
This conversion of outstanding unvested options increased the non-cash consideration of
the transaction by approximately $5.0 and resulted in the recording of initial deferred

(F-16)

OF AMERICA HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

compensation of approximately $2.5.
In conjunction with this acquisition, the Company repaid Dynacare’s existing $204.4
of senior subordinated unsecured notes, including a call premium of approximately $7.0.
The transaction was financed by issuing approximately 4.9 million shares of the
Company’s common stock, valued at approximately $245.6, assuming unvested Dynacare
options valued at $5.0, and using $245.8 in available cash and the proceeds of a $150.0
bridge loan and borrowings of $50.0 under the Company’s $300.0 senior credit
facilities.

The
Company terminated a number of interest rate swap agreements related to Dynacare’s
existing senior subordinated unsecured notes. The $19.6 the Company received upon
termination of these swap agreements was included in the estimated fair value of the net
assets acquired as of July 25, 2002.

Dynacare
had 2001 revenues of approximately $238.0 and had approximately 6,300 employees at the
closing date of the acquisition. Dynacare operated in 21 states and two provinces in
Canada with 24 primary laboratories, 2 esoteric laboratories, 115 rapid response labs and
302 patient service centers.

The
acquisition of Dynacare was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. As
such, the cost to acquire Dynacare has been allocated to the assets and liabilities
acquired based on fair values as of the closing date. The consolidated financial
statements include the results of operations of Dynacare subsequent to the closing of the
acquisition.

The
following table summarizes the Company’s purchase price allocation related to the
acquisition of Dynacare based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed on the acquisition date.

As
a result of this acquisition, the Company recorded an addition to non-deductible goodwill
of approximately $173.3 and an addition to customer lists of approximately $52.5 (expected
period of benefit of 15 years). The investments in equity affiliates include $341.7 of
Canadian licenses (with an indefinite life and deductible for tax).

The
Company believes that the acquisition of Dynacare enhances its ability to provide health
coverage in the United States and Canada by expanding its customer base and service
capabilities. The Company believes that the price paid for the outstanding shares of
Dynacare was competitive with market conditions existing at the time.

5. INTEGRATION OF
DYNACARE AND DIANON

During
the third quarter of 2002, the Company finalized its plan related to the integration of
Dynacare’s U.S. operations into the Company’s service delivery network. The plan
focuses on reducing redundant facilities, while maintaining a focus on providing excellent
customer service. A reduction in staffing will occur as the Company executes the
integration plan and consolidates duplicate or overlapping functions and

facilities.    
          Employee groups being affected as a result of this plan include those involved
          in the collection and testing of specimens, as well as administrative and other
          support functions.

In
connection with the Dynacare integration plan, the Company recorded $14.6 of costs
associated with the execution of the plan. The majority of these integration costs related
to employee severance and contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and
equipment. Of the total costs indicated above, $12.1 related to actions that impact the
employees and operations of Dynacare, and was accounted for as a cost of the Dynacare
acquisition and included in goodwill. Of the $12.1, $6.0 related to employee severance
benefits for approximately 722 employees, with the remainder primarily related to
contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment. In addition, the
Company recorded restructuring expense of $2.5, relating to integration costs of actions
that impact the Company’s existing employees and operations. Of this amount $1.0
related to employee severance benefits for approximately 78 employees, with the remainder
primarily related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and
equipment.

The
Company also recorded a special bad debt provision of approximately $15.0 related to the
acquired Dynacare accounts receivable balance. This provision, based on Company
experience, was made in anticipation of changes in staffing and collection procedures that
will occur as the Company converts Dynacare customers to LabCorp’s billing system and
related customer service organization.

In
connection with the DIANON integration plan, the Company recorded $20.8 of costs
associated with the execution of the plan. The majority of these integration costs related
to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment ($12.7) and
employee severance ($8.1). These costs were accounted for as costs of the DIANON
acquisition.

During
the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge
totaling $6.4 in connection with the continuing integration of its recent acquisitions.
Substantially all of this charge relates to the fair value of employee severance benefits
for approximately 730 employees. The Company also recorded certain adjustments in the
fourth quarter of 2003 to previously recorded restructuring charges due to changes in
estimates, resulting in a net credit of approximately $4.9.

placement. The Company received

(F-21)

LABORATORY CORPORATION
OF AMERICA HOLDINGS AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except
per share data)

approximately $426.8 (net of
underwriter’s fees of approximately $9.8) in net proceeds from the offering. In
October 2001, the underwriters exercised their rights to purchase an additional $94.0
aggregate principal amount pursuant to an overallotment option from which the Company
received approximately $61.8 in net proceeds (net of underwriters fees of approximately
$1.4). The notes, which are subordinate to the Company’s bank debt, were sold at an
issue price of $671.65 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity (representing a yield to
maturity of 2.0% per year). Each one thousand dollar principal amount at maturity of the
notes is convertible into 13.4108 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances, if one of the following conditions occurs:

1)

If the sales price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading
          days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day
          of the preceding quarter reaches specified thresholds (beginning at 120% and
          declining 0.1282% per quarter until it reaches approximately 110% for the
          quarter beginning July 1, 2021 of the accreted conversion price per share of
          common stock on the last day of the preceding quarter). The accreted conversion
          price per share will equal the issue price of a note plus the accrued original
          issue discount and any accrued contingent additional principal, divided by the
          number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a note on that day.
          The conversion trigger price for the fourth quarter of 2004 was approximately
          $63.12.

2)

If the credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
          Services is at or below BB-.

3)

If the notes are called for redemption.

4)

If
          specified corporate transactions have occurred (such as if the Company is party
          to a consolidation,

merger
or binding share exchange or a transfer of all or substantially all of its assets).

of the notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes
on September 11, 2006 and 2011 at prices ranging from $741.92 to $819.54, plus any accrued
contingent additional principal and any accrued contingent interest thereon.

The
Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after
September 11, 2006 at specified redemption prices per one thousand dollar principal amount
at maturity of the notes ranging from $741.92 at September 11, 2006 to $1,000.00 at
September 11, 2021 (assuming no contingent additional principal accrues on the notes).

The
Company used a portion of the proceeds to repay $412.5 of its term loan outstanding under
its credit agreement and to pay $8.9 to terminate the interest rate swap agreement tied to
the Company’s term loan. The Company recorded a loss of $5.5 relating to the
write-off of unamortized bank fees associated with the Company’s term debt.

The
Company has registered the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of the notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

13. LONG-TERM DEBT

On
January 13, 2005, the Company entered into a $350.0 senior credit facility with Credit
Suisse First Boston and UBS Securities LLC, acting as Co-Lead Arrangers, and a group of
financial institutions. This new five year credit facility replaced the existing $150.0
364-day revolving credit facility and the $200.0 three-year revolving credit facility
which was amended on January 14, 2003 and was scheduled to expire on February 18, 2005.
The new facility also provides for an accordion feature to increase the facility up to an
additional $150 million, with the consent of the lenders, if needed to support the
Company’s growth. Based upon the Company’s rating as of December 31, 2004, the
effective rate under the $200.0 and $150.0 facilities was LIBOR plus 82.5 basis points and
LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points, respectively. There were no balances outstanding on the
Company’s senior credit facilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The
senior credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working
capital, capital expenditures, funding of share repurchases and other payments, and
acquisitions. This credit facility bears interest at varying rates based upon the
Company’s credit rating with Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.

On
October 22, 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
program under which the Company may purchase up to an aggregate of $150.0 of its common
stock from time-to-time. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company completed this
program purchasing approximately 5.2 million shares of its common stock totaling
approximately $150.0 with cash flow from operations.

On
December 17, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
program under which the Company may purchase up to an aggregate of $250.0 of its common
stock from time-to-time, beginning in the first quarter of 2004. During the first nine
months of 2004, the Company completed this program, purchasing approximately 6.2 million
shares of its common stock totaling $250.0 with cash flow from operations.

On

15. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS
PLAN

The
Company adopted a stockholder rights plan effective as of December 13, 2001 that provides
that each common stockholder of record on December 21, 2001 received a dividend of one
right for each share of common stock held. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from
the Company one-hundredth of a share of a new series of participating preferred stock at
an initial purchase price of four hundred dollars. These rights will become exercisable
and will detach from the Company’s common stock if any person becomes the beneficial
owner of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock. In that event, each right will
entitle the holder, other than the acquiring person, to purchase, for the initial purchase
price, shares of the Company’s common stock having a value of twice the initial
purchase price. The rights will expire on December 13, 2011, unless earlier exchanged or
redeemed.

16. INTEREST RATE SWAP
AGREEMENTS

In
the second quarter of 2003 the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreement with a
major financial institution and received net proceeds of $5.3 of which $1.4 was credited
to interest expense and a gain of $3.9 was deferred and is being amortized to interest
expense through 2013.

18. STOCK COMPENSATION
PLANS

In
May 2000, the shareholders approved the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, authorizing 6.8 million
shares for issuance under the plan plus the remaining shares available from the Amended
and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1994 Stock Option Plan (the “Prior
Plans”). The effect was to increase to 11.68 million, the number of shares available
under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and Prior Plans.

In
May 2002, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan
authorizing an additional 8.0 million shares. The effect was to increase to an aggregate
of 19.68 million shares for issuance under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

During
2004, there were 1,757,260 options granted to officers, key employees, and non-employee
directors of the Company. The exercise price for these options ranged from $38.80 to
$40.50 per share.

During
March 2004, the Company recorded aggregate awards of 11,329 shares of restricted stock at
a weighted average price of $35.29 to one of the principals in the Company’s research
and development joint venture and a non-employee director under its 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan.

The
plan provides for accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted shares in percentages of
33.3%, 66.7% or 100%, if certain predefined two-year profitability targets are achieved as
of December 31, 2003 or certain three-year profitability targets are achieved as of
December 31, 2004. The unearned restricted stock compensation is being amortized to
expense over the applicable vesting periods. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, total restricted
stock compensation expense was $15.6, $18.1 and $14.3, respectively. At December 31, 2004,
there were 5,304,751 additional shares available for grant under the Company’s stock
option plans.

The
following table summarizes grants of non-qualified options made by the Company to
officers, key employees, and non-employee directors under all plans. Stock options are
generally granted at an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market price per
share on the date of grant. Also, for each grant, options vest ratably over a period of
two to three years on the anniversaries of the grant date, subject to their earlier
expiration or termination.

Changes in options outstanding under the plans for the periods indicated were as follows:

On
January 17, 2003, the Company converted approximately 378,422 vested Dianon stock options
into 669,614 vested Company options to acquire shares of the Company at terms comparable
to those under the predecessor Dianon plan. The Company is not expecting to make further
grants from this plan. Options issued above or below market value during 2003 and 2002
were issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of DIANON and Dynacare.

20. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

On
June 24, 2003, the Company and certain of its executive officers were sued in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in the first of a series
of putative shareholder class actions alleging securities fraud. Since that date, at least
five other complaints containing substantially identical allegations have been filed
against the Company and certain of the Company’s executive officers. Each of the
complaints alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making
material misstatements and/or omissions that caused the price of the Company’s stock
to be artificially inflated between February 13 and October 3, 2002. The plaintiffs seek
certification of a class of substantially all persons who purchased shares of the
Company’s stock during that time period and unspecified monetary damages. These six
cases have been consolidated and will proceed as a single case. The defendants deny any
liability and intend to defend the case vigorously. The plaintiffs have recently filed a
consolidated amended complaint. On July 16, 2004, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss
the consolidated complaint and continue to defend the case vigorously. At this time, it is
premature to make any assessment of the potential outcome of the cases or whether they
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

The
Company is the appellant in a patent case originally filed by Competitive Technologies,
Inc. and Metabolite Laboratories, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment against the
Company for patent infringement, with total damages and attorney’s fees payable by
the Company of approximately $7.8 million. The Company vigorously contested the judgment
and appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On
June 8, 2004, that court affirmed the judgment against the Company and, on August 5, 2004,
the Company’s request for rehearing was denied. On November 3, 2004, the Company
filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. The
underlying judgment has been paid and, on January 25, 2005, the United States Court of
Appeal for the Federal Circuit confirmed the attorneys’ fees portion of the judgment.
The Company has filed a request to stay the award of attorneys’ fees pending the
resolution of the Company’s appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The Company
plans to continue to vigorously contest the Judgment until it exhausts all reasonable
appellate rights.

The
Company is also involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. These matters include, but are not limited to, intellectual property
disputes, professional liability, employee related matters, and inquiries from
governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid payers and managed care payers requesting
comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention
through billing audits or third parties. In the opinion of management, based upon the
advice of counsel and consideration of all facts available at this time, the ultimate
disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. The Company is also
named from time to time in suits brought under the

qui tam

provisions of the False
Claims Act. These suits typically allege that the Company has made false statements and/or
certifications in connection with claims for payment from federal health care programs.
They may remain under seal (hence, unknown to the Company) for some time while the
government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the

qui tam

plaintiff. Such
claims are an inevitable part of doing business in the health care field today and, in the
opinion of management, based upon the advice of counsel and consideration of all facts
available at this time, the ultimate disposition of those

qui tam

matters presently
known to the Company is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all statutes,
regulations and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The
clinical laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and the
courts have not interpreted many of these statutes and regulations. There can be no
assurance therefore that those applicable statutes and regulations might not be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner
that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these
statutes and regulations include significant fines and the loss of various licenses,
certificates and authorizations.

Under
the Company’s present insurance programs, coverage is obtained for catastrophic
exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company is
responsible for the uninsured portion of losses related primarily to general, professional
and vehicle liability, certain medical costs and workers’ compensation. The
self-insured retentions are on a per occurrence basis without any aggregate annual limit.
Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon the
Company’s estimates of the aggregated liability of claims incurred. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the Company had provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $63.5
and $57.1 respectively, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs.

21. PENSION AND
POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

The
Company maintains a defined contribution pension plan for all eligible employees. Eligible
employees are defined as individuals who are age 21 or older, have been employed by the
Company for at least six consecutive months and have completed 1,000 hours of service.
Company contributions to the plan are based on a percentage of employee contributions. The
cost of this plan was $11.0, $10.9 and $8.5 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In
addition, substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a defined benefit
retirement plan (the “Company Plan”). The benefits to be paid under the Company
Plan are based on years of credited service and average final compensation. The
Company’s policy is to fund the Company Plan with at least the minimum amount
required by applicable regulations.

The
Company has a second defined benefit plan which covers its senior management group that
provides for the payment of the difference, if any, between the amount of any maximum
limitation on annual benefit payments under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 and the annual benefit that would be payable under the Company Plan but for such
limitation. This plan is an unfunded plan.

health care cost trend rate-medical was assumed to be 10.0% and 9.0% as of December 31,

12.0% as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, declining gradually to 5.0% in the
year 2012. The health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts
reported. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by a percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December
31, 2004 by $7.0. The impact of a percentage point change on the aggregate of the service
cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost results
in an increase of $0.7 or decrease of $0.6.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

(Dollars in millions, except

Therefore,
the following changes in accounting for this plan have been recognized because of the
legislation and in accordance with FASB Staff Position 106-2. Laboratory Corporation of
America Holdings has worked with its actuary to analyze the accounting impact of the
federal subsidy.

1)

The Company adopted FSP 106-2 retroactively and as such the Accumulated
                    Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) determined as of January 1, 2004 has
                    been reduced by $6.9. This reduction has been recorded as an actuarial gain in
                    accordance with FSP 106-2.

2)

The effect of this gain is to reduce the amortization of unrecognized actuarial
                    loss by $0.3.

3)

The Service Cost component of SFAS106 expense for fiscal 2004
                    has been reduced by $0.1.

4)

The Interest Cost component of SFAS106 expense for
                    fiscal 2004 has been reduced by $0.2.

5)

In total, for fiscal 2004, the
                    Company’s SFAS106 net periodic postretirement benefit expense has been reduced
accordingly by $0.6.

Laboratory
Corporation of America Holdings will continue to review all interpretive guidance and
regulations issued by HHS and may modify its plans once further guidance is available.

23. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On
February 3, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Pathology Labs
(“US LABS”) for approximately $155 in cash. US LABS, based in Irvine,
California, is a national, anatomic pathology reference laboratory devoted to
comprehensive, high-quality, rapid-response cancer testing. The company provides

December 2004 the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued FAS 123(R),

Share-Based Payment (revised 2004)

. This Statement is a revision of FASB Statement
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based

Compensation. This Statement supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and its related
implementation guidance. This Statement establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It
also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or
services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This Statement focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance
for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in
Statement 123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity
Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services.” This Statement does not address the accounting for
employee share ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA Statement of Position 93-6,

Employers’ Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans.

The Company has not
finalized what, if any, changes may be made to its equity compensation plans in light of
the accounting change, and therefore is not yet in a position to quantify its impact. The
Company expects to announce the impact in connection with reporting its second quarter
2005 financial results. The impact on cash from operations of adopting the new accounting
standard cannot be estimated at this time. See “Note 1 to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for proforma impact of expensing all equity-based compensation, which the
Company believes would approximate the annual effect of adopting the new accounting
standard.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

. This
Statement amends the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.

That statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in
that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement
amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception to for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. The Company has not historically entered into a significant level
of nonmonetary transactions and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact
is financial position or results unless nonmonetary transactions are utilized in the
future.
