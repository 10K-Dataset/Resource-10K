PART I

Item
1.

Business

Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.
(“Maxim” or the “Company”) designs,
develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of linear and
mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog
circuits. The Company also provides a range of high-frequency
design processes and capabilities that can be used in custom
design. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by
many diverse applications, a great number of product variations,
and, as to many circuit types, relatively long product life
cycles. Maxim’s objective is to develop and market both
proprietary and industry-standard analog integrated circuits
that meet the increasingly stringent quality standards demanded
by customers. Based on product announcements by its competitors,
Maxim believes that in the past 19 years it has developed
more products for the analog market, including proprietary and
second-source products, than any of its competitors over the
same period.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the
Company acquired Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. The Company
issued approximately 41.0 million shares of its common
stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Dallas
Semiconductor. In addition, the Company assumed all stock
options to purchase Dallas Semiconductor common stock in
exchange for options to purchase approximately 5.9 million
shares of the Company’s common stock. The transaction was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, unless
specifically stated otherwise, all financial data of the Company
was restated to include the historical financial data of Dallas
Semiconductor. See Note 3 “Business Combination”
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at
pages 39 and 40. At the time of the acquisition, Dallas
Semiconductor’s product line consisted of 390 proprietary
base products sold to over 15,000 customers worldwide.
Applications for those products include battery management,
broadband telecommunications, wireless handsets, cellular base
stations, networking, servers, data storage, and a wide variety
of industrial equipment.

The Company is a Delaware corporation that was
originally incorporated in California in 1983. It is
headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The mailing address for
the Company’s headquarters is 120 San Gabriel Drive,
Sunnyvale, California 94086, and the Company’s telephone
number is (408) 737-7600. Additional information about the
Company is available on the Company’s website at
www.maxim-ic.com.

The Analog Integrated Circuit Market

All electronic signals fall into one of two
categories, linear or digital. Linear (or analog) signals
represent real world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure,
sound, or speed, and are continuously variable over a wide range
of values. Digital signals represent the “ones” and
“zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off.

Three general classes of semiconductor products
arise from this partitioning of signals into linear or digital.
There are those, such as memories and microprocessors, that
operate only in the digital domain. There are linear devices
such as amplifiers, references, analog multiplexers, and
switches that operate primarily in the analog domain. Finally,
there are mixed-signal devices that combine linear and digital
functions on the same integrated circuit and interface between
the analog and digital worlds. Maxim’s strategy has been to
target both the linear and mixed-signal markets, often
collectively referred to as the analog market. In addition,
Maxim has added some Dallas Semiconductor products that are
exclusively or principally digital as well as a significant
number of engineers skilled in digital design and software
development. Although the acquisition has not substantially
affected Maxim’s strong focus on the linear and mixed
signal market, it has supplemented Maxim’s capabilities in
the digital area in ways that should enable development of new
products, mixed signal and other, with very sophisticated
digital characteristics. Risks associated with fulfilling this
expectation are discussed in “Item 1.,
Business — Trends, Risks and Uncertainties” at
pages 8 through 13.

The Company believes that, compared to the
digital integrated circuit market, the analog market has
generally been characterized by a wider range of standard
products used in smaller quantities by a larger number of
customers, and in many cases, by longer product life cycles and
lower capital requirements as a result of generally using less
dense manufacturing technologies. The Company believes that the
widespread



application of low-cost microprocessor-based
systems and of digital communication technologies has affected
the market for analog integrated circuits by increasing the need
for signal conditioning interfaces between the digital and
analog world.

The analog market is a fragmented group of
markets, serving numerous and widely differing applications for
instrumentation, industrial control, data processing,
communications, military, video, and selected medical equipment.
For each application, different users may have unique
requirements for circuits with specific resolution, accuracy,
linearity, speed, power, and signal amplitude capability, which
results in a high degree of market complexity. Maxim’s
products can be used in a variety of applications, but serve
only certain portions of the total analog market.

Products and Applications

The Company believes that it addresses the
requirements of the market by providing competitively priced
products that add value to electronic equipment with superior
quality and reliability.

The Company’s research and development
programs emphasize development of technically innovative
processes and products. In addition, the Company also develops
second source products. The Company’s products are
available with numerous packaging alternatives, including
packages for surface mount technology.

The following table illustrates the major
industries served by the Company and typical applications for
which the Company’s products can be used:



The Company also sells products for military,
video, and selected medical equipment.

While Maxim’s proprietary products have
received substantial market acceptance, some of Maxim’s
competitors have developed second source products for some of
Maxim’s successful innovative proprietary products.
Typically in the semiconductor industry, when a proprietary
product becomes second sourced, the credibility of the original
design is enhanced, and there is an opportunity to increase
total revenues as the potential customers’ reluctance to
design in a sole-source product is removed, but gross margins
may be adversely affected due to increased price competition.

Product Quality

Maxim places strong emphasis on product quality
from initial design through final quality assurance for the end
product. In the product design phase, Maxim applies a set of
circuit design rules that it believes result in enhanced product
reliability. Upon receipt from Maxim’s own fabrication
facilities or from silicon foundries, a majority of processed
wafers are tested for conformance with specific parameters.
Products are individually tested using specialized test
equipment and complex programs to ensure that they meet data
sheet performance levels. In addition, long-term operating life
and mechanical stress tests are routinely performed on samples
to assure continued, long-term product performance. Dallas
Semiconductor has adopted Maxim’s



quality assurance methodologies. Maxim is still
in the process of making the design, fabrication, and test
operations of Dallas Semiconductor consistent with Maxim’s
methodologies.

Semiconductor fabrication is a complex process.
Although Maxim believes that the above testing regime is
comprehensive and that it meets or exceeds industry standards, a
possibility exists that failure mechanisms could elude
detection. This could expose the company to liability,
unforeseen customer returns, and loss of reputation.

Manufacturing

Maxim uses its own wafer fabrication and, to a
small extent, silicon foundries to produce wafers. The majority
of processed wafers are subjected to parametric and functional
testing at the Company’s facilities. As is customary in the
industry, the Company ships most of its processed wafers to
foreign assembly subcontractors, located in the Philippines,
Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, where wafers are separated
into individual integrated circuits and assembled into a variety
of packages.

After assembly has been completed, the majority
of the assembled product is shipped to the Company’s test
facilities located in Cavite, the Philippines, and Samutprakarn
Province, Thailand. The Company performs about half of its wafer
sort operations at its U.S. facilities and about half of its
wafer sort operations at its facility located in Cavite, the
Philippines, with the capacity to electronically test and laser
trim the majority of the Company’s wafers. During fiscal
year 2002, the Company transferred the testing operations for
Dallas product to the Company’s test facilities located in
Cavite, the Philippines, with the exception of low volume Dallas
product, which will continue to be tested in Dallas, Texas. At
the end of fiscal year 2002, approximately 75% of the testing of
Dallas product was performed at the Company’s test
facilities located in Cavite, the Philippines.

In fiscal year 2002, the Company expanded
manufacturing space at its second test facility located in
Samutprakarn Province, Thailand. It is expected that this
facility, as well as the facility in Cavite, the Philippines,
will continue to expand test capacity as demand dictates.
Currently, the Company’s facilities located in Cavite, the
Philippines and Samutprakarn Province, Thailand combined have
enough test manufacturing and shipping space to meet the
Company’s fiscal year 2003 financial plan, subject always
to normal and to unforeseen challenges in meeting product demand.

Once testing has been completed, finished product
from the Company’s test facility located in Samutprakarn
Province, Thailand is shipped to the Company’s finished
goods location at its test facility in Cavite, the Philippines.
Finished product is either shipped directly from Cavite, the
Philippines to customers worldwide or to other Company locations
for sale to end customers or distributors.

The broad range of products demanded by the
analog integrated circuit market requires multiple manufacturing
process technologies. Many different process technologies are
currently used for wafer fabrication of the Company’s
products. Historically, wafer fabrication of analog integrated
circuits has not required the state-of-the-art processing
equipment necessary for the fabrication of advanced digital
integrated circuits, although newer processes do utilize and
require some of these facilities and equipment. In addition,
hybrid products are manufactured using a complex multichip
technology featuring thin-film, thick-film, and laser-trimmed
resistors.

For the majority of these technologies, the
Company relies on its fabrication facilities in San Jose,
California; Beaverton, Oregon; Dallas, Texas; and, to a small
extent, manufacturing subcontractors. The Company currently uses
five subcontract silicon foundries that represent less than 5%
of wafer production. None of the subcontractors currently used
by Maxim is affiliated with Maxim.

Most of the wafers produced in fiscal year 2002
were manufactured at one of the Company’s three wafer
fabrication facilities. The Company’s wafer fabrication
facility located in Dallas, Texas was originally built in 1986
and expanded in 1989, 1994 and 2001. This facility currently
produces six-inch wafers. The Company is in the process of
replacing six-inch production capacity at this facility with
eight-inch wafer production. Once the production of eight-inch
wafers has been fully implemented, it is the Company’s
intention to discontinue production of six-inch wafers at this
facility. See Note 13 “Merger and Special Charges” of
the Notes to



Consolidated Financial Statements at
pages 49 to 51. In December 1989, the Company acquired
a four-inch wafer fabrication facility in Sunnyvale, California
capable of producing 3 micron CMOS and bipolar products. In
May 1994, the Company acquired a mixed-class wafer fabrication
facility in Beaverton, Oregon capable of producing CMOS and
bipolar products. In November 1997, the Company acquired a
sub-micron wafer fabrication facility in San Jose,
California. The Company transferred production from the 4-inch
wafer fabrication facility in Sunnyvale to the Beaverton
facility and suspended wafer production at the Sunnyvale
facility in December 1998. The Beaverton, Oregon and
San Jose, California wafer fabrication facilities currently
manufacture 6-inch wafers. The Company is in the process of
expanding production capacity at its San Jose, California
facility to include 8-inch wafer production. Once this has been
completed, the Company intends to discontinue 6-inch wafer
production at this facility. See “Item 2.,
Properties” at page 14.

In the past and as sometimes happens in the
semiconductor industry, the Company has experienced disruptions
in the supply of processed wafers due to quality problems or
failure to achieve satisfactory electrical yields. If the
foundries used by the Company were unwilling or the
Company’s own internal wafer fabrication facilities were
unable to produce adequate supplies of processed wafers
conforming to the Company’s quality standards, the
Company’s business and relationships with its customers
could be adversely affected.

Due to the relatively lengthy manufacturing
cycle, the Company builds some of its inventory in advance of
receiving orders from its customers. As a consequence of
inaccuracies inherent in forecasting, inventory imbalances
periodically occur that result in surplus amounts of some
Company products and shortages of others. Such shortages can
adversely affect customer relations and surpluses can result in
larger-than-desired inventory levels, which can adversely affect
the Company’s financial position. Excess inventory issues
can also arise when customers cancel orders. Finished products
and work in process for those orders may be unsaleable. See
“Item 1., Business — Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties — Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results” at page 8.

Sales and Marketing

In the United States and Canada, the Company
sells its products through a direct sales and applications
organization in nine regional sales offices and through its own
and other unaffiliated distribution channels. As is customary in
the industry, most domestic distributors are entitled to certain
price rebates and product return privileges.

International sales are conducted by
25 Maxim sales offices, 2 sales representative
organizations and 30 distributors. In fiscal year 2002, the
Company completed the reorganization and consolidation of the
worldwide distribution channel. The Company sells in both United
States dollars and various foreign currencies. A majority of the
Company’s international sales are billed and payable in
United States dollars and are therefore not directly subject to
currency exchange fluctuations. A portion of the Company’s
sales from its United Kingdom, French, and German affiliates is
denominated in the local currencies. The majority of the sales
to customers and distributors located in Japan are denominated
in yen. The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts to protect the United States dollar value of its firm
sales commitments and net monetary assets. Changes in the
relative value of the dollar, however, may create pricing
pressures for Maxim’s products. In addition, various forms
of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in the
United States and certain foreign countries. A change in current
tariff structures or other trade policies could adversely affect
the Company’s foreign marketing strategies. In general,
payment terms for foreign customers, distributors and others,
which represent a majority of the Company’s accounts
receivable at June 29, 2002, are longer than for U.S.
customers. Certain major Japanese customers have payment terms
that are generally well beyond payment terms extended to
customers in other geographic locations. As is customary in the
semiconductor industry, the Company’s domestic distributors
may market products competitive with Maxim’s.

International sales accounted for approximately
66%, 57%, and 53% of net revenues in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. See Note 12 “Segment
Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at pages 48 and 49.



As of June 29, 2002, the Company’s
backlog was approximately $239 million as compared to
approximately $234 million at June 30, 2001. The
Company includes in its backlog customer-released orders with
firm schedules for shipment within the next 12 months. As
is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be
canceled in most cases without penalty to the customers. In
addition, the Company’s backlog includes orders from
domestic distributors as to which revenues are not recognized
until the products are sold by the distributors. Accordingly,
the Company believes that its backlog at any time should not be
used as a measure of future revenues. All of the backlog numbers
have been adjusted to be net of cancellations and estimated
future U.S. distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.

The Company warrants its products to its
customers generally for 12 months from shipment, but in
certain cases for longer periods. Warranty expense to date has
been minimal. In certain other cases, the Company warrants
products to include liability beyond the cost of replacing the
product.

Research and Development

The Company believes that research and
development is critical to its future success. Objectives for
the research and development function include definition,
design, and layout of innovative proprietary products that meet
customer needs, development of second-source products, design of
parts for high yield and reliability, test development, and
development of manufacturing processes and advanced packaging to
support an expanding product line.

Due to the research and development plans of the
Company and the shortage of qualified design engineering talent,
the Company does not always have the number of engineers
required to meet its research and development goals.

Research and development expenses were
approximately $275.5 million, $280.2 million, and
$216.8 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000
respectively.

Competition

The analog integrated circuit industry is
intensely competitive, and virtually all major semiconductor
companies presently compete with, or conceivably could compete
with, some segment of the Company’s business. Maxim’s
competitors are Altera Corporation, Anadigics Inc., Analog
Devices, Inc., Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, Conexant
Systems Inc., Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc.,
Exar Corp., Infineon Technologies AG, Intel
Corporation’s Level One Communications, Inc. Subsidiary,
Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation, Lucent
Technologies, Micrel Inc., Microchip Technology Inc.,
Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co. Ltd.,
Motorola Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation, ON
Semiconductor Corporation, Philips Electronics N.V.,
PMC-Sierra Inc., RF Micro Devices Inc., Ricoh
Company Ltd., Seiko Corporation, Semtech Corporation,
STMicroelectronics N.V., Silicon Laboratories Inc.,
Siliconix Inc., Sipex Corporation, Texas
Instruments Inc., Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation and
others, including start-up companies. Some of Maxim’s
competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing,
and marketing resources than the Company, and some of
Maxim’s competitors have greater technical resources. The
Company believes it competes favorably with these corporations
primarily on the basis of technical innovation, product
definition, quality, price, and service. There can be no
assurance that competitive factors will not adversely affect the
Company’s future business.

Patents, Licenses, and Other Intellectual
Property Rights

The Company relies primarily upon know-how,
rather than on patents, to develop and maintain its competitive
position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop
or patent similar technology or reverse engineer the
Company’s products or that the confidentiality agreements
with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other
suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect the
Company’s interests.

The Company currently owns 412 U.S. patents and
60 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from 2002
to 2020. In addition, the Company has applied for 120 U.S.
patents, a large number of which have corresponding patent
applications in multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is the
Company’s policy to seek patent



protection for significant inventions that may be
patented, though the Company may elect, in appropriate cases,
not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if
other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade
secret, is considered more advantageous. In addition, the
Company has registered certain of its mask sets under the
Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.

There can be no assurance that any patent will
issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will
provide substantive protection for the technology or product
covered by it. The Company believes that patent and mask work
protection is of less significance in its business than
experience, innovation, and management skill.

Maxim has registered several of its trademarks
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign
jurisdictions.

Maxim is a party to a number of licenses,
including patent licenses and other licenses obtained from
Tektronix in connection with its acquisition of Tektronix’s
ICO in May 1994.

Due to the many technological developments and
the technical complexity of the semiconductor industry, it is
possible that certain of the Company’s designs or processes
may involve infringement of patents or other intellectual
property rights held by others. From time to time, the Company
has received, and in the future may receive, notice of claims of
infringement by its products on intellectual property rights of
third parties. (See “Item 1., Business —
Trends, Risks and Uncertainties — Intellectual
Property Litigation and Claims” at page 12, and
“Item 3., Legal Proceedings” at page 15.) If
any such infringements were to exist, the Company might be
obligated to seek a license from the holder of the rights and
might have liability for past infringement. In the past, it has
been common semiconductor industry practice for patent holders
to offer licenses on reasonable terms and rates. Although in
some situations, typically where the patent directly relates to
a specific product or family of products, patent holders have
refused to grant licenses, though the practice of offering
licenses appears to be generally continuing. However, no
assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain
licenses as needed in all cases or that the terms of any license
that may be offered will be acceptable to Maxim. In those
circumstances where an acceptable license is not available, the
Company would need either to change the process or product so
that it no longer infringes or else stop manufacturing the
product or products involved in the infringement.

Environmental Regulation

Federal, state, and local regulations impose a
variety of environmental controls on the storage, handling,
discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in
semiconductor manufacturing. The Company’s facilities have
been designed to comply with these regulations, and it believes
that its activities are conducted in material compliance with
such regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that
interpretation and enforcement of current or future
environmental regulations will not impose costly requirements
upon the Company. Any failure of the Company to control
adequately the storage, use, and disposal of regulated
substances could result in future liabilities.

Increasing public attention has been focused on
the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations.
While the Company to date has not experienced any materially
adverse effects on its business from environmental regulations,
there can be no assurance that changes in such regulations will
not have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

Employees

The supply of skilled engineers required for
Maxim’s business is limited, and competition for such
personnel is intense. The Company’s growth also requires
the hiring or training of additional middle-level managers. If
the Company is unable to hire, retain, and motivate qualified
technical and management personnel, its operations and financial
results will be adversely affected.

None of the Company’s employees is subject
to a collective bargaining agreement.

As of June 29, 2002, the Company had 6,067
employees.



Trends, Risks and Uncertainties

An investment in the securities of Maxim involves
certain risks. In evaluating the Company and its business,
prospective investors should give careful consideration to the
factors listed below, in addition to the information provided
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the
documents incorporated herein by reference and in other
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Factors Affecting Future Operating
    Results

The Company’s future operating results are
difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors.

The semiconductor market has historically been
cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at
various times. After a period of increasing demand that extended
through fiscal year 2000, the semiconductor industry, including
the portions in which the Company participates, experienced
dramatically decreased demand. Although some of the causes of
that decrease are known, including significant excess
inventories in the hands of equipment manufacturers and other
potential customers, it remains unclear what all the causes may
have been and whether that period of decreased demand has ended.
In the last several quarters Maxim has achieved modest increases
in net revenues and profit. However, Maxim’s ability to
achieve future revenue growth depends on whether, and the extent
to which, demand for its products increases and reflects real
end user demand and whether customer cancellations and delays of
outstanding orders remain small.

Other key factors affecting the Company’s
revenues and operating results that could cause actual results
to differ materially from past or predicted results include the
timing of new product announcements or introductions by the
Company and its competitors, competitive pricing pressures,
fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing
efficiency, adequate availability of wafers and other materials
and manufacturing capacity, changes in product mix, and economic
conditions in the United States and international markets. As a
result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance
that the Company will not experience material fluctuations in
its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis.

The Company’s ability to realize its
quarterly revenue goals and projections is affected to a
significant extent by its ability to match inventory and current
production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders
on hand and orders received within a quarter for delivery in
that quarter (referred to as “turns business”). This
issue, which has been one of the distinguishing characteristics
of the analog integrated circuit industry, results from the very
large number of individual parts offered for sale and the very
large number of customers, combined with limitations on
Maxim’s and its customers’ ability to forecast orders
accurately, and relatively lengthy manufacturing cycles. Because
of this extreme complexity in the Company’s business, no
assurance can be given that the Company will achieve a match of
inventory on hand, production units, and shippable orders
sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue goals.

In addition, in certain markets where end-user
demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict,
such as notebook computers and cellular handsets, some Maxim
customers place orders that require Maxim to manufacture product
and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is
unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even
any, of the product. At any given time, this situation could
affect a portion of the Company’s backlog. As a result, in
any quarterly fiscal period, the Company is subject to the risk
of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp fall-off of sales
and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet
the customer’s unique requirements so that those cancelled
orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable
products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. Because
of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products
subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product
could be substantial. The Company routinely estimates inventory
reserves required for such product. Actual results may differ
from these reserve estimates, and such differences may be
material to Maxim’s financial condition, gross margins, and
results of operations.



Dependence on New Products and Process
    Technologies

The Company’s future success will continue
to depend on its continued ability to introduce new products and
to develop new process technologies. Semiconductor design and
process technology are subject to rapid technological change,
requiring a high level of expenditures for research and
development. Design and process development for the portions of
the semiconductor market in which the Company participates are
particularly challenging. The success of new product
introductions is dependent on several factors, including proper
new product selection, timely product introduction, achievement
of acceptable production yields, and market acceptance. From
time to time, Maxim has not fully achieved its new product
introduction and process development goals. There can be no
assurance that the Company will successfully develop or
implement new process technologies or that new products will be
introduced on a timely basis or receive substantial market
acceptance.

In addition, the Company’s growth is
dependent on its continued ability to penetrate new markets
where the Company has limited experience and competition is
intense. There can be no assurance that the markets being served
by the Company will grow (for example, older markets do saturate
and decline); that the Company’s existing and new products
will meet the requirements of such markets; that the
Company’s products will achieve customer acceptance in such
markets; that competitors will not force prices to an
unacceptably low level or take market share from the Company; or
that the Company can achieve or maintain profitability in these
markets.

Manufacturing Risks

The fabrication of integrated circuits is a
highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,
contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in
the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer
manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer
breakage, or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of
wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be
nonfunctional. The Company has from time to time experienced
lower-than-expected production yields and reliability problems,
which have delayed product shipments and adversely affected
gross margins. There can be no assurance that the Company will
not experience a decrease in manufacturing yields or reliability
problems, or that the Company will be able to maintain
acceptable manufacturing yields and reliability in the future.

The number of shippable dice per wafer for a
given product is critical to the Company’s results of
operations. To the extent the Company does not achieve
acceptable manufacturing yields or experiences delays in its
wafer fabrication, assembly or final test operations, its
results of operations could be adversely affected. During
periods of decreased demand, fixed wafer fabrication costs could
have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, gross margins, and results of operations.

The Company is currently in the process of
upgrading and expanding certain of its wafer manufacturing
capacity at its existing wafer manufacturing facilities in order
to convert to eight-inch wafers and develop new processes in
anticipation of increased customer demand for its products.
Should the Company be unsuccessful in completing this expansion
on time or should customer demand fail to increase and the
Company no longer needs the additional capacity, the
Company’s financial position and results of operations
could be adversely impacted.

The Company manufactures over 95% of its wafer
production requirements internally. Given the nature of the
Company’s products, it would be very difficult and costly
to arrange for independent manufacturing facilities to supply
such products. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of the
Company’s manufacturing facilities as a result of fire,
natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise,
would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition.

Competition

The Company experiences intense competition from
a number of companies, some of which have significantly greater
financial, manufacturing, and marketing resources than the
Company and some of which



have greater technical resources than the Company
and have intellectual property rights to which the Company is
not privy. To the extent that the Company’s proprietary
products become more successful, competitors will offer second
source products for some of those products, possibly causing
some erosion of profit margins. See “Item 1.,
Business — Competition” at page 6.

Dependence on Independent Distributors and
    Sales Representatives

A significant portion of the Company’s sales
is realized through independent electronics distributors and a
limited portion of the Company’s sales is realized through
independent sales representatives that are not under the control
of the Company. Dallas Semiconductor continues to have a larger
percentage of their sales through the distribution channel than
the Maxim only business. These independent sales organizations
generally represent product lines offered by several companies
and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to the
Company’s products or terminate their representation of the
Company. Payment terms for foreign distributors are
substantially longer, either according to contract or by
practice, than for U.S. customers. The Company generally
requires foreign distributors to provide a letter of credit to
the Company in an amount equal to the credit limit set for
accounts receivable from such foreign distributors. The letter
of credit provides for collection on accounts receivable from
the foreign distributor should the foreign distributor default
on their accounts receivable to the Company. The Company does
not require letters of credit from any of its domestic
distributors and is not protected against accounts receivable
default or bankruptcy by these distributors. The inability to
collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect the
Company’s results of operations. Termination of a
significant distributor, whether at the Company’s or the
distributor’s initiative, could be disruptive to the
Company’s current business. If the Company were unable to
find suitable replacements, terminations by significant
distributors or representatives could have a material adverse
impact on the Company. See “Item 1.,
Business — Sales and Marketing” at pages 5
and 6.

Dependence on Independent Foundries,
    Subcontractors, and the Philippines Test and Shipping
    Facility

Although the Company has an internal capability
to fabricate most of its wafers, Maxim remains dependent on
outside silicon foundries for a small but important portion of
its wafer fabrication and wafer processing for chip scale
packaging. None of the foundries currently used by Maxim is
affiliated with Maxim. As is typical in the semiconductor
industry, from time to time, the Company has experienced
disruptions in the supply of processed wafers from these
foundries due to quality problems, failure to achieve
satisfactory electrical yields, and capacity limitations.
Procurement from foundries is done by purchase order and
contracts. If these foundries are unable or unwilling to produce
adequate supplies of processed wafers conforming to the
Company’s quality standards, the Company’s business
and relationships with its customers for the limited quantities
of products produced by these foundries would be adversely
affected. Finding alternate sources of supply or initiating
internal wafer processing for these products would not be
economically feasible.

Maxim relies on assembly subcontractors located
in the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and South Korea to
separate wafers into individual integrated circuits and package
them. The Company performs wafer sort operations for about half
of its wafers and final testing for about two-thirds of its
products at a Philippines facility owned by the Company. During
fiscal year 2002, the Company transferred a significant portion
of the testing of Dallas Semiconductor product to the
Company’s test facility located in Cavite, the Philippines.
In the past, South Korea and the Philippines have experienced
political disorders, labor disruptions, and natural disasters.
Although the Company has been affected by these problems, none
has materially affected the Company’s revenues or costs to
date. However, similar problems in the future or more aggravated
consequences of current problems, could affect deliveries to
Maxim of assembled, tested product, possibly resulting in
substantial delayed or lost sales and/or increased expense. The
Thailand test facility performs about one-fourth of the
Company’s final testing for its products but would not
provide sufficient capacity to make up for a significant
disruption in the Philippines test facility. Reliability
problems are experienced by the Company’s assemblers and
could cause serious problems in delivery and quality resulting
in potential product liability to the Company.



The Company performs substantially all of its
final testing at its facilities in the Philippines and Thailand.
Given the nature of the Company’s test operations, it would
be very difficult and costly to arrange for independent testing
facilities to supply such test services. Any prolonged inability
to utilize one of the Company’s testing facilities as a
result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability of electric
power or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

As previously noted, once testing has been
completed on the Company’s product, finished product from
the Company’s test facility located in Samutprakarn
Province, Thailand is shipped to the Company’s finished
goods location at its test facility in Cavite, the Philippines.
Finished product is either shipped directly from Cavite, the
Philippines to customers worldwide or to other Company locations
for sale to end customers or distributors. See
“Item 1., Business — Manufacturing” at
pages 4 and 5. Should there be disruption for any reason to the
shipping operations in Cavite, the Philippines the Company might
not be able to meet its revenue plan in the fiscal period
impacted. Failure to meet the revenue plan may materially
adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.

Availability of Materials, Supplies, and
    Subcontract Services

Over the past few years, the semiconductor
industry has experienced a very large expansion of fabrication
capacity and production worldwide. As a result of increasing
demand from semiconductor manufacturers, availability of certain
basic materials and supplies, such as polysilicon, silicon
wafers, ultra-pure metals, lead frames and molding compounds,
and of subcontract services, like epitaxial growth and ion
implantation and assembly of integrated circuits into packages,
have from time to time, over the past few years, been in short
supply and may be expected to come into short supply again if
overall industry demand increases in the future. Maxim devotes
continuous efforts to maintain availability of all required
materials, supplies, and subcontract services. However, Maxim
does not have long-term agreements providing for all of these
materials, supplies, and services, and shortages could occur as
a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on
suppliers that could have a materially adverse effect on
Maxim’s ability to achieve its planned production.

A number of Dallas Semiconductor products,
including nonvolatile SRAMs, real time clocks, and
iButton

TM

products use static memory circuits,
batteries, PC boards, and crystals that are acquired from third
parties. The Company anticipates that from time to time supplies
of these circuits may not be sufficient to meet all customer
requested delivery dates for products containing the circuits.
As a result of any such shortages, future sales and earnings
from products using these components could be adversely
affected. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the purchase
price for these circuits could affect gross margins for the
products involved. Suppliers could also discontinue the
manufacture of such purchased products or could have quality
problems that could affect the Company’s ability to meet
customer commitments.

In addition, suppliers of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment are sometimes unable to deliver test
and/or fabrication equipment to a schedule or equipment
performance specification that meets the Company’s
requirements. Delays in delivery of equipment needed for planned
growth could adversely affect the Company’s ability to
achieve its manufacturing and revenue plans in the future.

Protection of Proprietary
    Information

The Company relies primarily upon know-how,
rather than on patents, to develop and maintain its competitive
position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop
or patent similar technology or reverse engineer the
Company’s products or that the confidentiality agreements
upon which the Company relies will be adequate to protect its
interests. Other companies have obtained patents covering a
variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and the Company
might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents
or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products,
if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no assurance
that Maxim would be able to obtain licenses, if required, upon
commercially reasonable terms. See “Item 1.,
Business — Patents, Licenses, and Other Intellectual
Property Rights” at pages 6 and 7, and
“Item 1., Trends, Risks and Uncertainties —
Intellectual Property Litigation and Claims” at
page 12.



Intellectual Property Litigation and
    Claims

The Company is subject to various legal
proceedings (See “Item 3., Legal Proceedings” at
page 15) and other similar claims that involve possible
infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of
third parties. Maxim is currently a defendant in a lawsuit
brought by Linear Technology Corporation in which Linear alleges
that Maxim has willfully infringed Linear Technology
Corporation’s patent relating to control circuits and
methods for maintaining high efficiencies over broad current
ranges in a switching regulator circuit. Linear Technology
Corporation seeks unspecified actual and treble monetary damages
and a permanent injunction against Maxim. In addition to the
above, from time to time, the Company receives notices that its
products or processes may be infringing the intellectual
property rights of others. See “Item 1.,
Business — Patents, Licenses, and Other Intellectual
Property Rights” at pages 6 and 7.

If one or more of the Company’s products or
processes were determined to infringe any such intellectual
property rights, a court might enjoin the Company from further
manufacture and/or sale of the affected products. The Company
would then need to obtain a license from the holders of the
rights and/or to reengineer the Company’s products or
processes in such a way as to avoid the alleged infringement. In
any of those cases, there can be no assurance that the Company
would be able to obtain any necessary license on commercially
reasonable terms or that the Company would be able to reengineer
its products or processes to avoid infringement. An adverse
result in litigation arising from such a claim could involve an
injunction to prevent the sales of a material portion of the
Company’s products, a reduction or the elimination of the
value of related inventories, and the assessment of a
substantial monetary award for damages related to past sales
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
result of operations and financial condition.

Insurance

The Company has insurance contracts with
independent insurance companies that provide its employees with
health (medical and dental) benefits, worker’s compensation
coverage, long term disability income coverage, life insurance
coverage, and fiduciary insurance coverage for employee and
Company funds invested under the Employee Retirement Income and
Security Act. In addition, the Company has insurance contracts
that provide officer and director liability coverage for the
Company’s officers and directors. Other than the specific
areas mentioned above, the Company is self-insured as it relates
to all other insurance risks and exposures. Based on
management’s assessment and judgment, the Company has
determined that it is more cost effective to self-insure these
risks rather than incur the insurance premium costs. The risks
and exposures the Company self insures include, but is not
limited to, fire, property and casualty, natural disaster,
product defects, political risk, general liability, patent
infringement, and employment issues. Should there be events such
as fires, explosions, or earthquakes, among many other
possibilities, or adverse court or similar decisions in any area
in which the Company is self-insured, the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be
materially adversely affected. See “Item 3., Legal
Proceedings” at page 15.

Foreign Trade and Currency
    Exchange

Many of the materials and manufacturing steps in
the Company’s products are supplied by foreign companies or
by the Company’s operations abroad, such as its test
operations in the Philippines and Thailand. Approximately 66% of
the Company’s net revenues in fiscal year 2002 were from
foreign customers. Accordingly, both manufacturing and sales of
the Company’s products may be adversely affected by
political or economic conditions abroad. In addition, various
forms of protectionist trade legislation have been proposed in
the United States and certain foreign countries. A change in
current tariff structures or other trade policies could
adversely affect the Company’s foreign manufacturing or
marketing strategies. Currency exchange fluctuations could also
increase the cost of components manufactured abroad and the cost
of the Company’s products to foreign customers or decrease
the costs of products from the Company’s foreign
competitors. Although export sales are subject to government
regulation, those regulations have not caused the Company
significant difficulties to date. See “Item 1.,
Business — Manufacturing” at pages 4 and 5,
and “Item 1., Business — Sales and
Marketing” at pages 5 and 6.



Dependence on Key Personnel

The Company’s success depends to a
significant extent upon the continued service of its president,
John F. Gifford, its other executive officers, and key
management and technical personnel, particularly its experienced
engineers, and on its ability to continue to attract, retain,
and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for such
employees is intense. The loss of the services of
Mr. Gifford or several of the Company’s executive
officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In
addition, there could be a material adverse effect on the
Company should the turnover rates for engineers and other key
personnel increase significantly or should the Company be unable
to continue to attract qualified personnel.

The Company does not maintain any key person life
insurance policy on any of its officers or employees.

Merger Transition and
    Integration

The Company acquired Dallas Semiconductor on
April 11, 2001. Since that time, the Company has been in
the process of integrating the personnel and operations of
Dallas Semiconductor, with the goals of reducing costs and
increasing efficiency and productivity. That process has been
proceeding well in most regards, but no assurance can be given
that the integration will be fully completed according to the
Company’s schedule or that the results of the remaining
integration will be successful.

Properties

Maxim’s headquarters is located in
Sunnyvale, California. Manufacturing and other operations are
conducted in several locations worldwide. The following table
provides certain information as to the Company’s principal
general offices and manufacturing facilities.

In addition to the leased property listed in the
table, the Company also leases sales, engineering, and
manufacturing offices and other premises at various locations in
the United States and overseas under operating leases. These
leases expire at various dates through the year 2010. The
Company anticipates no difficulty in retaining occupancy of any
of its manufacturing, office or sales facilities through lease
renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy
or in replacing them with equivalent facilities.

The Company expects these buildings and the
contiguous land to be adequate for its business purposes through
fiscal year 2003.



Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

Linear Technology Corporation vs. Maxim
Integrated Products, Inc. et al.,

Action No. C-98-1727 FMS in the Federal District Court for
the Northern District of California.

On June 26, 1997, a complaint was filed by
Linear Technology Corporation (“LTC”) naming the
Company and certain other unrelated parties as defendants. The
complaint alleges that each of the defendants, including the
Company, has willfully infringed, induced infringement and
contributorily infringed LTC’s United States Patent
5,481,178 relating to control circuits and methods for
maintaining high efficiencies over broad current ranges in a
switching regulator circuit, all of which has allegedly damaged
LTC in an unspecified amount.

The complaint further alleges that the
Company’s actions have been, and continue to be, willful
and deliberate and seeks a permanent injunction against the
Company as well as unspecified actual and treble damages
including costs, expenses, and attorneys fees.

The Company answered the complaint on
October 20, 1997, denying all of LTC’s substantive
allegations and counterclaiming for a declaration that
LTC’s patent is invalid and not infringed.

On September 21, 2001, the Federal District
Court for the Northern District of California issued an order
dismissing the patent litigation action by LTC. The court found
that the Company did not infringe any of the claims of the
asserted patent. The Company had moved for summary judgment on a
number of subjects, including noninfringement, invalidity and
unenforceability of the patent. The court found that the
Company’s remaining summary judgment motions were rendered
moot by its noninfringement ruling. LTC has appealed the
decision. While the Company continues to believe the claims are
without merit, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of
the appeal. The Company does not believe that the ultimate
outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on
the financial position or liquidity of the Company. If, however,
the appellate court in the action brought by LTC were to reverse
the trial court’s dismissal of the patent litigation claims
brought by LTC against the Company, and were LTC to prevail in
its claims against the Company, the Company’s operating
results could be materially adversely affected.

Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements as noted in
Item 14(a)(1).

Business Combination

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the
Company acquired Dallas Semiconductor Corporation, a leading
supplier of specialty semiconductors. The acquisition was
undertaken as a result of the Company’s belief that the
engineering talent, product offerings, and management philosophy
at Dallas Semiconductor, when combined with those of the
Company, would lead to synergies that would positively impact
operating results and increase stockholder value. The Company
issued approximately 41.0 million shares of its common
stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Dallas
Semiconductor. In addition, the Company exchanged all options to
purchase Dallas Semiconductor common stock for options to
purchase approximately 5.9 million shares of the
Company’s common stock. As was permitted under applicable
accounting rules in effect at the time, the transaction was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and qualifies as a
tax-free reorganization.

All financial data of the Company presented in
these financial statements was restated to include the
historical financial data of Dallas Semiconductor in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and pursuant to Regulation S-X of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Adjustments relating to deferral of income
on shipments to distributors were required to conform to the
accounting policies of the acquired company. The Company and
Dallas Semiconductor had certain differences in the
classification of revenues and expenses in their historical
statements of income and assets and liabilities in their
historical balance sheets. Adjustments were made to conform the
combined company’s income statement and balance sheet
classifications. In addition, the lives of the property, plant
and equipment acquired as part of the merger with Dallas
Semiconductor were conformed to the lives used by the Company as
appropriate. The change, which was prospective in nature,
reflects the Company’s anticipated economic benefit from
those assets. See Note 3 “Business Combination”
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at pages 39
and 40.

Results of Operations

Net Revenues

The Company reported net revenues of
$1,025.1 million in fiscal year 2002, a 35.0% decrease from
net revenues of $1,576.6 million in fiscal year 2001. This
decrease is primarily related to downturns in certain industry
segments (particularly telecom and information technology
businesses) and in the general economy. This downturn, which
began in fiscal year 2001, resulted in sequential
quarter-over-quarter decreases in net revenues through the first
quarter of fiscal year 2002. Order rates stabilized during the
first quarter of and throughout fiscal year 2002 resulting in
net revenues increasing slightly quarter-over-quarter from the
second quarter through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002.

The Company reported net revenues of
$1,576.6 million in fiscal year 2001, a 14.6% increase from
net revenues of $1,376.1 million in fiscal year 2000. This
increase was primarily related to higher unit shipments
resulting from continued introduction of new proprietary
products and increased market acceptance of the Company’s
existing proprietary and second-source products, and an increase
in market demand for analog semiconductor products in general.
This increased demand resulted in net revenues being greater in
the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal year 2001 than
net revenues for the comparable quarters in fiscal year 2000.
While net revenues increased from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal
year 2001, market demand for the Company’s products
decreased significantly in the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal year 2001 due to downturns in certain industry segments
(particularly telecom and information technology businesses) and
in the general economy. This resulted in net revenues’
being less in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 than the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000.



Approximately 66%, 57%, and 53% of the
Company’s net revenues in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively, were derived from customers located outside
the United States, primarily in the Pacific Rim and Europe.
While the majority of these sales are denominated in U.S.
dollars, the Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts to mitigate its risks on firm commitments and net
monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of
changes in foreign exchange rates on net revenues and the
Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2002,
2001, and 2000 was immaterial.

Gross Margin

The Company’s gross margin as a percentage
of net revenues was 69.5% in fiscal year 2002 compared to 65.9%
in fiscal year 2001. The improvement in gross margin as a
percentage of net revenues from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year
2002 was attributable to lower fixed asset and inventory charges
recorded during fiscal year 2002 as compared to fiscal year
2001. This was offset slightly by a decrease in the
Company’s gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2002 primarily as a result of revenue growth in lower margin
products. Gross margin for fiscal year 2002 was negatively
impacted by inventory write downs of $12.5 million. Gross
margin for fiscal year 2001 was negatively impacted by
$39.2 million recorded to reduce the carrying value of
plant and equipment that was abandoned, no longer in use, or
whose estimated useful lives were shortened, resulting in
accelerated depreciation, and inventory write downs of
$39.9 million. See “Critical Accounting Policies
— Inventories” at page 24.

The Company’s gross margin as a percentage
of net revenues was 65.9% in fiscal year 2001 compared to 63.4%
in fiscal year 2000. The improvement in gross margin as a
percentage of net revenues in fiscal year 2001 was principally
due to production efficiencies obtained through economies of
scale and cost reductions. The increase in gross margin for
fiscal year 2001 was offset by $39.2 million recorded to
reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was
abandoned, no longer in use, or whose estimated useful lives
were shortened, resulting in accelerated depreciation and
inventory write downs of $39.9 million. Gross margin for
fiscal year 2000 was negatively impacted by $27.1 million
recorded to reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment
that was abandoned, no longer in use, or whose estimated useful
lives were shortened, resulting in accelerated depreciation, and
inventory write downs of $3.3 million.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses were
$275.5 million and $280.2 million for fiscal years
2002 and 2001, respectively, which represented 26.9% and 17.8%
of net revenues, respectively. The decrease in research and
development expenses in absolute dollars is due to no fixed
asset charges recorded during fiscal year 2002 as compared to
fiscal year 2001. This was offset by increased headcount related
expenses to continue product development to support revenue
growth and increased wafer and mask expenses to support new
product development. Included in research and development
expenses in fiscal year 2001 was $11.2 million recorded to
reduce the carrying value of equipment, that was abandoned, no
longer in use, or whose estimated useful lives were shortened,
resulting in accelerated depreciation.

Research and development expenses were
$280.2 million and $216.8 million in fiscal years 2001
and 2000, respectively, which represented 17.8% and 15.8% of net
revenues, respectively. The increase in research and development
expenses both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage
of net revenues in fiscal year 2001 was due primarily to
increased headcount related expenses to continue product
development to support revenue growth, increased wafer and mask
expense to support new product development, and
$11.2 million recorded to reduce the carrying value of
equipment, that was abandoned, no longer in use, or whose
estimated useful lives were shortened, resulting in accelerated
depreciation. Included in research and development expenses in
fiscal year 2000 was $8.1 million recorded to reduce the
carrying value of equipment that was abandoned, no longer in
use, or whose estimated useful lives were shortened resulting in
accelerated depreciation.



The level of research and development
expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from
period to period, depending, in part, on the level of net
revenues and, in part, on the Company’s success in
recruiting the technical personnel needed for its new product
introductions and process development. The Company continuously
attempts to control and, if possible, reduce expense levels in
all areas including research and development. However, the
Company views research and development expenditures as critical
to maintaining a high level of new product introductions, which
in turn are critical to the Company’s plan for future
growth.

Selling, General and
    Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
$92.0 million and $150.6 million in fiscal years 2002
and 2001, respectively, which represented 9.0% and 9.6% of net
revenues, respectively. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses both in terms of absolute dollars and as
a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year 2002 is primarily
due to lower sales representative commissions and decreased
headcount related expenses due mainly to a reorganization of the
combined Company’s sales organization completed in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001. In addition, there was a
decrease of $5.5 million in charges recorded for technology
licensing.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
$150.6 million and $146.9 million in fiscal years 2001
and 2000, respectively, which represented 9.6% and 10.7% of net
revenues, respectively. The increase in selling, general, and
administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year 2001
was primarily due to additional headcount and related employee
expenses to support the Company’s increased level of
revenues offset by a decrease of $9.5 million in charges
recorded primarily for technology licensing.

Merger and Special Charges

As a result of the merger with Dallas
Semiconductor, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001,
the Company recorded merger costs of approximately
$26.4 million. These costs consisted of approximately
$14.1 million intended to satisfy the change in control
payments under previously existing employment contracts and
other non-employee director arrangements for which there was no
future economic benefit; a $5.8 million payment to be made
under a change in control provision in a previously existing
life insurance arrangement for which there was no future
economic benefit; and $6.5 million for fees related to
investment banking, legal, accounting, filings with regulatory
agencies, financial printing, and other related costs.
Approximately $6.6 million of the direct transaction costs
were paid out of existing cash reserves in fiscal year 2002. The
remaining unpaid direct transaction costs of approximately $1.7
million are related to change in control payments under
previously existing employment contracts and other non-employee
director arrangements which will be paid out in future periods
according to the terms of the related agreement.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001,
the Company recorded special charges of $137.0 million.
These special charges resulted from the significant decrease in
demand that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2001 for Dallas Semiconductor’s products in combination
with the Company’s intention to close Dallas
Semiconductor’s 6-inch wafer manufacturing facility and
dispose of the related equipment. The Company intends to
complete construction of an 8-inch wafer manufacturing facility
located in Dallas, Texas that was under construction when the
merger was consummated between the Company and Dallas
Semiconductor. Once complete, the 8-inch wafer manufacturing
facility will serve as Dallas Semiconductor’s primary wafer
manufacturing facility. In addition, the Company planned to
concentrate a significant portion of its test operations of the
combined company at the Company’s test facilities located
in the Philippines and Thailand. The Company concluded that the
above facts indicated that Dallas Semiconductor’s
long-lived assets might be impaired, and as required by
accounting principles general accepted in the United States,
performed a cash flow analysis of the related assets. Based on
the cash flow analysis, the cash flows expected to be generated
by Dallas Semiconductor’s long-lived assets during their
estimated remaining useful lives were not sufficient to recover
the net book value of the assets. Based on the cash flow
analysis, an impairment charge of $124.4 million was
recorded to reduce the net book value of Dallas
Semiconductor’s long-lived assets to fair value. The
Company continued construction of the 8-inch wafer manufacturing
facility located in Dallas, Texas during fiscal year 2002
although at a slower pace than originally anticipated due to
unforeseen complexities and resource constraints related to
converting existing 6-inch processes to 8-inch processes. The



Company plans to complete construction and start
up of the 8-inch wafer manufacturing facility in fiscal year
2003. The concentration of test operations of the combined
company noted above was completed in fiscal year 2002 as planned.

In addition to the above, the Company recorded
special charges of $12.6 million to reflect the
reorganization of the Company’s sales organization,
purchase order cancellation fees, and the reduction in the
Company’s manufacturing workforce. The above actions
directly impacted employees in the Company’s sales,
marketing, and manufacturing organizations. The Company
terminated 137 employees and 93 employees in fiscal
years 2002 and 2001, respectively, and paid $0.5 million
and $2.0 million in termination benefits in fiscal years
2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the above actions.

During fiscal year 2002, the Company recorded
additional special charges of $4.1 million related to
additional reductions in the Company’s manufacturing
workforce. These additional reductions were required to better
match capacity with demand for the Company’s product. In
fiscal year 2002, the Company terminated an additional 350
employees and paid an additional $4.0 million of
termination benefits related to these actions, bringing the
total number of employees terminated to 487 and the total
termination benefits paid to $4.5 million in fiscal year
2002.

Based on developments that occurred during fiscal
year 2002 related to the special charges recorded during the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company revised its
estimate of the reserve balance needed for purchase order
cancellation fees. Based on the current status of negotiations,
the amount that will ultimately be paid will be approximately
$4.3 million less than the amount recorded for such charges
at June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the Company decreased the
amount recorded for purchase order cancellation fees by
$4.3 million to reflect this change in estimate leaving a
remaining reserve balance for purchase order cancellation fees
of $3.2 million at June 29, 2002.

Interest Income and Other,
    Net

Interest income and other, net decreased to
$41.5 million in fiscal year 2002 from $59.8 million
in fiscal year 2001. This decrease was due to lower levels of
invested cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment
combined with lower average interest rates.

Interest income and other, net increased to
$59.8 million in fiscal year 2001 from $52.7 million
in fiscal year 2000. The increase in interest income and other,
net in fiscal year 2001 was primarily due to significantly
higher levels of invested cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments and higher average interest rates. Included in
interest income and other, net in fiscal year 2000 was a
$4.5 million gain from the cash sale of the Company’s
50% interest in its high-frequency packaging and assembly
subsidiary and a $5.6 million gain from the sale of an
investment in an unrelated test equipment company.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 33.0%, 33.7%, and
33.5% for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 effective rates were lower than
the U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due
to tax benefits on export sales.

Realization of the net deferred tax asset of
$108.1 million at June 29, 2002 is dependent primarily
upon achieving future U.S. taxable income of $309 million.
The Company believes it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical
earnings and expected levels of future taxable income. Levels of
future taxable income are subject to the various risks and
uncertainties discussed in
“Item 1., Business — Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties” at pages 8 through 13. An increase in
the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be
necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of
the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company
periodically assesses the need for increases to the deferred tax
asset valuation allowance.



Outlook

At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2002, backlog shippable within the next 12 months was
approximately $239 million (compared to $234 million
at the end of fiscal year 2001), including approximately
$210 million (compared to $185 million at the end of
fiscal year 2001) requested for shipment in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2003. Although the Company’s backlog grew 9% in
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, there is still limited
visibility in many of its end markets. Because the
Company’s backlog of orders at any point is not necessarily
based on firm, noncancelable orders and because the
Company’s customers do in fact routinely cancel orders for
their own convenience with little notice, backlog has limited
value as a predictor of future revenues.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002,
bookings were approximately $310 million, a 4% increase
over the previous quarter’s level of $299 million.
Turns orders remained high during the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2002 at 45% of bookings (turns orders are customer orders
that are for delivery within the same quarter and may result in
revenue within the same quarter if the Company has available
inventory that matches those orders). The Company’s
customers continue to order to support near-term requirements.
Turns orders received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2002 were $140 million. Bookings increased in the U.S. and
Japan and were approximately flat with the third quarter of
fiscal year 2002 in other geographic areas.

The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 results
were generally consistent with the Company’s expectations.
Revenues increased approximately 8% over the third quarter of
fiscal year 2002. The Company increased its revenues during the
second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2002, and the
Company forecasts that revenues will be up sequentially for the
first quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company believes that end
market consumption of its products is close to its current
bookings level. As of the end of the second week of September
2002, the Company believes that its net revenues will be
somewhat higher in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 than in
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002, but the Company does not
have sufficient visibility based on current backlog and bookings
to make confident predictions for future periods.

If the business climate does not recover to
levels the Company experienced a couple of years ago, the
Company believes it can still perform well for its stockholders.
The Company is committed to finding the right mix of operating
efficiencies and market success that will produce results for
its stockholders. To this end the Company is implementing
expense control and reduction plans throughout the Company while
at the same time continuing to focus on its new product and
process introduction plans and completion of the manufacturing
and other operational improvements discussed elsewhere in this
report.

Financial Condition

Overview

Total assets decreased to $2,010.8 million
at the end of fiscal year 2002, down from $2,430.5 million
at the end of fiscal year 2001. The decrease is primarily due to
the repurchase of 20.1 million shares of the Company’s
common stock for $864.0 million. This decrease was offset
by an increase in cash generated from operations of
$403.8 million in fiscal year 2002 and $109.3 million
from employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plan
purchases. Accounts receivable declined to $129.8 million
at the end of fiscal year 2002 from $152.5 million at the
end of fiscal year 2001, primarily due to a decrease in sales
volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 compared to the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001. Net inventory declined to
$139.2 million in fiscal year 2002 from $162.7 million
in fiscal year 2001 due to better matching of capacity with
demand. Deferred tax assets grew to $144.7 million at the
end of fiscal year 2002 from $103.2 million at the end of
fiscal year 2001 primarily due to timing differences between tax
and financial reporting.

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

The Company’s primary sources of funds for
fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000 has been from net cash
generated from operating activities of approximately
$403.8 million, $809.6 million, and
$666.3 million, respectively. In addition, the Company
received approximately $109.3 million, $114.3 million,
and $99.1 mil-



lion of proceeds from the exercises of stock
options and purchases of common stock under the Employee Stock
Participation Plan during fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

Another source of cash from the Company’s
stock option programs is the tax deductions that arise from
exercise of options. These tax benefits amounted to
$140.0 million, $238.9 million, and
$155.0 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

The principal uses of funds for fiscal years
2002, 2001, and 2000 were repurchases of $864.0 million,
$250.7 million, and $270.2 million of the
Company’s common stock, and purchases of property, plant
and equipment of $90.4 million, $336.5 million, and
$292.1 million, respectively.

In the past, it was the Company’s policy to
reduce the dilution effect from stock options by repurchasing
its common stock from time to time in amounts based on estimates
of proceeds from stock option exercises and of tax benefits
related to such exercises. That stock repurchase policy was
discontinued in the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. During
the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2002, the Company
repurchased common stock in response to actions taken by the
Securities and Exchange Commission following the extraordinary
events of September 11, 2001. During the third and fourth
quarters of fiscal year 2002, the Company repurchased common
stock as it was determined to be a more effective use of the
Company’s funds rather than reinvesting maturing
investments, which had a high rate of return, in securities that
would have yielded a much lower rate of return. The Company will
continue to repurchase its common stock in fiscal year 2003. The
number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such
repurchases will be based on several factors, including the
price of the Company’s common stock, general market
conditions, and other factors. See Note 14 “Common
Stock Repurchases” at pages 51 and 52 and Note 15
“Subsequent Event” at page 52 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements regarding repurchases of
common stock during and subsequent to fiscal year 2002.

The Company is subject to pending legal
proceedings. See Note 7 “Commitments and
Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at pages 42 and 43 for information regarding
pending patent litigation. Although the results of such legal
proceedings are unpredictable, the Company does not believe that
any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse
impact on its liquidity or financial position. If, however, the
appellate court in the action brought by Linear Technology
Corporation were to reverse the trial court’s dismissal of
the patent litigation claims brought by Linear Technology
Corporation against the Company, and were Linear Technology
Corporation to prevail in its claims against the Company, the
Company’s operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

As of June 29, 2002, the Company’s
available funds consisted of $765.5 million in cash, cash
equivalents, and highly liquid investment securities. The
Company anticipates that the available funds and cash generated
from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working
capital requirements, including its anticipated level of capital
expenditures and common stock repurchases, for the next twelve
months.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the
financial condition and results of operations is based upon the
consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on
its historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and
its beliefs of what could occur in the future given available
information. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

The methods, estimates and judgments the Company
uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results the Company reports in its
financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission has
defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that
are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations, and require the
Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that
are



inherently uncertain. Based on this definition,
the Company’s most critical accounting policies include
revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances, which
impacts the recording of revenues; valuation of inventories,
which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the
assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts
write-offs of fixed assets; accounting for income taxes, which
impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of
contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods
sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. These
policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed
further below. The Company has other key accounting policies
that either do not generally require estimates and judgments
that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that
such accounting policies would have a material impact on the
Company’s reported results of operations for a given period.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
    Allowances

Revenue from product sales to the Company’s
direct customers is recognized upon shipment, provided that
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is
fixed and determinable, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no
customer acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining
significant obligations.

A portion of the Company’s sales is made to
domestic distributors under agreements that provide the
possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product
return privileges. Given the uncertainties associated with the
levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these
distributors, the Company defers recognition of such sales until
the product is sold by the domestic distributors to their end
customers. Revenue on all shipments to international
distributors is recognized upon shipment to the distributor,
when the above criteria are met, with appropriate provision of
reserves for returns and allowances, as these distributors
generally do not have price rebate or product return privileges.
The Company estimates the provision for returns and price
rebates based on historical experience and known future returns
and price rebates. Accounts receivable from both domestic and
international distributors are recognized and inventory is
relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally
transfers upon shipment at which point the Company has a legally
enforceable right to collection under normal terms.

The Company must make estimates of potential
future product returns and sales allowances related to current
period product revenue. Management analyzes historical returns,
changes in customer demand, and acceptance of products when
evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowances.
Estimates made by the Company may differ from actual product
returns and sales allowances. These differences may materially
impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on
accounts receivable.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost,
which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis, or
market value. Because of the cyclicality of the market,
inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life
cycles, the Company writes down inventories to net realizable
value based on backlog, forecasted product demand, and
historical sales levels. Backlog is subject to revisions,
cancellations, and rescheduling. Actual demand and market
conditions may be lower than those projected by the Company.
This difference could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s gross margin should inventory write downs beyond
those initially recorded become necessary. Alternatively, should
actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those
estimated by the Company, gross margin could be favorably
impacted. During fiscal year 2002 and 2001, the Company had
inventory write downs of $12.5 million and
$39.9 million, respectively, due to decreases in backlog
and forecasted demand due to a downturn in certain industry
segments (particularly telecom and information technology
businesses) and the general economy.

The Company’s standard cost revision policy
is to continuously monitor manufacturing variances and revise
standard costs when necessary. The Company’s policy for
recording a write down of inventory is generally to write down,
at standard cost, finished goods inventory in excess of an
estimate of twelve months of demand based on backlog and
historical sales levels and work in process that is greater than
90 days old, which has no forecasted product demand.



Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of
property, plant and equipment in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.” The Company performs
periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances
exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property,
plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable. If facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property,
plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable, the Company
compares projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with
the related asset or group of assets over their estimated
remaining useful life against their respective carrying amounts.
In the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not
sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the
assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on
the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the
assets. Evaluation of impairment of property, plant and
equipment requires estimates in the forecast of future operating
results that are used in the preparation of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the
remaining economic lives of the Company’s property, plant
and equipment could differ from the Company’s estimates
used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These
differences could result in additional impairment charges, which
could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

As previously noted, in fiscal year 2001, the
Company recorded a charge of $124.4 million for the
impairment of Dallas Semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment
and test equipment. The impairment charge was determined based
on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value
attributable to such assets. Additionally, in fiscal year 2001
and 2000, the Company recorded charges of $50.4 million and
$35.2 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value
of plant and equipment that was abandoned, no longer in use, or
whose estimated useful lives were shortened, resulting in
accelerated depreciation. The charges noted above were
classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements
of income.

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS 144
supersedes SFAS 121 and requires that one accounting model
be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether
previously held and used or newly acquired. The Company adopted
SFAS 144 effective June 30, 2002 and believes that
this standard will not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

Accounting for Income Taxes

The Company records a valuation allowance to
reduce the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a
valuation allowance, historical levels of income, expectations
and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and
ongoing prudent and practicable tax planning strategies are
considered. In the event it is determined that the deferred tax
assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the
net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset
valuation allowance would be recorded. This adjustment could
increase income in the period such determination was made.
Likewise, should it be determined that all or part of the net
deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future, an
adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance could be charged to income in the period such
determination would be made. At June 29, 2002 the Company
recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax
asset of $141.7 million attributable to the expected tax
benefits on gains to be realized from the exercise of stock
options, which if and when realized, will be recorded as a
credit to additional paid-in-capital.

On a periodic basis the Company evaluates its
deferred tax asset balance for realizability. To the extent the
Company believes it is more likely than not that some portion of
its deferred tax assets will not be realized, the Company will
increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax
assets. Realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is
dependent primarily upon future U.S. taxable income. The
Company’s judgments regarding future profitability may
change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or
international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any,
may require possible material adjustments to



these deferred tax assets, resulting in a
reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period
when such determinations are made.

Contingencies

From time to time, the Company receives notices
that its products or manufacturing processes may be infringing
the patent or intellectual property rights of others. The
Company periodically assesses each matter in order to determine
if a contingent liability in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (SFAS 5),
“Accounting for Contingencies,” should be recorded. In
making this determination, management may, depending on the
nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal
counsel and technical experts. Based on the information obtained
combined with management’s judgment regarding all the facts
and circumstances of each matter, the Company determines whether
it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and
whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. Should a loss
be probable and estimable, the Company records a contingent loss
in accordance with SFAS 5. In determining the amount of a
contingent loss, the Company takes into consideration advice
received from experts in the specific matter, current status of
legal proceedings, settlement negotiations which may be ongoing,
prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and
estimates made by management be incorrect, the Company may need
to record additional contingent losses that could materially
adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.
Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management
are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur,
the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thus favorably
impacting the Company’s results of operations. See
“Item 3., Legal Proceedings” at page 15.

Item
7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates relates primarily to the
Company’s investment portfolio, which includes primarily
U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency debt securities.
Investments mature at frequent intervals during the year, at
which time the funds are available for use in the business, or
for reinvestment, as cash demands dictate. The Company places
its investments only in high-quality financial instruments,
limits the amount invested in any one institution or instrument,
and limits portfolio duration. This policy is intended to reduce
default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The Company
does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment
portfolio. The fair value of the Company’s investment
portfolio and related interest income would not be materially
impacted by a change in market interest rates of 100 basis
points, due to the primarily short-term nature of the
Company’s investment portfolio. At June 29, 2002, the
Company’s investment portfolio had an expected weighted
average return of 2.8% (5.0% at June 30, 2001) and a
weighted maturity of 147 days (303 days at
June 30, 2001).

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company transacts business in various
non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, British Pound,
and the Euro. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in
these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and
liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary. The Company has
established risk management strategies designed to protect
against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows
caused by changes in exchange rates. These strategies reduce,
but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency
exchange movements.

Currency forward contracts are used to offset the
currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated assets and
liabilities. Changes in fair value of the underlying assets and
liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of
the related currency forward contract. The net realized and
unrealized gains or losses from hedging non-U.S. dollar
denominated assets and liabilities was immaterial in fiscal year
2002. The Company had forward contracts to buy and sell foreign
currencies with a U.S. dollar equivalent of $59.3 million
at June 29, 2002. The fair value of these contracts, which
generally have maturities of less than 3 months, at
June 29, 2002 was $56.0 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1:     Nature of
Operations

Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (the Company)
designs, develops, manufactures, and markets linear and
mixed-signal integrated circuits and is incorporated in the
state of Delaware. The Company’s products include data
converters, interface circuits, microprocessor supervisors,
operational amplifiers, power supplies, multiplexers, delay
lines, real-time clocks, microcontrollers, switches, battery
chargers, battery management circuits, RF circuits, fiber optic
transceivers, sensors, and voltage references. The Company is a
global company with manufacturing facilities in the United
States, testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand, and
sales offices throughout the world. The Company’s products
are sold to customers in numerous markets, including automotive,
communications, consumer, industrial control, instrumentation,
and data processing.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the
Company acquired Dallas Semiconductor Corporation (Dallas
Semiconductor), a leading supplier of specialty semiconductors.
At the completion of the merger, Dallas Semiconductor became a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests for financial reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, and accordingly, all financial
data of the Company presented in these financial statements was
restated to include the historical financial data of Dallas
Semiconductor. See Note 3 “Business Combination”
of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding
this transaction.

Note 2:     Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. The Company has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that
ends on the last Saturday of June. Accordingly, every sixth or
seventh year will be a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal years 2002
and 2000 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2001 was a 53-week
year. The impact of the additional week on the Company’s
operating results consisted primarily of additional
salary-related expenses. These additional expenses were not
material.

Certain amounts in the prior-year financial
statements in Note 6 “Property, Plant, and Equipment”
and Note 11 “Income Taxes” of these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year’s presentation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-term
    Investments

The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and
cash equivalents consist of demand accounts, government
securities, and money market funds. Short-term investments
consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency debt
securities with original maturities beyond three months.

All of the Company’s cash equivalents and
short-term investments are considered available-for-sale. Such
securities are carried at fair market value based on market
quotes. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on securities
in this category are reported as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. The cost of securities sold is based
on the specific identification method. Interest earned on
securities is included in “Interest income and other,
net” in the consolidated statements of income.

Derivative Instruments

The Company transacts business in various
non-U.S. currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, British Pound,
and the Euro. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in
these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and
liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary. The Company has
established risk management strategies designed to protect
against



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reductions in value and volatility of future cash
flows caused by changes in exchange rates. These strategies
reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of
currency exchange movements.

Currency forward contracts that are used to hedge
exposure to variability in anticipated
non-U.S.-dollar-denominated cash flows are designated as cash
flow hedges. The maturities of these instruments are generally
less than 3 months. The Company had forward contracts to
buy and sell foreign currencies with a U.S. dollar
equivalent of $59.3 million at June 29, 2002. For
these derivatives, the effective portion of the gain or loss is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income
(loss) in stockholders’ equity and is reclassified
into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative in excess of the cumulative
change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged
item, if any, is recognized in earnings, net during the period
of change. During fiscal year 2002, the portion of hedging
instruments’ gains or losses excluded from the assessment
of effectiveness and the ineffective portions of hedges had an
immaterial impact on earnings for either cash flow or fair value
hedges.

Currency forward contracts are used to offset the
currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated assets and
liabilities. Changes in fair value of the underlying assets and
liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of
the related derivatives. The net realized and unrealized gains
or losses from hedging non-U.S. dollar denominated assets
and liabilities was immaterial in fiscal year 2002. The realized
and unrealized amounts will fluctuate based on changes in the
fair value of open contracts at the end of each reporting period.

For currency forward contracts, effectiveness of
the hedge is measured using forward rates to value the forward
contract and the forward value of the underlying hedged
transaction. Any ineffective portions of the hedge, as well as
amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, are
recognized currently in interest and other income, net. If a
cash flow hedge were to be discontinued because it is probable
that the original hedged transaction will not occur as
anticipated, the unrealized gains or losses would be
reclassified into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the
related derivative instrument would be recognized in income in
each period until the instrument matures, is terminated or is
sold. In fiscal year 2002 no cash flow hedges were discontinued
as a result of forecasted transactions that did not occur.

As of June 29, 2002, the Company had forward
exchange contracts with a cost basis of $59.3 million and
an estimated fair value of $56.0 million.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost,
which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis, or
market value. Because of the cyclicality of the market,
inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life
cycles, the Company writes down inventories to net realizable
value based on backlog, forecasted product demand, and
historical sales levels. The Company’s policy for recording
a write down of inventory is generally to write down, at
standard cost, finished goods inventory in excess of an estimate
of twelve months of demand based on backlog and historical sales
levels and work in process that is greater than 90 days
old, which has no forecasted product demand.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 2 to
40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the
related lease. The Company evaluates the recoverability of
property, plant and equipment in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.” The Company performs
periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances
exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property,
plant and equipment



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exceeds their fair values. If facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property,
plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable, projected
undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or
group of assets over their estimated remaining useful life is
compared against their respective carrying amounts. In the event
that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are written
down to their estimated fair values based on the expected
discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts
    Receivables Allowances

Revenue from product sales to the Company’s
direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is
fixed and determinable, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no
customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining
significant obligations.

A portion of the Company’s sales is made to
domestic distributors under agreements that provide the
possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product
return privileges. Given the uncertainties associated with the
levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these
distributors, the Company defers recognition of such sales until
the product is sold by the domestic distributors to their end
customers. Revenue on all shipments to international
distributors is recognized upon shipment to the distributor,
when the above criteria are met, with appropriate provision of
reserves for returns and allowances, as these distributors
generally do not have price rebate or product return privileges.
The Company estimates the provision for returns and price
rebates based on historical experience and known future returns
and price rebates. Accounts receivable from both domestic and
international distributors are recognized and inventory is
relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally
transfers upon shipment at which point the Company has a legally
enforceable right to collection under normal terms.

Based on historical returns, changes in customer
demand, and acceptance of products, the Company records product
return and sales allowances to current period revenue as needed.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and
included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expenses were
$13.6 million, $18.7 million, and $17.1 million
in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Shipping Costs

Shipping costs are charged to cost of goods sold
as incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation and
    Remeasurement

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
the Company’s foreign operations. Using the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured at the year-end exchange rates. Certain non-monetary
assets and liabilities are remeasured using historical rates.
Statements of operations are remeasured at the average exchange
rates during the year. Net gains and losses from foreign
currency remeasurements have been minimal and are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Employee Stock Plans

The Company accounts for its stock option and
employee stock purchase plans in accordance with provisions of
the Accounting Principles Board’s Opinion No. 25
(APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” In addition, the Company discloses pro forma
information related to its stock plans according to Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123
(SFAS 123), “Accounting for Stock Based



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Compensation. See Note 9 “Employee
Stock and Benefit Plans” of these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share incorporates the incremental
shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The
number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of stock
options is calculated applying the treasury stock method. See
Note 10 “Earnings Per Share” of these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Boards issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141 (SFAS 141), “Business Combinations”,
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(SFAS 142) “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”. SFAS 141 requires the use of the purchase
method for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001, and provides new criteria for determining
whether an acquired intangible asset should be recognized
separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 eliminates the
amortization of goodwill and replaces it with an impairment-only
model. The provisions of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. The Company adopted SFAS 141 and 142 effective
June 30, 2002 and believes that these standards will not
have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. SFAS 144
supersedes SFAS 121 and addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the long-lived assets to be held and used, and
disposed of. The statement will be effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The Company adopted SFAS 144
effective June 30, 2002 and believes that this standard
will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146 (SFAS 146), “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS 146
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with an exit activity, including restructuring, or
with a disposal of long-lived assets. Exit activities include,
but are not limited to, eliminating or reducing product lines,
terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant
facilities or personnel. SFAS 146 specifies that a company
will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can
be measured at fair value. Therefore, commitment to an exit plan
or a plan of disposal expresses only management’s intended
future actions and, therefore, does not meet the requirement for
recognizing a liability and the related expense. SFAS 146 is
effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier adoption
encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS 146 effective
June 30, 2002 and believes that this standard will not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Such estimates relate to the useful lives and fair value
of fixed assets, allowances for doubtful accounts and customer
returns, inventory reserves, potential reserves relating to
litigation matters, accrued liabilities, and other reserves.



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Actual results may differ from those estimates,
and such differences may be material to the financial statements.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Due to the Company’s credit evaluation and
collection process, bad debt expenses have not been significant.
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited,
because a large number of geographically diverse customers make
up the Company’s customer base, thus spreading the credit
risk. While a significant portion of the Company’s revenues
is made through domestic and international distributors, no
single customer has accounted for greater than 10% of net
revenues in the last three fiscal years.

The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments with various high credit quality
financial institutions, limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one financial institution or instrument, and is exposed to
credit risk in the event of default by these institutions to the
extent of amounts recorded at the balance sheet date. To date,
the Company has not incurred losses related to these investments.

Concentration of Other Risks

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures, and
cyclical market patterns. The Company’s results of
operations are affected by a wide variety of factors, including
general economic conditions, both at home and abroad; economic
conditions specific to the semiconductor industry and to the
analog portion of that industry; demand for the Company’s
products; the timely introduction of new products;
implementation of new manufacturing technologies; manufacturing
capacity; the ability to manufacture efficiently; the
availability of materials and supplies; competition; the ability
to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly
evolving market; and reliance on assembly and, to a small
extent, wafer fabrication subcontractors and on independent
distributors and sales representatives. As a result, the Company
may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in
future operating results due to the factors mentioned above or
other factors.

Note 3:     Business
Combination

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the
Company acquired Dallas Semiconductor, a leading supplier of
specialty semiconductors. The Company issued approximately
41.0 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all
the outstanding common stock of Dallas Semiconductor. In
addition, the Company exchanged all options to purchase Dallas
Semiconductor common stock for options to purchase approximately
5.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The
transaction was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and
qualifies as a tax-free reorganization. As a result of the
acquisition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the
Company recorded merger costs of $26.4 million. In
addition, the Company recorded special charges of
$137.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001.
The special charges resulted from the significant decrease in
demand that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2001 for Dallas Semiconductor products in combination with the
Company’s plan for the utilization of Dallas
Semiconductor’s long-lived assets. See “Merger and
Special Charges” in Note 13 of these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

All financial data of the Company presented in
these financial statements was restated to include the
historical financial data of Dallas Semiconductor in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and pursuant to Regulation S-X of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Adjustments relating to deferral of income
on shipments to distributors were required to conform the
accounting policies of the acquired company. Both the Company
and Dallas Semiconductor have sales to domestic distributors
under agreements that provide for certain price rebates,
allowances and return privileges. The Company defers recognition
of these sales until the merchandise is sold by the domestic
distributors. Dallas Semiconductor recognized these sales, which
were reduced by estimated future price reductions and



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

returns, upon shipment to domestic distributors.
These adjustments reflect the conformity of Dallas
Semiconductor’s accounting policies and presentation to
that of the Company’s.

The Company and Dallas Semiconductor had certain
differences in the classification of revenues and expenses in
their historical statements of operations and assets and
liabilities in their historical balance sheets. Adjustments have
been made to conform the combined companies’ income
statement and balance sheet classifications. In addition, the
lives of the property, plant and equipment acquired as part of
the merger with Dallas Semiconductor were conformed to the lives
used by the Company as appropriate. The change, which was
prospective in nature, reflects the Company’s anticipated
economic benefit from those assets.

The Company’s statement of income for the
fiscal year ended June 24, 2000 was combined with the
Dallas Semiconductor statement of income for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000. The Company’s statement of
income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 includes the
results of operation for Dallas Semiconductor for the
12 months ended June 30, 2001. This presentation has
the effect of including Dallas Semiconductor’s results of
operations for the 6-month period ended December 31, 2000
in both the Company’s fiscal year ended June 24, 2000
and June 30, 2001. Net revenues and net income for Dallas
Semiconductor for the 6-month period ended December 31,
2000, were $270.4 million and $48.9 million,
respectively. The net income for Dallas Semiconductor for the
6-month period ended December 31, 2000, of
$48.9 million has been reported as a decrease to the
Company’s fiscal year 2001 retained earnings within the
Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity for the year
ended June 30, 2001.

The combined periods for the Consolidated
Statements of Income are summarized as follows:

The results of operations previously reported by
the separate entities and the combined amounts presented in the
accompanying financial statements are summarized below:

Investments

In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 115 (SFAS 115),
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,” the Company recorded an unrealized holding
gain of $3.2 million on short-term investments at
June 29, 2002 ($7.2 million at June 30, 2001).
The unrealized holding gain resulted from a decline in interest
rates that occurred during fiscal year 2002. Fair market values
are calculated based upon prevailing market quotes at the end of
each fiscal year.

Available-for-sale investments, all of which have
contractual maturities of one year or less, at June 29,
2002 were as follows:

Available-for-sale investments at June 30,
2001 were as follows:

Gross realized gains or losses for fiscal years
2002, 2001, and 2000 were immaterial.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

At June 29, 2002, and June 30, 2001,
the Company held forward exchange contracts, all having
maturities of less than one year, to exchange various foreign
currencies for U.S. dollars in the amount of $59.3 million
and $63.6 million, respectively. The table below
summarizes, by currency, the notional amounts of the
Company’s forward exchange contracts and net unrealized
gain or loss at the end of fiscal years 2002 and 2001. The net
unrealized gain or loss approximates the carrying value of these
contracts.



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The net unrealized gain, if any, is potentially
subject to market and credit risk as it represents appreciation
of the hedge position over the spot exchange rates at year-end.

During fiscal year 2001, the Company recorded
charges of $39.2 million to cost of goods sold and
$11.2 million to research and development costs to reduce
the carrying value of plant and equipment that was abandoned, no
longer in use, or whose estimated useful lives were shortened,
resulting in accelerated depreciation. In addition, in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company recorded
impairment charges of $124.4 million related to the
long-lived assets of Dallas Semiconductor. See Note 13
“Merger and Special Charges” of these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal year 2000, the
Company recorded charges of $27.1 million to cost of goods
sold and $8.1 million to research and development costs to
reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was
abandoned, no longer in use, or whose estimated useful lives
were shortened, resulting in accelerated depreciation.

Note
7:     Commitments and
Contingencies

On June 26, 1997, a complaint was filed by
Linear Technology Corporation (“LTC”) naming the
Company and certain other unrelated parties as defendants. The
complaint alleges that each of the defendants, including the
Company, has willfully infringed, induced infringement and
contributorily infringed LTC’s United States
Patent 5,481,178 relating to control circuits and methods
for maintaining high efficiencies over broad current ranges in a
switching regulator circuit, all of which has allegedly damaged
LTC in an unspecified amount. The complaint further alleges that
the Company’s actions have been, and continue to be,
willful and deliberate and seeks a permanent injunction against
the Company as well as unspecified actual and treble damages
including costs, expenses, and attorneys fees. The Company
answered the complaint on



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

October 20, 1997, denying all of LTC’s
substantive allegations and counterclaiming for a declaration
that LTC’s patent is invalid and not infringed.

On September 21, 2001, the Federal District
Court for the Northern District of California issued an order
dismissing the patent litigation action by LTC. The court found
that the Company did not infringe any of the claims of the
asserted patent. The Company had moved for summary judgment on a
number of subjects, including noninfringement, invalidity and
unenforceability of the patent. The court found that the
Company’s remaining summary judgment motions were rendered
moot by its noninfringement ruling. LTC has appealed the
decision. While the Company continues to believe the claims are
without merit, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of
the appeal. The Company does not believe that the ultimate
outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on
the financial position or liquidity of the Company. If, however,
the appellate court in the action brought by LTC were to reverse
the trial court’s dismissal of the patent litigation claims
brought by LTC against the Company, and were LTC to prevail in
its claims against the Company, the Company’s operating
results could be materially adversely affected.

In addition to the above, the Company is subject
to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal
course of its business. The Company does not believe that the
ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse
effect on the financial position of the Company.

The Company leases certain of its facilities
under various operating leases that expire at various dates
through 2010. The lease agreements generally include renewal
provisions and require the Company to pay property taxes,
insurance, and maintenance costs.

Future annual minimum lease payments for all
leased facilities are as follows:

Rent expense was approximately $3.0 million,
$3.7 million, and $2.7 million in fiscal years 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively.

Stock Option Plan, 1987 Employee Stock Participation Plan (ESP
Plan), 1988 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan, and
Supplemental Nonemployee Stock Option Plan. Under the plans,
options are generally granted at a price not less than fair
market value as determined by the Board or Plan administrator at
the date of grant. Subject to certain limitations, the Board or
Plan administrator has authority to make grants at prices less
than fair market value. Options granted under the stock option
plans described above generally vest within 5 years and
expire from 5 to 10 years from the date of the grant or
such shorter term as may be provided in the agreement. Under the
1987 Employee Stock Participation Plan and, until April 11,
2001, the Dallas Semiconductor Stock Purchase Plan, employees of
the Company may purchase shares of common stock at a price not
less than the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the
stock on the date the purchase right is granted or the date the
right is exercised. During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded
$139,987,000 of tax benefit on the exercise of nonqualified
stock options and on disqualifying dispositions under stock
plans ($238,934,000 in fiscal year 2001 and $154,958,000 in
fiscal year 2000).

Information with respect to activity under the
stock option plans and ESP Plan is set forth below:

At June 29, 2002, 36,116,676 options to
purchase shares of common stock were exercisable. Options
exercisable at June 30, 2001 and June 24, 2000 were
33,070,686 and 32,811,193, respectively.

if the Company had accounted for its employee
stock options (including shares issued under the 1996 Stock
Incentive Plan, 1993 Officer and Director Stock Option Plan,
1987 Stock Option Plan, 1987 Supplemental Stock Option Plan,
1988 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan, and Supplemental
Nonemployee Stock Option Plan, collectively called
“options”) granted subsequent to June 30, 1995,
under the methodology prescribed by that statement. Since the
Company has elected to account for the grant of options under
APB Opinion No. 25, the following information is for
disclosure purposes only.

The valuation of options granted in fiscal years
2002, 2001, and 2000 reported below has been estimated at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that
have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company’s options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the estimate of value, in the opinion of
management, the existing models do not provide a reliable single
measure of the value of the options. The following is a summary
of weighted average grant date values generated by application
of the Black-Scholes model:

As required under SFAS 123, the reported net
income and earnings per share have been presented to reflect the
impact had the Company been required to include the amortization
of the Black-Scholes option value as an expense. The adjusted
amounts are as follows:

401(k) Retirement Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan
(401(k) Plan) under which full-time U.S. employees may
contribute, on a pretax basis, between 1% and 20% of their total
annual income from the Company, subject to a maximum aggregate
annual contribution imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
Company contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $2.6 million,
$3.0 million, and $2.5 million in fiscal years 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Note 10:     Earnings
Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings per share:

Approximately 11.8 million,
3.9 million, and 1.0 million of the Company’s
stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. These options were excluded, as they were
antidilutive; however, such options could be dilutive in the
future.

Note 11:     Income
Taxes

The provision for income taxes consists of the
following:

Pretax income from foreign operations was
approximately $22.7 million, $9.2 million, and
$17.4 million for the years ended June 29, 2002,
June 30, 2001, and June 24, 2000, respectively.

The Company enjoys tax holidays with respect to
its operations in Thailand and certain of its operations in the
Philippines. Some of the Company’s tax holidays expired in
fiscal year 2002 and some will expire in fiscal year 2004. The
impact of these tax holidays was to increase net income by
approximately $1.6 million ($0.005 diluted earnings per
share), $1.1 million ($0.003 diluted earnings per share),
and $2.7 million ($0.008 diluted earnings per share) during
fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. At
June 29, 2002,



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accumulated pretax earnings of approximately
$17.7 million are intended to be permanently reinvested
outside the United States, and no federal tax has been provided
on these earnings.

The provision for income taxes differs from the
amount computed by applying the statutory rate as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. The components of the
Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as
follows:

The valuation allowance of $141.7 million is
attributable to the tax benefits on gains realized from the
exercise of stock options, and when realized, will be recorded
as a credit to additional paid-in-capital. Realization of the
net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company’s
ability to generate future taxable income.

Note 12:     Segment

The Company operates and tracks its results in

Note 13:     Merger
and Special Charges

As a result of the merger with Dallas
Semiconductor, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001,
the Company recorded merger costs of approximately
$26.4 million. These costs consist of approximately
$14.1 million intended to satisfy the change in control
payments under previously existing employment contracts and
other non-employee director arrangements for which there was no
future economic benefit; a $5.8 million payment to be made
under a change in control provision in a previously existing
life insurance arrangement for which there was no future
economic benefit; and $6.5 million for fees related to
investment banking, legal, accounting, filings with regulatory
agencies, financial printing, and other related costs.
Approximately $6.6 million of the direct transaction costs
were paid out of existing cash reserves in fiscal year 2002. The
remaining unpaid direct transaction costs of approximately
$1.7 million are related to change in control payments
under previously existing employment contracts and other
non-employee director arrangements that will be paid out in
future periods according to the terms of the related agreement.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001,
the Company recorded special charges of $137.0 million.
These special charges resulted from the significant decrease in
demand that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2001 for Dallas Semiconductor’s products in combination
with the Company’s intention to close Dallas
Semiconductor’s 6-inch wafer manufacturing facility and
dispose of the related equipment. The Company intends to
complete construction of an 8-inch wafer manufacturing facility
located in Dallas, Texas that was under construction when the
merger was consummated between the Company and Dallas
Semiconductor. Once complete, the 8-inch wafer manufacturing
facility will serve as Dallas Semiconductor’s primary wafer
manufacturing facility. In addition, in fiscal year 2001, the
Company planned to concentrate a



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

significant portion of its test operations of the
combined company at the Company’s test facilities located
in the Philippines and Thailand. The Company concluded that the
above facts indicated that Dallas Semiconductor’s
long-lived assets might be impaired, and as required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
performed a cash flow analysis of the related assets. Based on
the cash flow analysis, the cash flows expected to be generated
by Dallas Semiconductor’s long-lived assets during their
estimated remaining useful lives were not sufficient to recover
the net book value of the assets. Based on the cash flow
analysis, an impairment charge of $124.4 million was
recorded to reduce the net book value of Dallas
Semiconductor’s long-lived assets to fair value. The
Company continued construction of the 8-inch wafer manufacturing
facility located in Dallas, Texas during fiscal year 2002
although at a slower pace than originally anticipated due to
unforeseen complexities and resource constraints related to
converting existing 6-inch processes to 8-inch processes. The
Company plans to complete construction and start up of the
8-inch wafer manufacturing facility in fiscal year 2003. The
concentration of test operations of the combined company noted
above was completed in fiscal year 2002 as planned.

In addition to the above, the Company recorded
special charges of $12.6 million to reflect the
reorganization of the Company’s sales organization,
purchase order cancellation fees, and the reduction in the
Company’s manufacturing workforce. The above actions
directly impacted employees in the Company’s sales,
marketing, and manufacturing organizations. The Company
terminated 137 employees and 93 employees in fiscal
years 2002 and 2001, respectively, and paid $0.5 million
and $2.0 million in termination benefits in fiscal years
2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the above actions.

During fiscal year 2002, the Company recorded
additional special charges of $4.1 million related to
additional reductions in the Company’s manufacturing
workforce. These additional reductions were required to better
match capacity with demand for the Company’s product. In
fiscal year 2002, the Company terminated an additional
350 employees and paid an additional $4.0 million of
termination benefits related to these actions, bringing the
total number of employees terminated to 487 and the total
termination benefits paid to $4.5 million in fiscal year
2002.

Based on developments that occurred during fiscal
year 2002 related to the special charges recorded during the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company revised its
estimate of the reserve balance needed for purchase order
cancellation fees. Based on the current status of negotiations,
the amount that will ultimately be paid will be approximately
$4.3 million less than the amount recorded for such charges
at June 30, 2001. Accordingly, the Company decreased the
amount recorded for purchase order cancellation fees by
$4.3 million to reflect this change in estimate leaving a
remaining reserve balance for purchase order cancellation fees
of $3.2 million at June 29, 2002.

Note 14:     Common
Stock Repurchases

First and Second Quarters of Fiscal Year

Following the extraordinary events on
September 11, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued an Emergency Order pursuant to Section 12(k)(2) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This Emergency Order was
issued to temporarily ease the restrictions of Rule 10 b-18
during the five business days following the opening of the U.S.
securities market on September 17, 2001. The Emergency
Order also provided that, despite pooling-of-interests
provisions in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16,

Business Combinations,

and the related interpretations of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
consensuses of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Emerging Issues Task Force, rules and regulations of the
Commission and interpretations by its staff, and other
authoritative accounting guidance, a company could continue to
account for its business combination transactions as a
pooling-of-interests if it repurchased its own common stock
pursuant to the Emergency Order. Subsequently, the Securities
Exchange Commission extended this Emergency Order to
September 28, 2001. As a result of the Emergency Order, the
Company authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million
shares of its common stock for the ten business days following
the opening of the U.S. securities markets on September 17,
2001. During the period from September 17, 2001 to
September 28, 2001, the Company repurchased approximately
8.2 million shares of its common stock for
$286.6 million.

On September 28, 2001, the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued an Exemptive Order to respond to
market developments. Similar to its previously issued Emergency
Order, the Exemptive Order eased the restrictions of Rule 10b-18
and provided that, despite pooling-of-interests provisions in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16,

Business
Combinations,

and the related interpretations of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, consensuses
of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging
Issues Task Force, rules and regulations of the Commission and
interpretations by its staff, and other authoritative accounting
guidance, a company could continue to account for its business
combination transactions as a pooling-of-interests if it
repurchased its own common stock pursuant to the Exemptive Order
during the period from October 1, 2001 to October 12,
2001. On October 1, 2001 the Company increased the number
of shares authorized to be repurchased to 15 million, and
during the period from October 1, 2001 to October 12,
2001, the Company repurchased 2.0 million shares of its
common stock for $67.8 million. To the extent that



MAXIM INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Board’s authorization on October 1,
2001 to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock was
not fully executed by October 12, 2001, that authorization
was rescinded.

Third and Fourth Quarters of Fiscal Year

Due to decreases in market interest rates that
occurred during fiscal 2002, in combination with investments
maturing during the six months ended June 29, 2002, which
had a high rate of return that would have been reinvested at a
much lower rate of return, the Company determined it would be a
more effective use of its funds to repurchase its common stock
rather than reinvesting maturing amounts. Given prevailing
market interest rates combined with the market price of the
Company’s common stock, the Company concluded that
repurchases of common stock would be accretive to earnings. In
light of the above, on February 28, 2002, the Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common
stock from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s
management. The Board of Directors further defined this
authority during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
2002, when it approved extensions of the share repurchase
authorization announced on February 28, 2002. These
extensions authorize the Company to repurchase up to
20 million shares of its common stock from time to time
between the dates of such authorization and the end of the
Company’s fiscal year 2003.

During the six months ended June 29, 2002,
the Company repurchased approximately 10.0 million shares
of its common stock for $509.6 million. As of June 29,
2002, approximately 10.9 million shares remained available
under the repurchase authorization. The number of shares to be
repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on
several factors, including the price of the Company’s
common stock, general market and business conditions, and other
factors.

Note
15:     Subsequent Event
(Unaudited)

During the period June 30, 2002 through

2.0 million shares for $69.0 million.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as of
June 29, 2002 and June 30, 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended June 29, 2002. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a).These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We did not audit the financial statements and schedule
of Dallas Semiconductor Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary,
which statements and schedule reflect total assets of
$728.4 million as of December 31, 2000, total revenues
of $517.0 million for the year then ended and Additions
Charged to Costs and Expenses, Deductions, and a Balance at End
of Period of $1,000, $4,000, and $477,000 as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2000 respectively. Those statements and
schedule were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to data
included for Dallas Semiconductor for the year ended
December 31, 2000, is based solely on the report of the
other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and
the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the
report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., at
June 29, 2002 and June 30, 2001, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 29, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.
