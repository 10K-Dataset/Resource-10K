Item 1A.RISK FACTORS

Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a
material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may
also impair our business operations. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Food safety and food-borne illness concerns throughout the supply chain may have an adverse effect on our business.

Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our customers enjoy safe, quality
food products. However, food safety issues could be caused by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A,
trichinosis or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne
illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at







restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety
issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.

Litigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity,
could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales.

We are subject to a number of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our
business, including in the areas of health care reform, environmental matters, minimum wage, data privacy, menu labeling, immigration requirements and taxes, and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost
structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability.

The restaurant industry is subject to
extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental,
traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and
regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages, unionization and other labor issues.
These include the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime, family leave, tip credits, working conditions and safety standards. They also include the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which requires among other
things the preparation of Form I-9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the United States.







We also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.
Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our
reputation. New or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our cost of labor.

We are reviewing the Health Care Reform Law. As part of that review, we will evaluate the potential impacts of this
new law on our business, and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance. We did
not receive tax-free subsidies for providing prescription drugs to retirees under Medicare Part D. Therefore, we have no deferred tax assets associated with our retiree medical plan that would be impacted by this law. The Health Care Reform Law also
requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision, but cannot anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from the
implementation of this portion of the law, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by
U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified
array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other
environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and
fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card
numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial
condition.

The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations
that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our cost
structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in,
among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental
investigations or proceedings.

We may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.

Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working
conditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor
shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from
offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers’ compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors’
and officers’ liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. The dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high
per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of
uninsured losses.







We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure,
inadequacy, interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.

We rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including for management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing system in our restaurants, and various other processes and
transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate
effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could
result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual. This could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft.” Each of these situations
or data privacy breaches may cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation.

Our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a
hurricane or manmade disaster, including terrorism, at our corporate facility could materially adversely impact our business.

Many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Florida location.We have disaster recovery procedures and business
continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are
unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and
other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.

Health concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our
business.

We face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results
of operations would be adversely affected.

The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry
is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. We







compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants. We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery,
deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value
perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants, type of brand, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that
intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our failure to drive sufficient profitable sales growth through brand relevance, operating excellence, opening new restaurants and
developing or acquiring new dining brands could result in poor financial performance.

The ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the
identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor
licenses) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability to manage union activities such as
picketing or hand billing which could delay construction, increases in labor and building material costs, the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays
and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with
other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and
lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods.

We incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance
the RARE acquisition, which may decrease our business flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.

We incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the RARE acquisition. Although our adjusted debt to adjusted
total capital ratio has fallen to near pre-acquisition levels, it remains higher than it was before the acquisition. Our increased indebtedness and higher adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio, as compared to that which existed on a
historical basis, may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs.

Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it may:







•require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and reduce our
ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;

•limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, additional acquisitions or general corporate
requirements, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and

•limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions
as compared to our competitors.

There are various financial covenants and other
restrictions in our debt instruments. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt instruments
may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.

Our ability to make
scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors
beyond our control.

Our plans to expand our newer brands Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 and the testing of synergy
restaurants that have not yet proven their long-term viability may not be successful, which could require us to make substantial further investments in those brands and test formats and result in losses and impairments.

While each of our restaurant brands, as well as each of our individual restaurants, are subject to the risks and
uncertainties described above, there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the operation and expansion of our newer brands such as Bahama Breeze and Seasons 52 and the testing of new restaurant formats such as synergy restaurants.
These brands and test formats have not yet proven their long-term viability or growth potential. We have made substantial investments in the development and expansion of each of these brands and test formats, and further investment is required.
While we have implemented a number of changes to operations at Bahama Breeze, and believe we have improved the guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart modest unit growth, there can be no assurance that these changes will continue
to be successful or that additional new unit growth will occur. Seasons 52 also is in the early stages of its development and will require additional resources to support further growth. There likewise can be no assurances that the testing of the
synergy restaurant format will prove successful. In each case, these brands and formats will continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand or format.

A lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current
restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

The success of our restaurants
depends in large part on their locations. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic
conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable
cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and
remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.

Our sales
and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants. We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant
and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing restaurants. The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect
on our results of operations.







Increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our results of
operations.

If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our
advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Inadequate or ineffective
advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.

A failure to develop and
recruit effective leaders, the loss of key personnel or a significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.

Our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees. Our
future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our
current business and support our projected growth. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence and build adequate bench strength required for growth, a loss of key employees or a
significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.

The
price and availability of key food products, ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants and a failure to achieve economies of scale in purchasing could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

We may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the
delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers.

Possible shortages or
interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain
solvent given disruptions in the financial markets, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. We may have a limited number of suppliers
for certain of our products. Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations. If we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s
menu, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining habits.

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in
our gross margins and net earnings.

We use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our
principal ingredient and energy costs, including but not limited to coffee, butter, wheat, soybean oil, pork, beef, diesel fuel, gasoline and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in
volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings included in our consolidated financial statements. We may experience volatile earnings
as a result of these accounting treatments.







Certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other
general macroeconomic factors including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates that are largely out of our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations.

Our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our
control. The full service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including
changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. The performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including
hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.

General economic
conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations. Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates or other industry-wide cost
pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause customers to make fewer discretionary
purchases, and any significant decrease in our customer traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card,
home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out, may spend less on each dining out occasion, or may choose more inexpensive
restaurants.

Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist
attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or
consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.

Unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical
limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns, affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses.







and assumed rates are not accurate, our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to
employees under the pension plan.

We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees, business
partners and vendors in foreign markets.

Our expansion into international markets could create risks
to our brands and reputation. We believe that we have selected high-caliber international operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and provide them with training and support. However, the ultimate
success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If the franchisee does not successfully operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or customers have negative experiences due to issues with food
quality or operational execution, our brand values could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

There also is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue. Our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with
our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, and differing cultures and consumer preferences.

We also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our
international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.

We regard our Darden Restaurants®, Red Lobster®, Olive Garden®, LongHorn Steakhouse®, The Capital Grille®, Bahama
Breeze®, and Seasons 52®service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts.
We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement.
We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons. Although our
policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective
intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance
that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.

Impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.







We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible
assets, primarily the LongHorn Steakhouse®and The Capital Grille®trademarks, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires
significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory
environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

As with goodwill, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) for impairment annually and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of the trademarks based on an income valuation model using the relief from royalty method, which requires assumptions
related to projected sales from our annual long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate.

We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial
condition and consolidated results of operations.

Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future
changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results, affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant
companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could
limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor
confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.

A change in accounting standards can have a
significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing
accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our
financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to,
revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, derivatives, pension and post-retirement benefits, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment,
unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-based compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,
estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.
