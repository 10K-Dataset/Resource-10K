PART I

Items 1 and 2.  Business and Properties

Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA), Malaysia, and Norway.  The Bakken Midstream operating segment, which was established in the second quarter of 2015, provides fee-based services, including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, and the storage and terminaling of propane, primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota.  In July 2015, we sold a 50% interest in Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) for net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion.  HIP and its affiliates primarily comprise the Bakken Midstream operating segment.

In 2013, we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play E&P company. These initiatives represented the culmination of a multi-year strategic transformation designed to leverage our lean manufacturing capabilities across unconventional assets, exploit our deepwater drilling and project development capabilities, and execute a smaller, more targeted exploration program.  This transformation was completed in 2015.

Proved Reserves

Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.  Crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at December 31, 2015 were $55.10 per barrel for Brent (2014: $101.35) and $50.13 per barrel for WTI (2014: $94.42).  Negative reserve revisions resulting from lower crude oil prices in 2015 reduced proved reserves at December 31, 2015 by 234 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), and represent the primary reason for the decrease in total proved reserves year-on-year.  These negative revisions represent primarily proved undeveloped reserves that were not economically producible at the stipulated lower prices.

Our total proved developed and undeveloped reserves at December 31 were as follows:

(a)Total proved reserves of natural gas liquids were 101 million barrels (proved developed - 63 million barrels; proved undeveloped – 38 million barrels) at December 31, 2015, and 145 million barrels (proved developed - 65 million barrels; proved undeveloped - 80 million barrels) at December 31, 2014.  Of the total proved natural gas liquids reserves, 72% were in the U.S. and 28% were in Norway at December 31, 2015 (2014:  82% and 18%, respectively).  Natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil.  See the average selling prices in the table on page 8.

(b)Reflects natural gas reserves converted on the basis of relative energy content of six mcf equals one barrel of oil equivalent (one mcf represents one thousand cubic feet).  Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence, as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past.  See the average selling prices in the table on page 8.

(c)Proved reserves in Norway, which represented 21% of our total reserves at December 31, 2015 (2014: 20%), were as follows:

Proved undeveloped reserves were 27% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2015 on a boe basis (2014: 47%).  Proved reserves held under production sharing contracts totaled 5% of our crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves, and 44% of our natural gas reserves at December 31, 2015 (2014:  5% and 49%, respectively).

E&P Operations

A description of our significant E&P operations is as follows:

United States

Our production in the U.S. was from onshore properties, principally in the Bakken oil shale play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota, the Utica Basin of Ohio, the Permian Basin of Texas and offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico.

Onshore:

Bakken:At December 31, 2015, we held 583,000 net acres in the Bakken.  During 2015, we operated an average of 8.5 rigs, drilled 182 wells, completed 212 wells, and brought on production 219 wells, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,201.  In 2016, we plan to operate an average of 2 rigs to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 wells on production.  The improved efficiency of our drilling operations can largely be attributed to application of our lean manufacturing capabilities.

Utica:We own a 50% working interest in approximately 50,000 net acres in the wet gas area of the Utica Basin of Ohio.  During 2015, a total of 24 wells were drilled, 32 wells were completed and 32 wells were brought on production.  In June 2015, we and our joint venture partner reduced drilling activity to a single Hess operated rig, and in 2016 we plan to suspend drilling activities after we bring onto production 14 wells.  In 2015, we sold approximately 13,000 acres of Utica dry gas acreage for consideration of approximately $120 million.

Permian:We operate and hold a 34% interest in the Seminole‑San Andres Unit in the Permian Basin.

Offshore:At December 31, 2015, we held interests in 108 blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.  Our production offshore in the Gulf of Mexico was principally from the Tubular Bells (Hess 57%), Shenzi (Hess 28%), Llano (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Baldpate (Hess 50%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%) and Penn State (Hess 50%) fields.  In addition, we are operator of the Stampede development project (Hess 25%) and have interests in non-operated exploration blocks including Sicily (Hess 25%) and Melmar (Hess 35%).  At December 31, 2015, we held 75 exploration blocks containing approximately 250,000 net undeveloped acres of which leases for 46 exploration blocks containing 165,000 net undeveloped acres are due to expire in the next three years.  During 2015, our interests in 73 exploration blocks expired or were relinquished.










Descriptions of our significant operationsin the Offshore, U.S. is as follows:

Tubular Bells:  At this Hess operated field, we achieved our first full year of production following first oil in late 2014. Four production wells have been completed to date.  In 2016, we intend to complete one water injector well, drill one production well, perform two wellbore stimulations, and complete a workover on a third well to open a stuck subsurface safety valve.

Shenzi:At this BHP Billiton Petroleum operated field, drilling continued during 2015 with the completion of two production wells and one appraisal well.  In 2016, the operator plans to complete a water injection well.

Stampede:At this Hess operated project in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, the co-owners sanctioned the field development and committed to two deepwater drilling rigs in 2014.  The first rig is expected to commence drilling in the first quarter of 2016 and the second rig is expected to commence drilling in the first quarter of 2017.  Construction of production facilities and subsea equipment is underway, with first production from the field targeted for 2018 at an expected net rate of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).

Sicily:At this Chevron operated prospect in the Keathley Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the operator successfully completed drilling and logging activities of its initial exploration well in 2015.  The discovery well was drilled to a depth of 30,214 feet and is being evaluated.  Drilling of an appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery commenced in December 2015.

Melmar:At this ConocoPhillips operated prospect in the Alaminos Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the operator commenced drilling of an initial exploration well in December 2015.

Europe

Norway:At the BP operated offshore Valhall Field (Hess 64%), in 2015 the operator drilled one well and completed three wells.  In the first quarter of 2013, the operator completed the installation of a new production, utilities and accommodation platform that extended the field life by approximately 40 years.  In 2016,the operator is expected to continue a multi-year well abandonment program.

Denmark:At the Hess operated offshore South Arne Field (Hess 62%), we expect to complete drilling of a previously sanctioned eleven well multi-year program in the first quarter of 2016.

Africa

Equatorial Guinea:At the Hess operated offshore Block G (Hess 85% paying interest, national oil company of Equatorial Guinea5% carried interest), we have production from the Okume and Ceiba Fields.  In 2015, we deferred the remaining portion of an infill drilling program on the Okume Field.

Algeria:Prior to its sale on December 31, 2015, we had a 49% interest in a venture with the Algerian national oil company that redeveloped three onshore oil fields.

At the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license (Hess 50% license interest), we have drilled seven successful exploration wells on the block since 2011.  In May 2013, we submitted appraisal plans for each of the seven discoveries, which comprise both oil and natural gas, to the Ghanaian government for approval.  Five appraisal plans have been approved and discussions continue with the Ghanaian government to receive approval on the remaining two appraisal plans.  In 2014, we drilled three successful appraisal wells.  Well results continue to be evaluated and development planning is progressing.  The government of Côte d’Ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of Ghana, which includes a portion of our Deepwater Tano

/

Cape Three Points license.  We are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the license.  The International Tribunal for Law of the Sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017.  Under terms of our license, the deadline to declare commerciality for the Pecan Field, which would be the primary development hub for the block, is in March 2016, and the deadline to submit a plan of development is in September 2016.  We have requested an extension of the submission deadline for a plan of development for the Pecan Field, and will continue to work with the government on how best to progress work on the Block given the maritime border dispute.

for details of wells capitalized at December 31, 2015 and previously capitalized well costs charged to expense in 2015.

Libya:At the onshore Waha concession in Libya, which include the Defa, Faregh, Gialo, North Gialo and Belhedan Fields (Hess 8%), the operator shut in production in 2015 and for much of 2014 due to civil unrest.  Net production averaged 4,000 bopd in 2014 and 13,000 bopd in 2013.  Since December 2014, the national oil company of Libya has declared force majeure with respect to the Waha concession.  We have after-tax net book value in our Libyan operations of approximately $120 million and total proved reserves of 159 million boe at December 31, 2015.








Asia and Other

Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA):At the Carigali Hess operated offshore Block A-18 in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%),the operator continued development drilling in 2015 and made progress on a booster compression project that is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2016.

Malaysia:Our production in Malaysia comes from our interest in Block PM301 (Hess 50%), which is adjacent to and is unitized with Block A‑18 of the JDA and our 50% interest in Blocks PM302, PM325 and PM326B located in the North Malay Basin (NMB), offshore Peninsular Malaysia, where we operate a multi‑phase natural gas development project.  NMB achieved first production in October 2013 from an Early Production System.  We expect net production to increase from approximately 40 million cubic feet per day in 2016 to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day following the completion of full field development in 2017.

Australia:At the WA‑390‑P Block (Hess 100%) in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia (also known as Equus) covering approximately 780,000 acres, we have drilled 13 natural gas discoveries.  In late 2014, we executed a non-binding letter of intent with a potential liquefaction partner and began joint front-end engineering studies in 2015.  Discussions with potential long-term purchasers of liquefied natural gas were also initiated in 2015.  Successful negotiation of a binding agreement with the third-party liquefaction partner is necessary before we can execute a gas sales agreement and sanction development of the project.  At our adjacent WA-474-P Block (Hess 100%), which could become part of the Equus project, we plan to drill a commitment well in 2016.  SeeCapitalized Exploratory Well CostsinNote 5, Property, Plant and Equipmentin theNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsfor details of wells capitalized at December 31, 2015 and previously capitalized well costs charged to expense in 2015.

Guyana:At the Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited operated offshore Stabroek Block (Hess 30% participating interest), the operator announced a significant oil discovery at the Liza-1 well in the second quarter of 2015.  The operator plans to drill two appraisal wells, including one sidetrack with a production test, and two exploration wells in 2016.  A new 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic shoot is near completion and the operator, along with its partners, continues to evaluate the resource potential of the block.

Kurdistan Region of Iraq:We relinquished our interests at the Hess operated Dinarta Block (80% paying interest, 64% working interest), and exited operations in the region in 2015.

Canada:In 2014 we acquired a 40% participating interest in four exploration licenses offshore Nova Scotia.  We expect the operator, BP, to drill the first exploration well in 2017 and a second exploration well in 2018.

Sales Commitments

We have contracts to sell fixed quantities of our natural gas and natural gas liquids production.  The natural gas contracts principally relate to producing fields in Asia.  The most significant of these net commitments relates to the JDA where the minimum contract quantity of natural gas is estimated at 48 billion cubic feet per year based on current entitlements under a sales contract with the national oil companies of Malaysia and Thailand expiring in 2027.  At the North Malay Basin development project, we have a commitment to deliver a minimum of 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2033 from full field development start-up, which is expected in 2017.  The Company’s estimated total volume of production subject to sales commitments is approximately 0.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  We also have natural gas liquids delivery commitments in the Bakken and Permian Basin of Texas through 2023 of approximately 9 million barrels per year, or approximately 97 million barrels over the life of the contracts.

We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments, and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves and projected third-party supply.

Ramberg truck facility and crude oil rail cars), and a 100% interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (owner of the Mentor storage terminal).

Marketing and Refining - Discontinued Operations

As of December 31, 2015, our downstream activities had substantively ceased:

·2015:We completed the sale of our former energy trading joint venture, HETCO.

·2014:We sold our retail marketing business consisting of approximately 1,350 retail gasoline stations, most of which had convenience stores, and two joint venture investments in natural gas fueled electric generating projects in Newark and Bayonne, New Jersey.

·2013:We sold our energy marketing and terminal network businesses; which marketed refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity on the East Coast of the U.S., primarily to wholesale distributors, industrial and commercial users, and public utilities.  We also permanently shut down the refining operations at our Port Reading, New Jersey facility, thus completing our exit from all refining operations.

Our subsidiary, HOVIC, had a 50% interest in HOVENSA (a joint venture with a subsidiary of PDVSA) which owned a refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  In January 2012, HOVENSA shut down its refinery and continued operating solely as an oil storage terminal through the first quarter of 2015.  In September 2015, HOVENSA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands - Bankruptcy Division.  In December 2015, the Government of St. Croix ratified a new operating agreement with the buyer of HOVENSA’s storage terminals, refining units, and marine infrastructure (St. Croix Facility) and in January 2016, the buyer completed the purchase of the assets of the St. Croix Facility.  Under the court approved Liquidation Plan, HOVENSA established a liquidating trust to distribute certain assets and sale proceeds to its creditors, established an environmental response trust to administer to HOVENSA’s remaining environmental obligations and will conduct an orderly wind-down of its remaining activities.

Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures

We have in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities.  These plans are risk appropriate and are maintained, reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability.  Where appropriate, they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities.

Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans.  Our contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented.

We continue to participate in a number of industry‑wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods.  The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes.

Insurance Coverage and Indemnification

We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, general liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage.  This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.

The amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding Atlantic Named Windstorm coverage for which we are self‑insured, varies by asset, based on the asset's estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss.  In the case of a catastrophic event, first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance.  The first $300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group.  Above this $300 million threshold, insurance is carried which ranges in value up to $2.89 billion in total, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above.  Additionally, we carry insurance that provides third-party coverage for general liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to $1.08 billion, which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest.

Our insurance policies renew at various dates each year.  Future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations.  In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable.

Generally, our drilling contracts (and most of our other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and Contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property (and, often, those of its contractors/subcontractors) regardless of fault.








Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party.  Third‑party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis.

We are customarily responsible for, and indemnify the Contractor against, all claims including those from third‑parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property (regardless of cause, including gross negligence and willful misconduct) and the Contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the Contractor’s property.  Additionally, we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third‑party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs, blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist.  Lastly, some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the Contractor’s liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount.

Under a standard joint operating agreement (JOA), each party is liable for all claims arising under the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator).  Variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of the operator, in which case the operator is solely liable.  The parties to the JOA may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third-parties in some jurisdictions.  Further, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several.

Environmental

Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal, state, local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.  We spent approximately $13 million in 2015 for environmental remediation.  The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.  For further discussion of environmental matters seeEnvironment, Health and SafetyinItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Number of Employees

At December 31, 2015, we had 2,770 employees.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks, including the risk factors described below.  These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments.  It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future.

There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated.Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves.  Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues.  In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors.  Crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 resulting in a significant reduction to our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015.  If crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further, it could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the








value of our business.  SeeCrude Oil and Natural Gas ReservesinCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesinItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.We conduct many of our E&P operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement.  There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest.  Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.  In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.

Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations.  We transport some of our crude oil production, particularly from the Bakken shale oil play, by rail.  Recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny.  In the wake of these accidents, several U.S. government agencies have issued safety advisories or emergency orders requiring rail carriers to take additional precautionary measures when shipping crude oil by rail.  In 2015, the Department of Transportation issued new standards for tank car design which could require HIP to retrofit or upgrade its existing fleet of tank cars.  The requirements of these new regulatory actions, as well as other possible regulations or voluntary measures by the rail industry aimed at increasing rail safety, may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations.

The exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs, which may not be fully funded from operations.  For example, in 2015, we had a net loss attributable to Hess Corporation of $3,056 million, and if commodity prices remain low through 2016, we are forecasting a net loss for 2016.  Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating.  In January 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed our BBB credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative.  In February 2016, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to BBB- with stable outlook and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered our credit rating to Ba1 with stable outlook, which is below investment grade.  Although, currently we do not have any borrowings under our long-term credit facility, further ratings downgrades, continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing, or impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk.

Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business.Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, geographic territorial border disputes, corruption, security risks and labor unrest.  Political and civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally.  The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry.

Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities.Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage.  Our operations are also subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations.  Non‑compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities.  In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.  Similarly, we have material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases.  These estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties.

Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions.  While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new








regulations on such drillingoperations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.

Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business.We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.  In addition, our production is used to produce petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases.  Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes, revenues and margins.  The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business.

Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have.The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive.  We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas.  Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources.  We are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy.  Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets.  In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs.

Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‑made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions.Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects.  Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, such as the third-party accident at the Macondo prospect, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‑attacks.  Although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.  Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.

Significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences.We are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated.  Such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions.  This may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events.  These delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows.

Departures of key members from our senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals.The derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management.  Moreover, an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or, in part, with a commensurate impact on shareholder value.

We are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor.  An inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences.The availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry.  As a result, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost.  These consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences.

We manage commodity price risk through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons.We may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines.  These arrangements may, depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved, limit any potential upside from commodity price increases.  In addition, as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement.

Cyber‑attacks targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry








may materiall

y impact our business and operations.

Computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business.  We use these systems to analyze and store financial

and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners.  Cyber

‑attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and propr

ietary information.  In addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.  A cyber

‑attack against these operating systems, or the networks and

infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.  As a result, a

cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.  We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems.  Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any

material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on

our business and operations.  In addition, as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks.
