ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that we believe could impact our business and future results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report. In addition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.

We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government customers. The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal2017,2016and2015was approximately74 percent,77 percentand66 percent, respectively. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government would significantly reduce our revenue. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the










We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a government fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenue based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenue or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.

In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government’s convenience upon payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and










requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government contracts.

We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.

•Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and, therefore, our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;

•Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our employees, including trade secrets, which could be used to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;

•Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions;

•Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result;

•Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and

•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. Government) and the public generally.

Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The U.S. Government’s budget deficit, the national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The U.S. Government’s budget deficit, the national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways, including the following:

•The U.S. Government could reduce or delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in which we participate;

•The U.S. Government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and thus would be required either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a “continuing resolution” that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for products and services we










provide, which may decrease our revenue, profitability or cash flows or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;

•U.S. Government spending could be impacted by sequestration or alternate arrangements, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in predicting, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels; and

•We may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by economic difficulties of our customers and prospective customers, including U.S. Federal, state and local governments.

The level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.

A substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, “defined benefit plans”), as a result of our acquisition of Exelis. We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to defined benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our defined benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves various factors and uncertainties during those periods that can be volatile and unpredictable, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, mortality of plan participants and trends for future medical costs. We develop our assumptions using relevant plan experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.

We will make contributions to fund our defined benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall defined benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.

U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. As a result, we expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the U.S. Government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions.

On December 27, 2011 the U.S. Government’s Cost Accounting Standards Board published a final rule that harmonizes CAS pension cost reimbursement rules with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) funding requirements. The rule is expected to eventually mitigate the mismatch between CAS costs and PPA-amended Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) minimum funding requirements, and result in an acceleration of allowable CAS pension costs as compared to the prior rules. The final rule applied to Exelis’ contracts starting in 2013, including a five-year phase in. The full phase-in was achieved in 2017. We anticipate that government contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional CAS contract costs resulting from the final rule, although we can give no assurances in this regard.

We enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.

We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.

Accounting for our contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, judgments










associated with estimating contract revenue and costs, and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, we must make assumptions regarding: (i) the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; (ii) whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented; (iii) incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates, and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and (iv) estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.



We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. The percentage of our total revenue represented by revenue from products and services exported from the U.S., including foreign military sales, or manufactured or rendered abroad in fiscal2017,2016and2015was22 percent,20 percentand29 percent, respectively. Approximately20 percentof our international business in fiscal2017was transacted in local currency. Losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and a significant portion of our business activity is being conducted with or in, less-developed countries and sometimes countries with unstable governments, or in areas of military conflict or at military installations. We are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:

•Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and currency revaluations;

•The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);

•Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in export controls and other trade regulations;

•Changes in regulatory requirements, including business or operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or embargoes;

•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees;

•Risk of non-payment or delayed payment by foreign governments;

•Contractual obligations to non-U.S. customers may include specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or financial or other support arrangements or obligations, known as offset obligations, that may extend over several years, may require teaming with local companies and may result in significant penalties if not satisfied;

•The complexity and necessity of using, and disruptions involving our, international dealers, distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•The difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed organization and culturally diverse workforces, including compliance with local laws and practices;

•Difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;

•Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract terms;

•Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; and

•Increased risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our facilities or products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties.

Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.

We have implemented compliance controls, policies and procedures designed to prevent reckless or criminal acts from being committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, such as the FCPA, and to detect any such reckless or criminal acts committed. We cannot ensure, however, that our controls, policies and procedures will prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts, and we have been adversely impacted by such acts in the past. If not prevented, such reckless or criminal acts could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and suspension and debarment by the U.S. Government and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, our results of










operations and our reputation. In addition, misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer’s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation and could adversely impact our ability to continue to contract with the U.S. Government.

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies outside of the U.S. For example, the U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 to 60 days, depending on the size and location of the proposed sale, prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.

Our businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

•Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;

•Develop and maintain competitive products, systems, services and technologies;

•Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or other features that differentiate our products, systems, services and technologies from those of our competitors; and

•Develop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly.

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

We participate in U.S. and international markets that are subject to uncertain economic conditions. In particular, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration and potential alternative funding arrangements. In addition, certain of our non-U.S. customers, including in the Middle East and other oil or natural-gas producing countries, could be adversely affected by weakness or volatility in oil or natural gas prices, or negative expectations about future prices or volatility, which could adversely affect demand for tactical communications or other products. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of or guidance relating to future revenue, income and expenditures even more difficult. As a result, we may make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits.

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.

Ongoing instability and current conflicts in global markets, including in the Middle East and Asia, and the potential for other conflicts and future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events throughout the world, including the pending voluntary exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), have created economic and political uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. These matters cause uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase the political, economic and










social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate. These matters may cause us to incur increased costs or experience difficulty with future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or financing activities. These matters also may cause our insurance coverages and performance bonds to increase in cost, or in some cases, to be unavailable altogether.

We have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that involve significant risks and uncertainties.

Strategic acquisitions and divestitures that we have made in the past, and may continue to make, present significant risks and uncertainties, which include:

•Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions, including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other acquisition risks;

•Difficulty and expense in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings, and in entering into new markets in which we are not experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration;

•Difficulty and expense in consolidating and rationalizing IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;

•Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;

•Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;

•Risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•Risk that indemnification related to divested businesses that we may be required to provide to acquirers of such businesses or that applicable purchase price adjustments related to such divestitures may be significant and could negatively impact our business;

•Risk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions, including non-competition arrangements applicable to certain of our business lines, or within expected timeframes;

•Potential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses acquired or to be divested; and

•Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations.

Disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.










Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved from time to time is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

From time to time, we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.



Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:

•The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;

•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

•Increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process R&D and impairment of goodwill or other long-term assets in connection with acquisitions;

•Changes in available tax credits;

•Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;

•Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and










•The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

Our level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our unfunded defined benefit plans liability may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.

At the end of fiscal


, we had

$3.9 billion

in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt and approximately

$1.3 billion

of unfunded defined benefit plans liability. In the future we may increase our borrowings; however, our ability to do so will be subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness as well as any future debt that we may incur and our ability to make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due or make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; reducing our cash dividend rate and/or share repurchases; or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense technology industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.

The credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt securities.

Unforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have significant operations in locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant business operations are located in Florida, which is subject to the risk of major hurricanes. Our worldwide operations and operations of our suppliers could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers










or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.

As part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, such assumptions and judgment may prove to have been inaccurate and unforeseen issues could arise, which could adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounted for approximately

53 percent

of our recorded total assets as of

June 30, 2017

. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually, as well as when we change reporting units and when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. Because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on accounting policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report and

Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies

and

Note 8: Goodwill

in the Notes.

Some of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.

Approximately 600 of our U.S. employees are unionized, which represented approximately 4 percent of our employee-base at the end of fiscal2017. As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor collective bargaining agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

Our business has a continuing need to attract and retain significant numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding security clearances, to support our growth and to replace individuals whose employment has terminated due to retirement or other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet.

Risks Relating to the Spin-off of Vectrus Completed by Exelis

On September 27, 2014, before being acquired by Harris, Exelis completed the spin-off of Vectrus, Inc. (“Vectrus”). After the spin-off, Exelis and Vectrus operated independently of each other and neither company had an ownership interest in the other. Prior to the completion of the spin-off, Exelis and Vectrus entered into a Distribution Agreement and related separation agreements that provided mechanisms for an orderly separation and govern the post-separation relationship between Exelis and Vectrus. These agreements generally provide that each party is responsible for its respective assets, liabilities and obligations following the spin-off, including employee benefits, intellectual property, IT, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities. The agreements also set forth Exelis’ obligation to provide Vectrus with certain temporary transition services. The agreements include the Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement and several intellectual property agreements. The following are among the risks we face in connection with the spin-off of Vectrus completed by Exelis:

We may be responsible for U.S. Federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off of Vectrus completed by Exelis.

In connection with the spin-off of Vectrus, completed by Exelis prior to our acquisition of Exelis, Exelis received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made in the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinion. Furthermore, the opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion and such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion, the spin-off is determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off transaction is taxable, each holder of Exelis common stock who received










shares of Vectrus in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received, thereby potentially increasing such holder’s tax liability. Even if the Vectrus spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to holders of Exelis common stock who received shares of Vectrus in the spin-off) in certain circumstances if subsequent significant acquisitions of Exelis stock or the stock of Vectrus were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Vectrus spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial.

In connection with the Vectrus spin-off, Vectrus indemnified Exelis for certain liabilities and Exelis indemnified Vectrus for certain liabilities. This indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by Vectrus and Vectrus may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.

As part of the Distribution Agreement, Exelis and Vectrus indemnified each other with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and breaches of the Distribution Agreement or related separation agreements. There can be no assurance that the indemnity from Vectrus will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities, or that Vectrus will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Vectrus has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Vectrus any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. In addition, performance on indemnities that Exelis provided Vectrus may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Vectrus spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.

The Vectrus spin-off could be challenged under various U.S. state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Exelis did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including, without limitation, returning assets or Vectrus shares to Exelis or providing Exelis with a claim for money damages against Vectrus in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Exelis and the fair market value of Vectrus at the time of the spin-off.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Exelis was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of Vectrus common stock.

The distribution by Exelis of the Vectrus common stock in the spin-off also could be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Indiana Business Corporation Law, a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. No assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution by Exelis of Vectrus common stock in the spin-off was unlawful. Each of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Relating to the Spin-off of Exelis from ITT Corporation

In 2011, ITT Corporation (“ITT”) completed a transaction resulting in the spin-off of Exelis and Xylem, Inc. (“Xylem”). After the spin-off, Exelis, ITT and Xylem operated independently of each other and none of the companies had any ownership interest in the other. In order to govern certain ongoing relationships between Exelis, ITT and Xylem following the spin-off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, Exelis, ITT and Xylem executed various agreements that govern the ongoing relationships between and among the three companies after the spin-off and provide for the allocation of employee benefits, income taxes, and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the spin-off. The executed agreements include the Distribution Agreement, Benefits and Compensation Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, several real estate matters agreements and Master Transition Services Agreement.

The Distribution Agreement provides for certain indemnifications and cross-indemnifications among Exelis, ITT and Xylem. The indemnifications address a variety of subjects, including indemnification by ITT of Exelis in respect of certain asserted and unasserted asbestos or silica liability claims. These indemnifications include claims relating to the presence or alleged presence of asbestos or silica in products manufactured, repaired or sold prior to the distribution date, subject to limited exceptions with respect to certain employee claims. These indemnifications also include claims relating to the presence or










alleged presence of asbestos or silica in the structure or material of any building or facility, subject to exceptions with respect to employee claims relating to Exelis or Xylem buildings or facilities. The indemnifications are absolute and indefinite. The indemnification associated with pending and future asbestos and silica claims does not expire. There can be no assurance, however, that ITT will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations.

The Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exelis, ITT and Xylem after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. Federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Exelis has joint and several liability with ITT and Xylem to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. Federal income taxes of the ITT consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which Exelis was part of that group. However, the Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this liability for which Exelis bears responsibility, and ITT and Xylem agree to indemnify Exelis against any amounts for which Exelis is not responsible. Though valid as between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the IRS.

The following are among the risks we face in connection with Exelis’ spin-off from ITT:

The ITT spin-off of Exelis may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.

Exelis’ spin-off from ITT could be challenged under various U.S. state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the ITT spin-off left Exelis, ITT and/or Xylem insolvent or with unreasonably small capital, or that Exelis, ITT and/or Xylem intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that ITT did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the ITT spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the ITT spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

If we are required to indemnify ITT or Xylem in connection with the ITT spin-off of Exelis, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted.

Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the ITT spin-off and certain other agreements among Exelis, ITT and Xylem, ITT and Xylem agreed to indemnify Exelis from certain liabilities, and Exelis agreed to indemnify ITT and Xylem for certain liabilities as discussed further above. Indemnities that we may be required to provide ITT and Xylem may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from ITT and Xylem will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ITT or Xylem will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
