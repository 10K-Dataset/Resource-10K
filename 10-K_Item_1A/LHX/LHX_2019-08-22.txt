ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.

We have described many of the trends and other factors that we believe could impact our business and future results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report. In addition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.








We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government customers, primarily defense-related programs with the DoD and a

broad range of programs with the U.S. intelligence community and other U.S. Government departments and agencies. The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal2019,2018and2017was approximately77 percent,75 percentand74 percent, respectively. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government (in particular, the DoD) would significantly reduce our revenue and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other contractors. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek will be awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government has increasingly relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to multiple competitive bidding processes, including multi-vendor IDIQ, GWAC, General Services Administration Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. We operate in highly competitive markets. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split with competitors, as well as the risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. The current competitive environment has resulted

in an increase of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders, which typically extends the time until work on a contract can begin. Following any contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding.

Our U.S. Government programs must compete with programs managed by other government contractors and with other policy imperatives for consideration for limited resources and for uncertain levels of funding during the budget and appropriations process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts) and potential alternative funding arrangements. A change in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on our current or future business. Any inability of the U.S. Government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year and consequently having to operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a “continuing resolution” or shut down, also could have material adverse consequences on our current or future business. For more information regarding sequestration, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Considerations — Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks” of this Report.

We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Over its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. In recent years, U.S.

Government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a government fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often initially receive only partial funding, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations process ultimately approved by Congress and the President or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions, as applicable. The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.

Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be








reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenue based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenue or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.

In addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government’s convenience upon payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. For some contracts, we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, and in those arrangements, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contractor for convenience without regard for our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that one or more of our U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under those circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our U.S. Government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the U.S. Government has and may continue to implement initiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices. These initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way U.S. Government contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed, which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. Government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, contracts awarded under the DoD’s Other Transaction Authority for research and prototypes generally require cost-sharing and may not follow, or may follow only in part, standard U.S. Government contracting practices and terms, such as the FAR and Cost Accounting Standards.

Failure to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws and regulations, including those related to procurement integrity, export control (including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”)), U.S. Government security, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government contracts.

The U.S. Government’s budget deficit and the national debt, as well as any inability of the U.S. Government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year and consequently having to shut down or operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a “continuing resolution,” could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the U.S. Government, what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry and whether annual appropriations bills for all agencies will be enacted for U.S. Government fiscal 2020. The U.S. Government’s budget deficit and the national debt could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways, including the following:

•The U.S. Government could reduce or delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in which we participate;

•U.S. Government spending could be impacted by alternate arrangements to sequestration, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in predicting, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels; and

•We may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by economic difficulties of our customers and prospective customers, including U.S. Federal, state and local governments.

Furthermore, we believe continued budget pressures could have serious negative consequences for the security of the U.S., the defense industrial base and the customers, employees, suppliers, investors and communities that rely on companies in the defense industrial base. Budget and program decisions made in this environment would have long-term implications for L3Harris and the entire defense industry.

We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion, insider threats or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.

We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or insider








•Disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and, therefore, our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;

•Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our employees, including trade secrets, which could be used to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;

•Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions;

•Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result;

•Result in costs which exceed our insurance coverage and/or indemnification arrangements;

•Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and

•Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. Government) and the general public.

We must also rely on the safeguards put in place by customers, suppliers, vendors, subcontractors or other third parties to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions. These third parties may have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with government contractors, such as L3Harris, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. In the event of a breach affecting these third parties, our business and financial results could suffer materially. With respect to our commercial arrangements with these third parties, we have processes designed to require that the third parties and their employees and agents agree to maintain certain standards for the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a third party’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a third party’s data protection processes, which may not be as sophisticated as ours, or a cyber attack on a third party’s information network and systems.

Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our ability to successfully manage ongoing business and organizational changes could impact our business results.

We have recently undergone several significant business and organizational changes, including the L3Harris Merger. In addition, competition to retain or recruit talent can be heightened during a time when we are experiencing significant changes. Effectively managing these business and organizational changes is critical to retaining talent, servicing customers and our business success overall. The failure to effectively manage such changes could adversely impact our business or financial results.








Our results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts. In particular, our fixed-price contracts could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.

We generate revenue through various fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material contracts. For a general description of our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated thereunder and of cost-reimbursable versus fixed-price contracts, see “Item 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts” of this Report. For a description of our revenue recognition policies, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition” of this Report.

In fiscal 2019, approximately 27 percent of Harris’ revenue was derived from cost-plus and time-and-material contracts.  Substantially all of our cost-plus contracts and time-and-material contracts are with U.S. Government customers, while sales to foreign government and commercial customers are generally transacted under fixed-price sales arrangements and are included in our fixed-price contract sales. For a cost-plus contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract’s fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels established by our customers. On a time-and-material contract, we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (which include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.

We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We are dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. The percentage of our total revenue represented by revenue from products, systems and serviceswhere the end consumer is located outside the U.S., including foreign military sales through the U.S. Government,in fiscal2019,2018and2017was22 percent,23 percentand25 percent, respectively. Approximately18 percentof our international business in fiscal2019was transacted in local currency. Losses resulting from currency rate








fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and a significant portion of our business activity is being conducted with or in, less-developed countries and sometimes countries with unstable governments, or in areas of military conflict or at military installations. Other risks of doing business internationally include:

•Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and currency revaluations;

•The laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);

•Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, including ITAR, as well as unforeseen changes in export controls and other trade regulations;

•Changes in regulatory requirements, including business or operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or embargoes;

•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees;

•Risk of non-payment or delayed payment by foreign governments;

•Contractual obligations to non-U.S. customers may include specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or financial or other support arrangements or obligations, known as offset obligations, that may extend over several years, may require teaming with local companies and may result in significant penalties if not satisfied;

•The complexity and necessity of using, and disruptions involving our, international dealers, distributors, sales representatives and consultants;

•The difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed organization and culturally diverse workforces, including compliance with local laws and practices;

•Difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;

•Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract terms;

•Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; and

•Increased risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our facilities or products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties.

The level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.

A substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, “defined benefit plans”). We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to defined benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our defined benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves various factors and uncertainties during those periods that can be volatile and unpredictable, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, mortality of plan participants and trends for future medical costs. We develop our assumptions using relevant plan experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. These assumptions and other actuarial assumptions may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.

We will make contributions to fund our defined benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall defined benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.

U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. As a result, we expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the U.S. Government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions; however, pension plan cost recoveries under our U.S. Government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made. These timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.

On December 27, 2011, the U.S. Government’s Cost Accounting Standards Board published a final rule that harmonizes CAS pension cost reimbursement rules with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) funding requirements. The rule is expected to eventually mitigate the mismatch between CAS costs and PPA-amended Employee Retirement Income Security Act








of 1974 (“ERISA”) minimum funding requirements and result in an acceleration of allowable CAS pension costs as compared to the prior rules. The final rule included a five-year phase in. We anticipate that government contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional CAS contract costs resulting from the final rule, although we can give no assurances in this regard.

We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

We must first obtain export and other licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies outside of the U.S. For example, the U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 to 60 days, depending on the size and location of the proposed sale, prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or delay certain sales. Our ability to obtain these licenses and authorizations timely or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. Government policies or laws or delays in Congressional action due to geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be reversed, prevented or delayed, and any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Disputes with our subcontractors or the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our products, systems or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.

We have implemented compliance controls, training, policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts from being committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, such as the FCPA, the protection of export controlled or classified information, such as ITAR, false claims, procurement integrity, cost accounting and billing, competition, information security and data privacy and the terms of our contracts. This risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We cannot ensure, however, that our controls, training, policies and procedures will prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts, and we have been adversely impacted by such acts in the past. If not prevented, such reckless or criminal acts could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and suspension and debarment by the U.S. Government and could have a material adverse effect on our








ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our reputation. In addition, misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer’s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation and could adversely impact our ability to continue to contract with the U.S. Government.

Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.

Our businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

•Identify market needs and growth opportunities;

•Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;

•Identify additional uses for our existing technology to address customer needs;

•Develop and maintain competitive products, systems, services and technologies;

•Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or other features that differentiate our products, systems, services and technologies from those of our competitors;

•Develop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly;

•Enhance product designs for export and releasability to international markets; and

•Effectively structure our businesses to reflect the competitive environment, including through the use of joint ventures, collaborative agreements and other forms of alliances.

We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

We participate in U.S. and international markets that are subject to uncertain economic conditions. In particular, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration and potential alternative funding arrangements. In addition, certain of our non-U.S. customers, including in the Middle East and other oil or natural gas-producing countries, could be adversely affected by weakness or volatility in oil or natural gas prices, or negative expectations about future prices or volatility, which could adversely affect demand for tactical communications, electronic systems or other products, systems, services or technologies. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of or guidance relating to future revenue, income and expenditures even more difficult. As a result, we may make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits.

We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.

Ongoing instability and current conflicts in global markets, including in the Middle East and Asia, and the potential for other conflicts and future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events throughout the world, including new or








increased tariffs and potential trade wars and the pending voluntary exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), have created economic and political uncertainties and impacts that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. These matters cause uncertainty in the world’s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase the political, economic and social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate. If credit in financial markets outside of the U.S. tightened, it could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products, systems and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments. These matters may cause us to incur increased costs or experience difficulty with future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or financing activities. These matters also may cause our insurance coverages and performance bonds to increase in cost, or in some cases, to be unavailable altogether.

We continue to monitor Brexit and its potential impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility in foreign currencies is expected to occur as the United Kingdom exits from the European Union. If the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union terminates without an agreement, there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods. The United Kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. This potential scenario is usually referred to as a “hard Brexit.” In the case of a hard Brexit, our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain, the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the United Kingdom could have an adverse impact on our consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow. Harris generated 1 percent of its fiscal 2019 net revenues in the United Kingdom, and L3 generated 6 percent of its calendar year 2018 net revenues in the United Kingdom.

Strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures we have made in the past and may make in the future present significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which include:

•Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other merger or acquisition risks;

•Difficulty and expense in integrating newly merged or acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings, and in entering into new markets in which we are not experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration;

•Difficulty and expense in consolidating and rationalizing IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various mergers and acquisitions and integrating software code;

•Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from mergers and acquisitions;

•Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;

•Risk that we assume or retain, or that companies we have merged with or acquired have assumed or retained or otherwise become subject to, significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties;

•Risk that indemnification related to businesses divested or spun off that we may be required to provide or otherwise bear may be significant and could negatively impact our business;

•Risk that mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, spin offs and other strategic transactions, including the L3Harris Merger, fail to qualify for the intended tax treatment for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, such as a tax-free reorganization in the case of the L3Harris Merger;

•Risk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions, including non-competition arrangements applicable to certain of our business lines, or within expected timeframes;

•Potential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses merged with or acquired or to be divested; and

•Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations.

The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved from time to time is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation and other legal proceedings, particularly those involving governments. From time to time, we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of arbitration matters. These actions may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of








these or new matters will be favorable to us. Although we maintain insurance policies, these policies may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to current or future claims and may not cover the conduct that is the subject of the litigation or arbitration. Desired levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. In addition, we believe that while we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us, the results of litigation or arbitration can be difficult to predict, including litigation involving jury trials. Accordingly, our current judgment as to the likelihood of our loss (or our current estimate as to the potential range of loss, if applicable) with respect to any particular litigation or arbitration matter may be wrong. A significant judgment or arbitration award against us arising out of any of our current or future litigation or arbitration matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.

We are subject to government investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.

U.S. Government contractors are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, including ITAR and FCPA, and from time to time agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether we have been and are operating in accordance with these requirements. We  may cooperate with the U.S. Government in those investigations. Under U.S. Government regulations, an indictment of L3Harris by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in us being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. A conviction, or an administrative finding against us that satisfies the requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government for a specific term, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.

Our commercial aviation products, systems and services business (a portion of L3’s business prior to the L3Harris Merger) is affected by global demand and economic factors that could negatively impact our financial results.

As a result of the L3Harris Merger, we now have commercial aviation products, systems and services business. The operating results of our commercial aviation products, systems and services business may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production and orders, and global flying hours, which impacts air transport, regional and business aircraft utilization rates and pilot training needs. The aviation industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies and is impacted by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The results of our commercial aviation business also depend on other factors, including general economic growth, political stability in both developed and emerging markets, pricing pressures, trends in capital goods markets and changes in original equipment manufacturer production rates.








We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.

Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:

•The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;

•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

•Increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process R&D and impairment of goodwill or other long-term assets in connection with mergers or acquisitions;

•Changes in available tax credits;

•Changes in share-based compensation expense;

•Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;

•Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and

•The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.

Our level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our unfunded defined benefit plans liability may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.

At the end of fiscal


, Harris had

$3.4 billion

in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt and approximately

$1.2 billion

of unfunded defined benefit plans liability. In addition, we assumed $3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt in connection with the L3Harris Merger and expect our unfunded defined benefit plans liability will increase substantially when we complete our initial accounting for the L3Harris Merger during the Fiscal Transition Period.



In the future we may increase our borrowings; however, our ability to do so will be subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness as well as any future debt that we may incur and our ability to make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due or make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; reducing our cash dividend rate and/or share repurchases; or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense technology industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.








A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.

The credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt securities.

Unforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have significant operations in locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

Our corporate headquarters and significant business operations are located in Florida, which is subject to the risk of major hurricanes. Our worldwide operations and operations of our suppliers could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.

From time to time, we acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, such assumptions and judgment may prove to have been inaccurate and unforeseen issues could arise, which could adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. As of June 28, 2019, we had goodwill of

$5.3 billion

recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and we expect the amount of recorded goodwill and other intangible assets will increase substantially when we complete our initial accounting for the L3Harris Merger during the Fiscal Transition Period. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually, as well as when we change reporting units and when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. Because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on accounting








policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report andNote 1: Significant Accounting PoliciesandNote 9: Goodwillin the Notes.

We must attract and retain key employees, and any failure to do so could seriously harm us.

Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel, including employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly clearances of top-secret and above. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would damage our future prospects.

Some of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.

At the end of fiscal 2019, approximately630of Harris’ U.S. employees were unionized, which represented approximately3 percentof Harris’ employee-base.Following the L3Harris Merger, we now have more employees working under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and worker representatives. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor collective bargaining agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture products or provide services on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Risks Relating to Integration Following the L3Harris Merger

We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the businesses.

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the businesses. The combination of independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integration activities. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full benefits anticipated. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, the overall integration may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:

•the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;

•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;

•difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;

•conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the companies;

•difficulties in the assimilation of employees;

•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;

•difficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, systems, procedures and policies for the combined company;

•challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;

•challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and

•coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the L3Harris Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected benefits of the L3Harris Merger and negatively impact the price of our stock. As a result, we can give no assurances that the L3Harris Merger will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated.








Certain business uncertainties arising from the L3Harris Merger could adversely affect our businesses and operations.

Uncertainties about the effect of the L3Harris Merger on employees, customers, suppliers, business partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may have an adverse effect on us. During times of significant change and uncertainty such as the period following the L3Harris Merger, customers, suppliers, business partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer business decisions, decide to terminate, modify or renegotiate their relationships with us, or take other actions as a result of the L3Harris Merger that could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our securities. Our ability to raise additional capital through the debt markets, and the associated borrowing costs, may also be negatively impacted. Any such effects could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger. These uncertainties about the effect of the L3Harris Merger may also impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be challenging, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or may be dissatisfied with their new roles. If key employees depart, our business could be materially harmed. If key employees join a competitor or form a new competitor, existing and potential clients could choose to use the products or services of that competitor instead of our products or services.

We have incurred and will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the L3Harris Merger.

We have incurred substantial expenses in connection with completing the L3Harris Merger and expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating and integrating the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of the combined companies. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and coordination expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and coordination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by us. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
