Item 1A.Risk Factors

Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements

The following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with Teledyne. These factors could materially affect “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that we may make from time to time, including forward-looking statements contained in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K and in Teledyne’s2013Annual Report to Stockholders. It is not possible for management to predict all such factors, and new factors may emerge.  Additionally, management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on Teledyne or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.



A new global recession, continued economic uncertainty in Europe or an economic downturn in China may adversely affect us.

If another global recession emerges, if economic uncertainty in Europe continues or worsens, or if economic growth in China substantially slows, we may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays, collection difficulties, increased price pressures for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers.   If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent, orders for our products may decrease, which would result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent, they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. These events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue, increased price competition, and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets, domestic and international commercial aerospace markets, the semiconductor industry, the consumer electronics and automotive industries, each of which has been cyclical and suffered from fluctuating market demands. A cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results.

In addition, we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity. Adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services, which may reduce our revenues, profits or production levels. Some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining, which may be negatively impacted by reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity.



United States and global responses to terrorism, the winding down of war in Afghanistan, continuing turmoil in Middle Eastern countries, concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy, potential epidemics, financial issues facing airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

United States’ and global responses to terrorism, the winding down of war in Afghanistan, continuing turmoil in Middle Eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations.

Air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts, as well as after the H1N1 virus, SARS and bird flu scares.  While travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors, additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and, in turn, could adversely affect our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. In addition, a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities, disruptions in our supply chain, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our businesses. Moreover, health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities.

Deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and in-flight communications equipment, which would adversely affect our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment.

Higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airline-related customers of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. Conversely, lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and hinder our











marine and other instrumentation businesses. In addition, instability in the Middle East or other oil-producing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses.

Acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our growth strategy includes acquisitions. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as:

•our ability to assess accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, internal controls, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;

•the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;

•our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial, operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;

•our ability to assess, integrate and implement internal controls of acquired businesses in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

•the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses;

•increased competition for acquisition targets, which may increase acquisition costs;

•the potential impairment of assets;

•potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest;

•the risks associated with acquiring privately-held companies, which generally do not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies;

•production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations;

•risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations; and

•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business.



While we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. Further, indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters, particularly matters identified after a closing.

As they have over the last few years, acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by Teledyne.  For example, the DALSA acquisition in 2011 and the LeCroy acquisition in 2012 increased the percentage of sales attributable to commercial customers as opposed to the U.S. Government.  These acquisitions, coupled with our acquisitions of additional Canada-based companies (Optech and VariSystems) and U.K.-based PDM-Neptec in 2012 and also our 2013 acquisitions of Denmark-based RESON, U.K.-based CDL and Netherlands-based Axiom, also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to U.S. and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations.  Additionally, both DALSA’s and LeCroy’s businesses have been more capital intensive than other Teledyne businesses, increasing Teledyne’s capital requirements.

Under SEC rules, Teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The SEC permits a limited time-based exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls. Our 2013 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2013 acquisitions of RESON, Axiom, CETAC and CDL, allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate. With regard to future acquisitions, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions.

In connection with our acquisitions, including ones which we do not complete, we may incur significant transaction costs. We are required to expense, as incurred, such transaction costs, which may have an adverse impact on our quarterly financial results.

We are subject to the risks associated with international sales, which could harm our business or results of operations.

During2013, sales to international customers accounted for approximately44%of our total revenues, compared with39%in2012and36%in2011. In 2013, we sold products to customers in over 100 countries.  The2013top five countries for international sales were theUnited Kingdom,Norway,China,GermanyandSouth Korea, constituting23%of our total sales.  Our acquisitions, including RESON in 2013, LeCroy in 2012 and DALSA in 2011, contributed to greater international sales.  We anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues, particularly since business and growth plans for many Teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the United States, including to emerging markets such as China, Brazil and West Africa.











Risks associated with international sales include:

•political and economic instability;

•international terrorism;

•export controls, including U.S. export controls related to China and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments, digital imaging and other products;

•changes in legal and regulatory requirements;

•U.S. and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products;

•changes in tax laws and tariffs;

•changes in U.S. - China relations;

•difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;

•transportation, including piracy in international waters; and

•exchange rate fluctuations.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position. With the 2011 acquisition of Canada-based DALSA and the 2012 acquisitions of the majority interest in the parent company of Optech, also Canada-based, volatility in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our Digital Imaging segment.

Sales of our products and services internationally are subject to U.S. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import-export control. Violations of export control rules could result in the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation. Depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts.

Among other things, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment.  Further, in 2011, the United Kingdom also implemented the U.K. Bribery Act, which raised the bar for anti-bribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the FCPA. Any determination that we had violated the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, or equivalent anti-bribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  While we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct FCPA and other trainings, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees, agents or business partners.

An increasingly material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.

An increasingly material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production industry.  Our largest commercial customer is in this industry and accounted for 3.6%, 3.4% and 2.9% of total sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   The offshore oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. Oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. Worldwide political, economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our Instrumentation  segment.  Some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following:

•worldwide demand for oil and gas;

•general economic and business conditions and industry trends;

•the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels;

•the level of production by non-OPEC countries;

•the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures;

•domestic and foreign tax policy;

•laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;

•technological changes;

•the political environment of oil-producing regions; and

•the price and availability of alternative fuels.











Our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks:

Our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the U.S. Government, and, accordingly, we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed.

We perform work on a number of contracts with the Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. Sales under contracts with the U.S. Government as a whole, including sales under contracts with the Department of Defense, as prime contractor or subcontractor, represented approximately27%of our total revenue in2013, compared with32%in2012and36%in2011. Performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations and the failure of Congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations. The U.S. Government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses, and the failure by Congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our services and products and cause us to lose future revenues.  Additionally, defense spending is expected to continue to decline in some areas over the next few years.  A continued emphasis on Federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending.  The continued war on terrorism and the winding down of the war in Afghanistan also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which Teledyne participates.  Budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors, and smaller defense budgets could result in government in-sourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not in-sourced, which could result in lower revenues and profits.

The sequestration provision of the Budget Control Act of 2011 originally imposed $500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013, which represented approximately 9% of planned defense funding over the period.  While the recent two-year budget agreement set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 lessened the across-the-board cuts of sequestration, sequestration continues to be in effect, including for the U.S. Department of Defense.  The two-year budget agreement reduced the $52 billion that the U.S. Department of Defense was supposed to lose in 2014 by $21 billion, which translates to a 1.2% reduction compared to 2013, as compared to the originally set 6% reduction.  Cuts for 2015 were reduced by $10 billion.  Sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate as well, including the Missile Defense Agency’s Objective Simulation Framework program, and we expect our defense programs to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts.

Our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time.

The U.S. Government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages. In some cases, prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like Teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids. As a result, our Engineered Systems segment could be significantly impacted.

Over time, and for a variety of reasons, programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation. For example, Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc.’s Ground-based Midcourse Defense program was negatively impacted by both the nominal end date of development activity and the change in focus of the current Administration relative to missile defense.











We have been a significant participant in NASA programs, primarily through our Engineered Systems segment and through Teledyne Scientific Company. The current Administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy, including the cancellation of the NASA’s Constellation Program which includes Ares launch vehicles. The Administration plans to utilize commercial launch vehicles for crew and cargo ISS expeditions, and develop a NASA heavy lift launch vehicle for space exploration.  As a result of these changes, we have been attempting to transition our business to meet the needs of the new policy and programs, with the further understanding that the existing ISS will continue to be fully functional and supported and that the U.S. will continue investment in human space flight.  While most recently, in early 2014, we were awarded a five-year $60 million contract by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center to develop and manufacture the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter for the Space Launch System, failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales. In addition, delayed funding and changes in support for NASA’s current space policy could negatively impact our business.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us.

Most of our U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination. Termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in re-procuring undelivered items from another source. We hadfourU.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience in2013, compared withsixin2012andsevenin2011.  No contracts were terminated for default during such three-year period.

We may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixed-price government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain pre-specified targets in government contracts.

There is no guarantee that U.S. Government contracts will be profitable. A number of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed-price type contracts (60%of our total U.S. Government contracts were fixed-price in2013,59%in2012and60%in2011). Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. Under such contracts, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts. We cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses. We may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates.

Our business is subject to government contracting regulations and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects.

We, like other government contractors, are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations (including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits) relating to our compliance with federal and state laws. More routinely, the U.S. Government may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. Government contracts, including allocated indirect costs.  Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs.  Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded.  We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit.  In a worst case scenario, should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing, or should the U.S. Government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor”, that business or division, and conceivably our Company as a whole, could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of a conviction, could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts.  In addition, we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages, fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements.

Our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness, could materially and adversely affect our business.

As ofDecember 29, 2013, we had$540.2 millionin total outstanding indebtedness. This indebtedness included$250.0 millionin senior unsecured notes,$200.0 millionin term loans,$74.2 millionunder our$750.0 million2013-amended credit facility and$16.0 millionin other debt. Our indebtedness could harm our business by, among other things, reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions.  Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. Our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business. General adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner.  We may elect to raise other forms of debt capital, depending on financial, market and economic conditions.











Product liability claims, product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage.

As a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products, including monitoring instruments, products used in offshore oil and gas production, products used in commercial aviation and products used in medical devices (most recently including X-ray detectors), our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products. In part, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product, which could adversely affect our results of operations. This could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts.

While we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities, we have self-insured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities. Awarded damages could be more than our accruals. We could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well. We cannot assure that, for 2014 and in future years, insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability.

Product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products.

We have been joined, among a number of defendants (often over 100), in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. In addition, because of the prominent “Teledyne” name, we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spin-off. To date, we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits. However, our historic insurance coverage, including that of its predecessors, may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters. Coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors. Nonetheless, we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims.

Certain gas generators historically manufactured by Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. contained a sealed, wetted asbestos component. While the company has transitioned to a replacement material, had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees, there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers compensation claims involving this component.

Our Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc.’s laboratory in Knoxville, Tennessee performs radiological analyses. Errors and omissions in analyses may occur. Our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses.

Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. and other Teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market, including utilities and certain governmental entities. Certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the Price Anderson Act and other statutory and common law defenses, and we have received indemnities from some of our customers. However, there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection.

We cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products.

Our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the stock market, interest rates and actuarial experience.

We have a defined benefit qualified pension plan covering most of our U.S. employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately 20% of our active employees. The value of the combined pension assets is currently greater than our pension benefit obligation. The accounting rules applicable to our qualified pension plan require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. Two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations. Declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan and/or result in a change to shareholders’ equity. Our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit, financial or stock markets deteriorate. Any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations.  In 2012, in an effort to reduce the risks associated with our current and future domestic pension obligation, we amended the pension plan to change the rate at which pension benefits accrue after February 29, 2012 and offered and made lump sum payments to certain participants in the plan whose employment with Teledyne had terminated.  In


,


and


, we have made aggregate voluntary pretax cash contributions of $244.8 million to the domestic pension plan.  If, and to the extent, decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions, recovered through future asset returns, mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted, or other actions, our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans. For additional discussion of pension matters, see the discussion under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Notes 2 and 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.











Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.

We may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions.

We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in new markets.

We intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments. We may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements, as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors.

Limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas.

We may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could harm our growth and prospects.

Our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. In order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now Teledyne Scientific Company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased DALSA, which has access to a well-equipped MEMS research and development center.  In 2013, we opened a 52,000-square-foot technology development center in Daytona Beach, Florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries.  Deepwater and harsh environments demand new materials and technology from our Teledyne Oil & Gas businesses to support high temperature, high pressure locations.  Successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our











competitors, and market acceptance. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements.

Our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes. We may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner.

Additionally, new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage. Accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed.

Technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or non-competitive.

The markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements. A faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services, or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology, could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change, which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services.

We may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates, which could harm our sales or margins.

More and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products. While we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products, without affecting product quality and reliability, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers. Cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market, credit and economic conditions. Customers may seek lower cost products from China and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower.

The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.

Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. If any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services.

Each of our markets is highly competitive.  Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do. New or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. Industry acquisition and consolidation trends, particularly among aerospace and defense contractors, have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors in-source increased amounts of major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet Government contracting goals. Low-cost competition from China and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products. Increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge, which would negatively impact our revenues. Smaller defense budgets both in the United States and Europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs.











We sell products to customers in industries that may again undergo rapid and unpredictable changes, which could adversely affect our operational results or production levels.

We develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past, including the semiconductor and the telecommunications industries. In 2009, DALSA experienced a significant decline in demand for its products for the semiconductor and electronics inspection industries. These industries, or others that we serve, may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results, or our production levels, or both.

Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers.

Some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.

While no commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales during2013,2012and2011and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve, certain product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.  Teledyne’s largest commercial customer, a customer of our Instrumentation segment, accounted for3.6%,3.4%and2.9%of total sales in2013,2012and2011, respectively.

Newer products, such as our X-ray panel products, may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms.  Similarly, some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers.  In either such case, program delays of such customer or customers, as well as the loss of such customer or customers, could adversely affect our business or financial results.

We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.

We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers and OEMs (collectively “distributors”).  Using third parties for distribution exposes Teledyne to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk and compliance risks.  We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue.  Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results.  Violations of the FCPA or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business.  Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, and could result in sanctions against us.

Compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations, as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities, could have a material adverse financial effect on us.

We, like other industry participants, are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations. We may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some product lines of our Instrumentation segment.













Our manufacturing operations could expose us to material environmental liabilities and companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.  In 2013, we established an environmental reserve of $5.3 million related to potential soil remediation activities at a former leased facility.

For additional discussion of environmental matters, see the discussion under the caption “Other Matters - Environmental” of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition” and Note 15 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has focused on greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), maintaining GHGs threaten the public health and welfare of the American people. The EPA also maintains that GHG emissions from on-road vehicles contribute to that threat. The EPA’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases. The EPA’s continuing efforts to limit GHG emissions could adversely affect our U.S. manufacturing operations, increase prices for energy, fuel and transportation, require us to accommodate changes in parameters, such as the way parts are manufactured, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign of certain products. This could lead to increased costs, which we may not be able to recover from customers, delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors.

Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.

Our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We also have a maturing work force. While we have engaged in succession planning, the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to sell, exit or reconfigure businesses that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy.

Consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets, we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.  This review led to the decision to sell our general aviation piston engine businesses, which sale was completed in April 2011.  As a result of our review and declines in our electronic manufacturing services businesses, in 2013, we closed our Teledyne Microelectronics Technologies’ facility in Marina del Rey, California and relocated several of its product lines to other Teledyne locations.  In further response to downturns in our defense businesses, in 2013, we also began consolidating some of our microelectronic component operations into our Mountain View, California facility and also our Shipley, England facility, and relatedly sold a former manufacturing site in Sunnyvale, California.  Additionally, we closed Teledyne CML Group Limited’s precision machining and fabrications business in Birkenhead, England to focus more on its advanced composites manufacturing business.  For 2014, we are planning to consolidate certain instrumentation operations and complete the consolidation of some microelectronic component product lines.

Our ability to dispose of, exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of product lines or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.

Our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.

We are implementing an enterprise resource planning software system, which is intended to improve our business processes in certain business units. The costs associated with such systems are significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs. Any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal controls over financial reporting.  As we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project, we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure. Although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated. Further, we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project.











Natural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The environmental disaster triggered by the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our Teledyne oil and gas businesses, although such adverse impact was offset, in part, by the products we manufacture that supported well-capping and environmental clean-up efforts.  Environmental regulations enacted in the wake of this oil spill have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our Teledyne oil and gas businesses. Similar future man-made disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business. For example, in 2011 the earthquake in northern Japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in Thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas.

Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. is building an imaging platform to be affixed to the ISS.  For the program to be financially successful, the 15 year-old ISS must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition.   While certain spaceflight risks, such as a high velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the ISS, have been regarded as small, if such event were to occur, the ISS program continuation could be threatened, jeopardizing  our investment and potential revenue generation from ISS-based Earth imaging.

We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights, each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business.

Our ability to enforce and protect our patents, copyrights, software licenses, trade secrets, know how, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we have found that various claims may be asserted against us, including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim.  In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties.  If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.











Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches.

Increases in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.

Our effective tax rate for2013was 17.7%, compared with28.7%for2012and32.9%for2011.  Fiscal years2013,2012and2011included net discrete tax benefits of $21.3 million,$5.4 millionand$2.4 million, respectively.  Excluding these items, Teledyne’s effective tax rates for2013,2012and2011would have been 27.1%,31.0%and34.0%, respectively.  While there continues to be Congressional discussion about lowering the corporate tax rate in the U.S. to improve global competitiveness, a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:



•the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions;

•changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the U.S. to the taxation of foreign income and expenses, changes in tax laws in foreign jurisdictions, and changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and governing body pronouncements and interpretations;

•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;

•changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred tax valuation allowances;

•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;

•increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes;

•changes in available tax credits; and

•any decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.

Our financial statements are based on estimates required by GAAP, and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions.

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. For example, estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations, allowances for doubtful accounts, allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, depreciation and amortization, impairment assessments, employee benefits, taxes, recall and warranty costs, product and general liability and contingencies. While we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, actual results may differ materially from those estimated.  Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in this Form 10-K and in Teledyne’s 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders, under "Critical Accounting Estimates."

While we believe our internal control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns











can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

Provisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our Change in Control Severance Agreements could make an acquisition of Teledyne more difficult.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of Teledyne, in a transaction not approved by our board of directors, more difficult. We have also entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with 16 members of our current management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company.

The market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company, and could continue to do so.

Since we became an independent public company on November 29, 1999, the market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•quarterly variations in our operating results;

•strategic actions by us or our competitors;

•acquisitions;

•divestitures;

•stock repurchases;

•adverse business developments;

•war in the Middle East or elsewhere;

•terrorists activities;

•military or homeland defense activities;

•changes to the U.S. Federal budget;

•changes in the energy exploration or production, semiconductor, digital imaging, telecommunications, commercial aviation, and electronic manufacturing services markets;

•general market conditions;

•changes in tax laws;

•general economic factors unrelated to our performance;

•changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues, earnings or other financial results; and

•one or more of the risk factors described in this report.

The stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology companies in particular, have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies. We cannot provide assurances as to our stock price.
