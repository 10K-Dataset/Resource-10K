Item 1A.Risk Factors

Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements

The following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with Teledyne.  These factors could materially affect “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that we may make from time to time, including forward-looking statements contained in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K and in Teledyne’s2018Annual Report to Stockholders.  It is not possible for management to predict all such factors, and new factors may emerge or existing factors diverge.  Additionally, management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on Teledyne or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.



A new global recession or an economic downturn in China may adversely affect us.

We develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets, domestic and international commercial aerospace markets, the semiconductor industry, the consumer electronics, telecommunications and









automotive industries, each of which has been cyclical, exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands. A cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results.

In addition, we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity.  Adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services, which may reduce our revenues, profits or production levels.  Some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining, which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity.



Escalating trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us.

The U.S. Government has recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum products and materials imported into the United States. The U.S. Government has also implemented or announced plans to impose tariffs on a wide-range of goods imported from China. Various countries and economic regions have announced plans or intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide-range of products they import from the U.S. These newly imposed or threatened U.S. tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have the effect of increasing the cost of materials for our products, which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins.  Sales to customers in China are particularly important for businesses in our Environmental and Electronic Measurement Instrumentation group.  The tariffs could also result in disruptions to our supply chain, as suppliers struggle to fill orders from companies trying to purchase goods in bulk ahead of announced tariffs. We may also need to find new suppliers and components for our products, which could result in production delays. To the extent our products are  the subject of retaliatory tariffs, customers in some countries or regions, such as China, may begin to seek domestic or non-U.S. sources for products that we sell, or be pressured or incentivized by foreign governments not to purchase U.S.-origin goods, which could harm our future sales in these markets.

A material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry, especially the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.

A material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration, development and production, especially the offshore oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities.  Oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities.  Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our Instrumentation  segment.

Some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following:

•worldwide demand for oil and gas;

•general economic and business conditions and industry trends;

•the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels;

•the level of production by non-OPEC countries;

•the ability of oil and gas companies to generate or raise funds for capital expenditures;

•domestic and foreign tax policy;

•laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;

•laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing;

•technological changes;

•the political environment of oil-producing regions;

•the price and availability of alternative fuels; and

•climate change regulation that provide incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources.



Teledyne manufactures seismic sources, interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration.  When crude oil and natural gas prices are low, the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases, potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration.  In addition, a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves, which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production, and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders and a reduction in customer-funded research and development related to next generation products.









Our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness, could materially and adversely affect our business.

As ofDecember 30, 2018, we had$748.8 millionin total outstanding indebtedness.  This indebtedness included$325.0 millionin senior unsecured fixed rate notes,$286.0 millionin Euro denominated fixed rate notes,$100.0 millionin term loans and$29.0 millionoutstanding under our$750.0 millionfloating rate credit facility.  Our indebtedness could harm our business by, among other things, reducing the funds available to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions.  Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.  Our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business. General adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner.

Further, in July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in debt instruments, derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.  ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives, debt and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. It is unclear as to the new method of calculating LIBOR that may evolve and this new method could adversely affect the Company’s interest rates on its indebtedness. The Company is monitoring the ARRC transition plan and is evaluating potential related risks.  As of December 30, 2018 approximately four percent of the Company’s long-term debt is variable and can be indexed to USD-LIBOR. The Company expects to amend the $750.0 million credit facility in the first quarter of 2019 in order to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to March 2024. In anticipation of the expected elimination of LIBOR in 2021, this credit facility amendment will include the procedure to switch to LIBOR alternative replacement rates in the future.

We are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations, which could harm our business or results of operations.

During2018, sales to international customers accounted for approximately47%of our total revenues, compared with46%in2017and43%in2016.  In2018, we sold products to customers in over 100 countries.  In2018, the top five countries for international sales wereChina,Germany,the United Kingdom,JapanandSouth Korea, constituting approximately21%of our total sales.  We anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues, particularly since business and growth plans for many Teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the United States, including to emerging markets such as China, Brazil and West Africa.

Risks associated with international sales include, but are not limited to:

•political and economic instability;

•international terrorism;

•export controls, including U.S. export controls related to China, sanctions related to Russia, and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments, digital imaging and other products;

•failure to comply with anti-bribery legislation, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•changes in legal and regulatory requirements;

•U.S. and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products;

•changes in tax laws and tariffs;

•changes in U.S. - China and U.S. - Russia relations;

•difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;

•failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union;

•transportation, including piracy in international waters; and

•exchange rate fluctuations.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. is currently scheduled to leave the E.U. on May 29, 2019, unless this date is extended. To date there has been no agreement between the E.U. and the U.K. on the terms of the exit.  The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business.  The announcement of Brexit, and subsequent high-profile failures of the U.K. to agree on an exit strategy, and the pending withdrawal of the U.K.









from the E.U. may also create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. countries and other nations, may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services, and may cause certain E.U.-based customers to source products from businesses based outside of the U.K.  For example, Brexit-related uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by Airbus as to future investment and spending in the U.K., which could reduce sales for our U.K.-based businesses that supply Airbus.  Potential Brexit-related risks for our U.K.-based businesses also include increased import duties, loss of customers in the E.U., delays in the movement of goods between the U.K. and the E.U. and loss of access to the E.U. labor pool.  Given our several U.K.-based businesses, volatility in the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our U.K.-based businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our U.K.-based businesses.

Acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our growth strategy includes acquisitions. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as:

•our ability to assess accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, internal controls, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;

•the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;

•our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial, operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;

•our ability to assess, integrate and implement internal controls of acquired businesses in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

•the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses;

•increased competition for acquisition targets, which may increase acquisition costs;

•the potential impairment of assets;

•potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest, including environmental liabilities;

•the risks associated with acquiring privately-held companies, which generally do not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies;

•production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations;

•risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations; and

•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business.

While we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.  Further, indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters, particularly matters identified after a closing.

In connection with our acquisitions, including ones which we do not complete, we may incur significant transaction costs. We are required to expense, as incurred, such transaction costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to become impaired, resulting in significant losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.

On

December 30, 2018

, Teledyne’s goodwill was

$1,735.2 million

and net acquired intangible assets were

$344.3 million









the period in which the charge is taken.  We also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if, as a result of a change in strategy or other reason, we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired.

United States and global responses to terrorism, concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy, continuing turmoil in Middle Eastern countries, increasing tension between the U.S. and Russia and China, potential epidemics, potential future financial issues impacting airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

United States’ and global responses to terrorism, continuing turmoil in Middle Eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations.  Increasing tensions with Russia, as well as China, could disrupt the global economic recovery.

Air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts, as well as after the high-profile outbreaks of disease.  Additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and, in turn, could adversely affect our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment.  In addition, a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities, disruptions in our supply chain, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our businesses.  Moreover, health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities.

Higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airline-related customers of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment.  Conversely, lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses.  In addition, instability in the Middle East or other oil-producing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses.

Our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks:

Our revenue from U.S. government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the U.S. Government, and, accordingly, we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed.

We perform work on a number of contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors.  Sales under contracts with the U.S. Government as a whole, including sales under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, as prime contractor or subcontractor, represented approximately23%of our total revenue in2018, compared with24%in2017and27%in2016.  Performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations and the failure of Congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations.  The partial U.S. Government shutdown that began in December 2018 resulted in delays in anticipated contract awards and delayed payments of invoices for several of our businesses.  The U.S. Government shutdown in 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses, as did prior shutdowns of the U.S. Government and any new shutdown could have similar or worse effects.  The failure by Congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues.  Any renewed emphasis on Federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending.  Budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors, and smaller defense budgets could result in government in-sourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not in-sourced, which could result in lower revenues and profits.









in funded programs and the timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues.  Finally, various U.S. Department of Defense initiatives, such as the emphasis on in-sourcing positions to the Government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs, could negatively impact our Engineered Systems segment.

Our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time.

The U.S. Government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages.  In some cases, prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like Teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids.  As a result, our Engineered Systems segment could be significantly impacted.

Over time, and for a variety of reasons, programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation.  We have been a significant participant in NASA programs, primarily through our Engineered Systems segment and through Teledyne Scientific Company. The prior U.S. Presidential Administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy, including the cancellation of the NASA’s Constellation Program which includes Ares launch vehicles.  Delayed funding and changes in support for NASA’s current space policy could negatively impact our business.  The Presidential Administration could also lead to changes to the nation’s space policy, some or all of which could materially impact our results.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us.

Most of our U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor.  Termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination.  Termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in re-procuring undelivered items from another source.  We had 15 U.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience in2018, compared withninein2017andonein2016.  No contracts were terminated for default during such three-year period.

We may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixed-price and other government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain pre-specified targets in government contracts.

There is no guarantee that U.S. Government contracts will be profitable.  A number of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed-price type contracts (67%of our total U.S. Government contracts were fixed-price in2018,58%in2017and54%in2016).  Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price.  Under such contracts, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts.  We cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses.  We may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates.  We may also lose money on non-fixed price, cost-reimbursement contracts that contain dis-incentives or penalties related to cost, schedule or performance.

Our business is subject to government contracting regulations, including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects.















Our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the stock market, interest rates and actuarial experience.

We have a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of our U.S. employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately

12%

$83.0 million

to the domestic qualified pension plan.  No contributions were made to the domestic qualified pension plan since the 2013 contribution.  If, and to the extent, decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions, recovered through future asset returns, mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted, or other actions, our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans.  In addition, we have sold approximately $63.9 million in pension liability to third parties in recent years.  To the extent any of these counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to retirees, we may have residual liability, particularly to the extent state guarantee funds are inadequate.  For additional discussion of pension matters, see the discussion under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Notes 2 and 11 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches.

We may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions.

In order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities.  Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields.  Our Teledyne Scientific Company subsidiary, which serves as our primary research center, has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other Teledyne businesses, including our Teledyne Oil & Gas, Teledyne Defense Electronics and Teledyne Digital Imaging and Test and Measurement businesses.  The business of e2v, for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral, also requires substantial investments in research and development.  Additionally, some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives,









including DALSA with respect to its CMOS and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts as well as the expansion of DALSA’s semiconductor foundry in Bromont, Quebec.  Nonetheless, we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions.  Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including the existence of bank and capital markets, investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions.  Failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability.

Limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas.

We may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or increase our participation in new markets, which could harm our profitability and prospects.

Our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis.  In order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now Teledyne Scientific Company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased DALSA, which has access to a well-equipped MEMS research and development center.  In 2013, we opened a 52,000-square-foot technology development center in Daytona Beach, Florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries.  We are currently upgrading infrastructure at Teledyne e2v’s facility in Chelmsford, U.K. and are expanding Teledyne DALSA’s MEMS foundry in Bromont, Quebec.  Successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors, and market acceptance.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements.

Our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes.  We may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner.

Additionally, new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage.  Accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed.

We intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments.  We may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements, as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors.

Technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or non-competitive.

We may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates, which could harm our sales or margins.

More and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products.  While we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products, without affecting product quality and reliability, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers.  Cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions. Customers may seek lower cost products from China and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower.









The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.

Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  If any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations.  If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Recent trends by China’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed, and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize, which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses.

Increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services.

Product liability claims, product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage.

As a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products, including monitoring instruments, products used in offshore oil and gas production, products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices (most recently including X-ray detectors and generators), our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products.  In part, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  This could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts.

While we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities and errors and omissions, we have self-insured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities.  Awarded damages could be more than our accruals.  We could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well.  We cannot assure that, for 2019 and in future years, insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability.

Product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products.  We cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products.

We have been joined, among a number of defendants (often over 100), in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos.  In addition, because of the prominent “Teledyne” name, we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spin-off.  To date, we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits.  However, our historic insurance coverage, including that of its predecessors, may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters.  Coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors.  Nonetheless, we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims.

Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. and other Teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market, including utilities and certain governmental entities.  Certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act and other statutory and common law defenses, and we have









received indemnities from some of our customers.  However, there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection.

Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers.

We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.

We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers and OEMs (collectively “distributors”).  Using third parties for distribution exposes Teledyne to many risks, including concentration, credit risk and compliance risks.  We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue.  Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results.  Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business.  Competitors could also block our access to key distributors.  Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, and could result in sanctions against us.

Compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations, as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities, could have a material adverse financial effect on us.

We, like other industry participants, are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations.  We may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase.  Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our Instrumentation segment.

Our manufacturing operations, including former operations, could expose us to material environmental liabilities.  Additionally, companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has focused on greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), maintaining GHGs threaten the public health and welfare of the American people.  The EPA also maintains that GHG emissions from on-road vehicles contribute to that threat.  The EPA’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases. The EPA’s continuing efforts to limit GHG emissions could adversely affect our U.S. manufacturing operations, increase prices for energy, fuel and transportation, require us to accommodate changes in parameters, such as the way parts are manufactured, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign certain of our products.  This, or other federal or state regulations, could lead to increased costs, which we may not be able to recover from customers, delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors.

For additional discussion of environmental matters, see the discussion under the caption “Other Matters - Environmental” of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition” and Note 14 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.









Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.

Our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.  We also have a maturing workforce.  Some of our businesses, including those in traveling wave tube design and development, draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking.  While we have engaged in succession planning, the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Low unemployment in the United States has made it more difficult for some of our businesses to attract and retain direct labor in certain markets.

We may not be able to sell, exit or reconfigure businesses, facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated.

Consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets, we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.  Over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities, including to deal with downturns in the defense and oil and gas industries, among other reasons.   We may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities.  There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful.  If we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities, or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.  Our ability to dispose of, exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.  In addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of product lines or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.

Natural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business.  For example, in 2018, a fire at a Netherlands-based facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry, including to businesses in our Digital Imaging segment.

Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. has developed, built, and launched a multi user system for earth sensing that is affixed to the ISS.  For the program to be financially successful, the 19 year-old ISS must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition.  While certain spaceflight risks, such as a high-velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the ISS, have been regarded as small, if such event were to occur, the ISS program continuation could be threatened, jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from ISS-based Earth imaging.









We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights, each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business.

Our ability to enforce and protect our patents, copyrights, software licenses, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries.  When we seek to enforce our rights, we have found that various claims may be asserted against us, including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim.  In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties.  If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations.  Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.

Higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow.

Our effective tax rate for2018was15.3%, compared with20.8%for2017and20.9%for2016.  While in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) was signed into law, which in general lowers corporate tax rates in the United States, a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments, including:

•the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions;

•changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the United States to the taxation of foreign income and expenses, changes in tax laws in foreign jurisdictions, and changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and governing body pronouncements and interpretations;

•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;

•changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred tax valuation allowances;

•adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;

•increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes;

•changes in available tax credits; and

•any decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.

Our financial statements are based on estimates required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions.

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP.  These principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  For example, estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations, allowances for doubtful accounts, allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, depreciation and amortization, impairment assessments, employee benefits, taxes, recall and warranty costs, product and general liability and contingencies. While we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, actual results may differ materially from those estimated.  Our most critical accounting estimates are described in “Item 7.  Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K under “Critical Accounting Estimates.”

There are inherent limitations in internal control systems, and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.









Provisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our Change in Control Severance Agreements could make an acquisition of Teledyne more difficult.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of Teledyne, in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors, more difficult.  We have also entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with ten members of our current management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company.

The market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company, and could continue to do so.

Since we became an independent public company on November 29, 1999, the market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue.  In 2018, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $175.56 to $247.77.

Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•quarterly variations in our operating results;

•strategic actions by us or our competitors;

•acquisitions;

•divestitures;

•stock repurchases;

•adverse business developments;

•war in the Middle East or elsewhere;

•terrorists activities;

•military or homeland defense activities;

•changes to the U.S. Federal budget;

•changes in the energy exploration or production, semiconductor, digital imaging, telecommunications, commercial aviation, and electronic manufacturing services markets;

•general market conditions;

•changes in tax laws;

•general economic factors unrelated to our performance;

•changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues, earnings or other financial results; and

•one or more of the risk factors described in this report.

The stock markets in general, and the markets for high-technology companies in particular, have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies. We cannot provide assurances as to our stock price.  We have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to board-approved stock repurchase programs.  We cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs, or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs.
