Item 1A.Risk Factors

Many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Overcapacity in the global steel industry could increase the level of steel imports, which may
negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The current global steelmaking
capacity exceeds the current global consumption of steel. According to the Organisation for EconomicCo-operationand Development, global steel production overcapacity was approximately 600 million tons
at the end of 2017, with nearly half that amount located in China. Overcapacity is down from its peak in 2015 and 2016. Efforts by China to close inefficient steel production and improve air quality, steel mill closures in Europe and stronger global
economic growth all contributed to reduce excess capacity.

During periods of global economic weakness, this overcapacity is
amplified because of weaker global demand. This excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting significant amounts of steel and steel products at prices that are at or below their costs of production. In some countries
the steel industry is subsidized or owned in whole or in part by the government, giving imported steel from those countries certain cost advantages. These imports, which are also affected by demand in the domestic market, international currency
conversion rates, and domestic and international government actions, can result in downward pressure on steel prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Section 232 steel tariffs are keeping dumped steel products out of the U.S. market. International efforts to reduce global steel
production overcapacity, such as theG-20Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, are







ongoing. The U.S. government is also negotiating new or renegotiating existing trade agreements, which provide another opportunity to address excess steelmaking capacity. Should these efforts
fail to reduce excess capacity and the Section 232 tariffs be lifted, U.S. steelmakers would be at risk of having to compete again against steel products dumped in the U.S. market.

Our industry is cyclical and both recessions and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our business.

Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. Our business supports cyclical
industries such as the commercial construction, energy, metals service centers, appliance and automotive industries. As a result, downturns in the U.S. economy or any of these industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows. General economic conditions in the United States and steel demand in this country are currently stronger than in many parts of the world, but challenges from global overcapacity in the steel industry and ongoing
uncertainties in other regions of the world remain.

While we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry
remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions. Future economic downturns or a prolonged slow-growth or stagnant economy could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows.

Competition from other steel producers, imports or alternative materials may adversely affect our business.

We face strong competition from other steel producers and imports that compete with our products on price and service. The
steel markets are highly competitive and a number of firms, domestic and foreign, participate in the steel and raw materials markets. Depending on a variety of factors, including raw materials cost and availability, energy, technology, labor and
capital costs, government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers, our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces.

In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as concrete, aluminum, plastics, composites and wood. Increased use of
these materials in substitution for steel products could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our steel products.

Since 2011, automobile producers have begun taking steps towards complying with new Corporate Average Fuel Economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce. As automobile
producers work to produce vehicles in compliance with these new standards, they may reduce the amount of steel or begin utilizing alternative materials in cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, thereby reducing demand for steel in North
America. Certain automakers have begun to use greater amounts of aluminum and smaller proportions of steel in some models since 2015.

The
results of our operations are sensitive to volatility in steel prices and the cost of raw materials, particularly scrap steel.

We rely to an extent on outside vendors to supply us with key consumables such as graphite electrodes and raw materials, including both scrap and scrap substitutes that are critical to the manufacture of
our steel products. The raw material required to produce DRI is pelletized iron ore. Although we have vertically integrated our business by constructing our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana and also acquiring DJJ, we still must purchase most
of our primary raw material, steel scrap, from numerous other sources located throughout the United States. Although we believe that the supply of scrap and scrap substitutes is adequate to operate our facilities, prices of these critical raw
materials are volatile and are influenced by changes in scrap exports in response to changes in the scrap, scrap substitutes and iron ore demands of our global competitors. At any given







time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials with price and other terms acceptable to us. The availability and prices of raw materials may also be
negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. Many
countries that export steel into our markets restrict the export of scrap, protecting the supply chain of some foreign competitors. This trade practice creates an artificial competitive advantage for foreign producers that could limit our ability to
compete in the U.S. market.

If our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative
sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to our customers and accepted customer orders for our products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover all or
part of the increased cost of the raw materials. Also, if we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. This could cause us to lose
sales, incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation.

Changes in the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas are
subject to volatile market conditions that could adversely affect our business.

Our steel mills are large consumers of
electricity and natural gas. In addition, our DRI facilities are also large consumers of natural gas. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of
electricity and natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by weather, political and economic factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to raise the price of our products to cover
increased energy costs. Disruptions, including physical or information systems related issues that impact the supply of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers. Increases in our energy
costs resulting from regulations that are not equally applicable across the entire global steel market could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our steelmaking processes, our DRI processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers, customers and competitors are energy intensive
and generate carbon dioxide and other GHGs. The regulation of these GHGs through new rulemaking or legislation in an onerous form could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Carbon is an essential raw material in Nucor’s production processes. As a carbon steel producer, Nucor could be
increasingly affected both directly and indirectly if more stringent GHG regulations are further implemented. Because our operations are subject to most of these new GHG regulations, we are already impacted in the permit modification and
reporting processes. Both GHG regulations and recently promulgated National Air Ambient Quality Standards, which are more restrictive than previous standards, make it significantly more difficult to obtain new permits and to modify existing
permits.

These same regulations have indirectly increased the costs to manufacture our products as they have increased and
continue to increase the cost of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. The discovery of new natural gas reserves utilizing the practice of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is mitigating
some of this indirect impact, as some utilities switch fuels to natural gas from coal thereby reducing their emissions significantly. However, because some generating facilities when faced with new regulations are idling facilities instead of
converting to natural gas, the resulting reduction in capacity can and will create further pressure on electrical energy prices. In 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule to replace the promulgated Clean Power Plan that was driving
many utilities to shutter coal fired power plants. However, there is a significant degree of uncertainty with respect to the results of this change in regulatory direction. To the extent that these regulations cause either directly or indirectly an
increase in the cost of energy, they could have an impact on Nucor’s competitive position.







While the federal government appears to be moving to relax burdensome regulations, some
states are moving to enact their own regulations of carbon and other GHG emissions. If such regulations are enacted in states in which Nucor does business, it could negatively affect those operations. Numerous states, including California,
Washington, Oregon and New York, are considering or have passed laws using Environmental Product Declarations (“EPD”) to evaluate environmental impacts of products. The impacts identified by EPDs could impact future state/consumer
purchasing decisions. California has implemented the “Buy Clean California Act” and California is currently requesting EPDs from manufacturers to be used in State of California funded projects. EPDs will be required for certain materials
including some steel products after January 1, 2020. Global Warming Potentials (“GWP”) will be established by January 1, 2021 for applicable product categories and EPDs will be used to determine product compliance to the GWP
limits. Because some foreign steel producers are not subject to these same indirect and direct regulatory burdens and their associated cost increases, our products could be at a further competitive disadvantage. In addition to increased costs
of production, we could also incur costs to defend and resolve legal claims and other litigation related to new air and water quality regulations and the alleged impact of our operations on the environment.

Environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased costs and materially adversely impact our competitive position.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the
environment, and accordingly, we make provision in our financial statements for the estimated costs of compliance. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, resulting in inherent uncertainties in these
estimates. Nucor has implemented the revised EPA rules and definitions around recycling and solid wastes. The new rules require states to create new programs and certification processes for the companies that wish to continue recycling
materials. Increased administrative and operational costs are likely in the United States to handle steel mill recycled materials such as slag, mill scale, iron dusts, lime and air filtration control dusts. To the extent that competitors,
particularly foreign steel producers and manufacturers of competitive products, are not subject to similar regulation and required to incur equivalent costs, our competitive position could be materially adversely impacted. If one of our permits is
revoked or if we were to experience significant delays in obtaining a permit modification or a new permit, this could result in operational delays at one or more of our facilities, causing a negative impact on our results of operations and cash
flows.

We acquire businesses from time to time and we may encounter difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire.

We plan to continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses, enter into joint ventures and make other investments that
strengthen Nucor. Realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or other transactions will depend on our ability to operate these businesses and integrate them with our operations and to cooperate with our strategic partners. Our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to successfully integrate these businesses.

Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses.

The steelmaking business is subject to numerous inherent risks, particularly unplanned events such as explosions, fires, other accidents,
natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, critical equipment failures, acts of terrorism, inclement weather and transportation interruptions. While our insurance coverage could offset losses relating to some of those types of events, our
results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by our insurance.

We are
subject to information technology and cyber security threats which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We utilize various information technology systems to efficiently address business functions ranging from the operation of our production equipment to administrative computation to the storage of data such
as







intellectual property and proprietary business information. Despite efforts to assure secure and uninterrupted operations, threats from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks or system failures
could result in materially adverse operational disruptions or security breaches. These risks could result in disclosure or destruction of key proprietary information and reputational damage that could adversely affect our ability to physically
produce steel, resulting in lost revenues, as well as delays in reporting our financial results. We also could be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach, including to repair or
replace networks and information technology systems, liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.

Our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements.

Our operations are capital intensive. For the five-year period ended December 31, 2018, our total capital expenditures, excluding
acquisitions, were approximately $3.1 billion. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. Although we expect requirements for our business needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service for
financings and any contingencies, will be financed by internally generated funds, short-term commercial paper issuance or from borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, we cannot assure you that this will be the
case. Additional acquisitions or unforeseen events could require financing from additional sources.

Risks associated with operating in
international markets could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

Certain of our
businesses and investments are located outside of the United States, in Europe, Mexico and in emerging markets. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in such markets. These risks include but are not limited to: unfavorable political
or economic factors; local labor and social issues; changes in regulatory requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and complex foreign laws, treaties including tax laws, and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977. These risks could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our reported results of operations and financial
position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.

The accounting treatment of equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.

We periodically test our equity method investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value
is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. The results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry, as well as changes in interest rates and general
economic conditions. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur anon-cashimpairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations.

Tax increases and
changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial results.

The steel industry and our business are
sensitive to changes in taxes. As a company based in the United States, Nucor is more exposed to the effects of changes in U.S. tax laws than some of our major competitors. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be
adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws.







We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal
standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various issues, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual,
import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” A negative
outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs,
the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.13

Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop
strategies to manage them.







Interest Rate Risk– Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a
combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. At December 31, 2018, approximately 24% of Nucor’s long-term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly. The remaining 76% of
Nucor’s long-term debt was at fixed rates. Future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings. Nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. As of
December 31, 2018, there were no such contracts outstanding. Nucor’s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities. As a result, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant
impact on the value of our investment securities recorded as short-term investments.

Commodity Price Risk– In
the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for
our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to
effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana
provide us with flexibility in managing our input costs. DRI is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic production.

Natural gas produced by Nucor’s drilling operations is being sold to third parties to offset our exposure to changes in the price of
natural gas consumed by our Louisiana DRI facility and our steel mills in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the volume of natural gas sold from our drilling operations was approximately 15% of the volume of natural gas
purchased for consumption in our domestic steelmaking and DRI facilities.

Nucor also periodically uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. Gains and losses from derivatives
designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At December 31, 2018,
accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes included $6.5 million in unrealizednet-of-taxlosses for the fair value of these derivative
instruments. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period. The following table presents the negative effect onpre-taxearnings of a
hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at December 31, 2018, due to an assumed 10% and 25% change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands):



Commodity Derivative10% Change25% ChangeNatural gas$11,768$29,420Aluminum4,37010,905Copper7241,770

Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive
loss, net of income taxes, or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. These hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities.

Foreign Currency Risk– Nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and
Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were insignificant



Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to Nucor’s 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, pages 47 through 82.







Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.



Item 9A.Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures –As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting –There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
