Item 1A. Risk Factors.



The following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. See the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements located on page 1 of this Form 10-K.



We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forward-looking statements including those made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public.



Except as may be required under applicable law, we undertake no duty to update our Forward-Looking Statements.



Our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve:  Economic downturns, and in particular downturns in the energy, foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, pulp and paper, mining and steel industries, can adversely impact our end-users.  In recent years, the weak global economic environment, particularly in the United States and Europe, has negatively impacted many of our end-markets. The on-going uncertainty regarding the federal budget and fiscal policy in the United States may further weaken the U.S. and global economy.   Further decline in economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets. During such downturns, these end-users typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business.



Our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors:



Other regions of the world also expose us to foreign currency risk.  For example, we do business in Venezuela, which experienced a currency devaluation in 2010 and again in 2013.  A similar currency devaluation in other countries could have a negative impact on our financial performance.










We may encounter difficulties completing the Nalco integration and fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the merger:On December 1, 2011, we completed the Nalco merger.  The merger involves the combination of two companies that historically operated as independent public companies.  We have devoted, and will need to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of Nalco. Potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process, which may preclude us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger, including expected synergies, include the following:



·complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including the challenge of integrating complex information technology systems, communications systems, financial reporting systems, supply chain and procurement arrangements and other assets of Nalco in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;



·the possibility that our businesses may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the impact of the integration on employees and customers;



·potential unknown liabilities in the legacy Nalco business or arising out of the integration;



·unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration;



·the inability to successfully combine the businesses of Ecolab and Nalco in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from the merger;



·problems that may arise in integrating the workforces of the two companies, including the possible loss of key employees;



·potential problems in maintaining and integrating effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company; and



·the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce the combined company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.



The pending acquisition of Champion may present certain risks to the business and operations of Ecolab and to the combined company following the acquisition:On October 11, 2012, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among Ecolab, OFC Technologies Corp., a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ecolab, and Permian Mud Service, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Permian”).  Permian is the parent company of Champion Technologies, Inc. and Corsicana Technologies, Inc. (together with Permian, “Champion”).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of each of Ecolab and Permian and the shareholders of Permian, we will acquire Champion by way of a merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the acquisition, the shares of common stock of Permian issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn) will be converted into the right to receive merger consideration of approximately $2.16 billion, subject to customary adjustments for cash, debt and working capital and certain additional adjustments as set out in the Merger Agreement. Subject to certain adjustments, the merger consideration will be paid










approximately 75% in cash and 25% in shares of Ecolab common stock. Additionally, we will be required to pay to the Permian stockholders an additional amount in cash, up to $100 million in the aggregate, equal to 50% of the incremental federal tax on the merger consideration as a result of increases in applicable capital gains and investment taxes after December 31, 2012.



The consummation of the Champion acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including approval of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-trust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR Act”).



The closing of the pending Champion acquisition is subject to a number of risks, including, among other things, risks that:



·the regulatory approvals or clearances required for the acquisition, including clearance under the HSR Act, may not be obtained, or required regulatory approvals may delay the transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the Company or cause the Company to abandon the transaction, in which case it will not realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition;



·the other conditions to the closing of the acquisition may not be satisfied resulting in the Company abandoning the transaction, in which case it will not realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition;



·a material adverse change, event or occurrence may affect the Company or Champion prior to the closing of the transaction and may delay the acquisition or cause the Company to abandon the transaction, in which case it will not realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition;



In addition, if the acquisition is completed, the anticipated success of the acquisition is subject to a number of risks, including, among other things, risks that:



·problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the Company and Champion, particularly in light of the continuing integration efforts and challenges resulting from the Nalco merger, which may result in the combined business not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected;



·the acquisition may involve unexpected costs, unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays;



·the credit ratings of the Company may be different from what the Company currently expects;



·the businesses of the Company or Champion may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the acquisition; and



·disruptions from the transaction could harm relationships with customers, employees and suppliers.



Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of the Company and the combined business.



We expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our proposed acquisition of Champion, including professional fees and other fees, costs and expenses.  If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Champion a termination fee of $100 million.  We also expect to incur significant integration and restructuring fees and costs following completion of the acquisition.










We depend on key personnel to lead our business:  Our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees, particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities. This is especially crucial as we continue to integrate Nalco and potentially integrate Champion as important resources are shifted to planning and executing key integration initiatives as well as cost and growth synergies.  During this stage in the integration, experienced business and financial leaders and experts are critical to the success of these and other acquisitions.  Our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us.



If we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives, our business could be adversely affected:  In addition to the Nalco merger and the potential Champion acquisition, we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns. In particular, in 2011 we announced various initiatives to capture financial and operational benefits in our European business, in part, by leveraging our ERP system, and to improve our competitiveness in the region.  Those initiatives remain in progress, and integration activities could impact our ability to timely execute these initiatives.  If the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.



We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security:We rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack.  Recent acquisitions, including the Nalco merger, have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in the system’s infrastructure.  Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.



Our significant non-U.S. operations expose us to global economic, political and legal risks that could impact our profitability:We have significant operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other alliances. We conduct business in approximately 170 countries and, in 2012, approximately 50% of our net sales originated outside the United States. There are inherent risks in our international operations, including:



·exchange controls and currency restrictions;



·currency fluctuations and devaluations;



·tariffs and trade barriers;



·export duties and quotas;



·changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials, energy and utilities;



·changes in local economic conditions;



·changes in laws and regulations;



·difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with foreign laws;



·difficulties in collecting receivables or realizing other assets;










·requirements to include local ownership or management in our business;



·exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other government actions;



·restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries;



·unsettled political conditions, military action, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict; and



·countries whose governments have been hostile to U.S.-based businesses.



Also, because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights, we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments. We are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty, which has impacted our business in some countries. Other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors.



Further, our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, as well as U.S. economic sanctions regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations; however, there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the reckless acts of employees or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures.  Violations of such laws and regulations could result in investigations of the Company and sanctions, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social, legal and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



Our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations:  Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards, and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally, including employment and labor laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs.  Regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards, causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs. The potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance. Changes to current laws (including tax laws), regulations and policies could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



We are a defendant in seven wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) or a similar state law.  One of the cases, Doug Ladore v. Ecolab Inc., et al., United States District Court for the Central District of California, case no. CV 11-9386 GAF (FMOx), is a putative wage hour class action brought on behalf of California Pest Elimination employees.  The case has been certified for class treatment, and on January 22, 2013, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment was granted and the court found that the class of employees was entitled to overtime pay.  On February 22, 2013, we reached a preliminary settlement with the plaintiffs, which remains subject to court approval.










There can be no assurance that other pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled.



Our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our COREXIT dispersant in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs:Our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our COREXIT dispersant in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs.  On April 22, 2010, the deepwater drilling platform, the Deepwater Horizon, operated by a subsidiary of BP plc, sank in the Gulf of Mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on April 20, 2010. A massive oil spill resulted. Approximately one week following the incident, subsidiaries of BP plc, under the authorization of the responding federal agencies, formally requested our indirect subsidiary, Nalco Company, to supply large quantities of COREXIT 9500, a Nalco oil dispersant product listed on the U.S. EPA National Contingency Plan Product Schedule. Nalco Company responded immediately by providing available COREXIT and increasing production to supply the product to BP’s subsidiaries for use, as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government.



Nalco Company and certain affiliates (collectively “Nalco”) was named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event.  The plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability, tort and other theories. Nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters.  Nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants.



All butone of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana with other related cases under In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig “Deepwater Horizon” in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, Case No. 10-md-02179 (E.D. La.) (the “MDL”). The remaining case is Franks v. Sea Tow of South Miss, Inc., et al, Cause No. A2402-10-228 (Circuit Court of Harrison County Mississippi) (the “Remaining Case”).



Nalco Company, the incident defendants and the other responder defendants havebeen named as third party defendantsby Transocean Deepwater Drilling, Inc. and its affiliates (the “Transocean Entities”) (In re the Complaint and Petition of Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, et al, MDL No. 2179, Civil Action 10-2771). In April and May 2011, the Transocean Entities, Cameron International Corporation, Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., M-I L.L.C., Weatherford U.S., L.P. and Weatherford International, Inc. (collectively, the “Cross Claimants”) filed cross claims in MDL 2179 against Nalco Company and other unaffiliated cross defendants. The Cross Claimants generally allege, among other things, that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon explosion, oil spill and/or spill response, they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants.



On November 28, 2012, the Federal Court in the MDL entered an order dismissing all claims against Nalco.  Because claims remain pending against other defendants, the Court’s decision is not a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal.  Plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the Court’s decision.  Nalco will request that the Remaining Case be similarly dismissed for the reasons accepted in the MDL.  We cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal, the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation.  However, if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won, or if the remaining state court case is not dismissed, these suits could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated result of operations, financial position and cash flows.










Our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value, innovation and customer support:  Our competitive market is made up of numerous global, national, regional and local competitors. Our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative, high value-added products for niche applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future. In addition, certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets. If we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis, we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.



Our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials:  The prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time, and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs. Changes in raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our business.



We have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility:As of December 31, 2012, we had net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) of $5.4 billion.  Our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business, consolidated results of operations and financial position including in the following respects:



·requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to debt service obligations, thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general operating requirements and opportunities;



·limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service obligations and other general operating requirements;



·placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;



·limiting flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate, which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations; and



·increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions.



In addition, approximately $750 million of our debt is floating rate debt.  A one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately $7.5 million per year.  Accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.



If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify.



If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions, our business could be adversely affected: As part of our long-term strategy, we seek to acquire complementary businesses. There can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses. If the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses










deteriorates, the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected.



We enter into multi-year contracts with customers that can impact our results:   Our multi-year contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations.



Consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results:  Customers and vendors in the foodservice, hospitality, travel, healthcare, food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue. This consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations.



Severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business:  Our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic.  The United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, public health outbreaks such as Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1 influenza.  A prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets.  Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business.



We incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the Nalco merger and other acquisitions:



Future events may impact our deferred tax position, including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely:We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more










likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position.  Further, should the Company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.



Extraordinary events may significantly impact our business:  The occurrence of (a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (d) natural or manmade disasters, (e) water shortages or (f) severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.



Defense of litigation, particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust, patent infringement, wage hour and class action lawsuits, can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful, and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



While we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse effect on our financial position.



War (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or manmade disasters, water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy, foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, pulp and paper, mining, steel and other industries cause a downturn in the business of our customers, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
