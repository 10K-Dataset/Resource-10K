Item 1A.RISK FACTORS

This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our
business or others on our behalf, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic
conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and
stock price.

Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.

Sales of all of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from
third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers may regulate prices, reimbursement levels and/or access to our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our
products. We rely in large part on the reimbursement of our principal products through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in foreign countries and a reduction in the coverage and/or
reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.

In March 2010 the United States adopted
significant healthcare reform through the enactment of the PPACA and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (See Item 1. Business — Reimbursement — U.S. Healthcare Reform.) A major goal of the healthcare reform law is to
provide greater access to healthcare coverage for more Americans. Accordingly, the healthcare reform law requires individual U.S. citizens and legal residents to maintain qualifying health coverage, imposes certain requirements on employers with
respect to offering health coverage to employees, amends insurance regulations regarding when coverage can be provided and denied to individuals, and expands existing government healthcare coverage programs to more individuals in more situations,
with most of these changes going into effect by January 2014. We do not expect a significant increase in sales of our products as a result of the 2014 expansions in healthcare coverage. While we cannot fully predict the ultimate impact the
healthcare reform law will have on us, or how the law may change due to statutory revision or judicial review, we expect that the new law will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Public and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment initiatives, including
increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products. A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on

Prolia®and XGEVA®are not bisphosphonates, there is the possibility that CMS might evaluate other agents, including RANK Ligand
inhibitors such as Prolia®and XGEVA®.

Additional initiatives addressing
the coverage or reimbursement of our products could result in less extensive coverage or lower reimbursement, which could negatively affect sales of our products. If, for any of these or other reasons, reimbursement rates are reduced, or if
healthcare providers anticipate reimbursement being reduced, providers may narrow the circumstances in which they prescribe or administer our products, which could reduce the use and/or sales of our products. A reduction in the use and sales of our
products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our current products and products
in development cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.

Our business is subject
to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain
approval from regulatory authorities before we can







®

®

®

®

®

Some of our products are approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. Regulatory authorities
are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. Vectibix®, for example, received accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the EU, with full
approval conditioned on conducting additional clinical trials of the use of Vectibix®as a therapy in treating
mCRC. (See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products — Other Marketed Products — Vectibix®(panitumumab).) If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products’ accelerated or conditional approval, we may not
receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products’ labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market.

Following recent FDA and FDA advisory committee discussions and actions with respect to other therapeutic oncology products previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA, questions remain about
regulatory authorities’ views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival but have not shown a statistically significant
improvement in overall survival. A number of our products and product candidates have

In
addition to the clinical trials that we choose to or are required to conduct, other organizations may also conduct clinical trials that use our products. Such clinical trials may evaluate our products in areas in which we do not have and are not
seeking an approved indication. However, negative results or safety signals arising in other organizations’ clinical trials may nonetheless prompt regulatory agencies to take regulatory actions that affect our approved indications, including
requiring the addition of relevant safety data to the approved labeling or even withdrawing approval for our products.

The occurrence of a number of high profile safety events has caused an increased public and governmental concern about potential safety issues relating to pharmaceutical and biological products and
certain of our products and product candidates. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) As a result of this increased concern in recent years, the U.S. regulatory environment has evolved and safety
signals and safety concerns resulting from pre-clinical data, clinical trials (including sub-analyses and meta-analyses), market use or other sources are receiving greater scrutiny. For example, a number of regulatory agencies around the world,
including the FDA and the EMA, have initiated programs to directly monitor for safety issues rather than wait for patients, providers or manufacturers to report safety problems with products or medical devices. And at least one private, for-profit
company has begun aggregating and analyzing FDA adverse event data on its website using its own independent methodology, which could highlight new perceived risks of our products and product candidates. Actual or perceived safety problems or signals
could lead to revised or restrictive labeling of our approved products or a class of products, potentially including limitations on the use of approved products in certain patients because of:



•the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns with respect to any of our products by regulatory agencies;



•an increased rate or number of previously-identified safety-related events;



•the discovery of significant problems or safety signals or trends with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products;







•subsequent concerns about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying the label or changes to the underlying safety/efficacy analysis related
to results from clinical trials, including sub-analyses, or meta-analysis (a meta-analysis is the review of studies using various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) of clinical trials or clinical data
performed by us or others; and



•new legislation or rules by regulatory agencies.

For example, in December 2009, based on the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp®Therapy (TREAT) results, we updated the boxed warning in the labeling information for ESAs, to reflect an increased
risk of stroke when ESAs are administered to CRF patients to target Hb levels of 13 g/dL and above. In October 2010, we submitted additional proposed labeling changes regarding the use of ESAs in CRF patients not on dialysis that would limit
treatment to patients who are most likely to benefit, specifically those with significant anemia (<10 g/dL), and who are at high risk for transfusion and for whom transfusion avoidance is considered clinically important, including those in whom
it is important to preserve kidney transplant eligibility. In June 2011, we announced that the FDA had approved further changes to the labels for the use of ESAs, including Aranesp®and EPOGEN®, in patients with
CKD. (See Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.)

In addition to
revised labeling for our products, discovery of new safety information or previously unknown safety concerns and/or safety signals with our products or similar products could also lead to:



•requirement of risk management activities (including a REMS) or other FDA compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;



•mandated PMCs/PMRs or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;



•product recalls of our approved products;



•revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas, and/or;



•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and



•fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies.

Product safety concerns could cause regulatory agencies to impose risk management activities upon us (including a REMS),
which may require substantial costs and resources to negotiate, develop, implement and administer. The results of these risk management activities could:



•impact the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe, dispense or use our products;



•limit patient access to our products;



•reduce patient willingness to use our products;



•place administrative burdens on healthcare providers in prescribing our products; and



•affect our ability to compete against products that do not have a REMS or similar risk management activities.

We currently have approved REMS for our ESAs,
Prolia®and Nplate®, and we use third-party service providers to assist in the administration of our REMS that include elements to assure safe use. For example, our ESA REMS requires
applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program, receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time. We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements
of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the ESA REMS and providing the FDA with periodic assessment reports to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. If we or third-party service providers acting on our behalf fail to
effectively implement and/or administer the REMS for our products, we may be required to modify such REMS, and we may be subject to FDA enforcement actions or to civil penalties.

Current global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may
magnify certain risks that affect our business.







results of operations. Any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of
our manufacturing facilities.

In Europe, economic conditions across the region could potentially be impacted
by countries of key concern like Greece, which is facing possible default of its sovereign debt obligations, and Spain, France and Italy, whose sovereign debt obligations were recently downgraded. Economic conditions continue to affect our
operations and performance outside the United States as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including drugs and biologics. (See Our sales depend on
coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.)

We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The value of our investments may be adversely affected by
interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment
charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments.

Our ESAs continue to be
under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.

the QIP and consideration of a possible NCD to manage anemia in patients with CKD and dialysis-related anemia. Further restrictions are possible as the regional MACs implement LCDs to address
Medicare coverage for ESAs in CKD not on dialysis within their respective geographic areas, and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement, use and sales of Aranesp®. (See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.) Together, these labeling and reimbursement changes, along with the approved REMS for
ESAs, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations. We do not know what effect, if any, the June 2011 ESA label changes will have on the final version of the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes group (KDIGO) global anemia clinical practice guidelines which KDIGO has indicated could be available by early 2012. (See Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our
products.)

®

®

Regulatory authorities outside the United States have also reviewed and scrutinized the use of ESAs.
In June 2008, the EMA recommended updating the product information for ESAs with a new warning for their use in cancer patients, which was approved by the EC in October 2008. The product information for all ESAs was updated to advise that, in some
clinical situations, blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anemia in patients with cancer and that the decision to administer ESAs should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the
individual patient. Following the October 2008 revision, we experienced a reduction of Aranesp®sales in the
supportive cancer care setting in the EU. In addition, following the June 2011 ESA label changes in the United States, regulatory agencies outside the United States have sought additional information from us about the use and safety of ESAs in the
CKD setting. Additional labeling or reimbursement changes by these regulatory authorities could materially and adversely affect the reimbursement, use and sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations.

We continue to receive results from meta-analyses or previously initiated clinical trials using ESAs,
including PMCs. For example, in May 2009, the Cochrane Collaboration published its independent meta-analysis of patient-level data from previously conducted, randomized, controlled, clinical studies evaluating ESAs in cancer patients which we
submitted to the FDA and the EMA. This Cochrane meta-analysis of patient-level data from previous studies corroborates prior analyses indicating that the use of ESAs may increase the risk of death in cancer patients. The studies in the analysis all
predate the current label, which advises using the least amount of ESA necessary to avoid transfusion, but they do not exclude the potential for adverse outcomes when ESAs are prescribed according to the current label. In addition, data from the
RED-HF®trial evaluating the effect of treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa on morbidity and mortality in
patients with symptomatic left ventricular heart failure is anticipated in 2012. Unfavorable results from these or similar trials or meta-analyses







of previous clinical trials could materially and adversely affect the use and sales of our ESAs, our business and results of operations.

We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for
new indications.

Before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our
product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. (See Our current products and products in development
cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and
patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs,
delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.

We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. We also may acquire
companies that have ongoing clinical trials. These trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and
liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not
complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate, a new indication for an existing product or information to support a current indication, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site, not approve the product
candidate or new indication or maintain approval of the current indication in its current form or at all, and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party
vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in
combination with one of our product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the
quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, gain or
maintain regulatory approvals worldwide on a timely basis, if at all.







Patients may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects in the
course of our, our licensees, partners or independent investigators’ clinical trials which could:



•delay the clinical trial program;



•require additional or longer trials to gain approval;



•prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products; and



•render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas.

Safety signals, trends, adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed
by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) or from the marketed use of our drugs or similar products that result in revised safety-related labeling or restrictions on the use of our approved products could negatively
impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use and sales of our products, regulatory or private health organization medical guidelines and reimbursement for our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However
in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on an out of date standard
of medical care, limiting the utility and application of such trials. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or
maintenance of our current labels on this basis. Further, clinical trials conducted by others, including our licensees, partners or independent investigators, may result in unfavorable clinical trials results that may call into question the safety
of our products in off-label or on label uses that may result in label restrictions and/or additional trials.

Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a pharmacovigilance program of our product or for approval of a new indication.
For example, we have initiated Study ‘782 as part of our Aranesp®oncology pharmacovigilance program. (See
Our ESAs continue to be under review and receive scrutiny by regulatory authorities.) In connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical
trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could
have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our
products.

We expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products.

We currently face competition in Europe from biosimilar products, and we expect to face increasing competition from
biosimilars in the future. In 2010, lawmakers in the United States enacted healthcare reform legislation which included an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. The EU has already created such a regulatory pathway. To the
extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of
applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents.

In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years.
In 2006, the EMA developed and issued final regulatory guidelines related to the development and approval of biosimilar products. The final guidelines included clinical trial guidance for certain biosimilar products, including erythropoietins and
G-CSFs, recommending that applicants seeking approval of such biosimilar products conduct pharmacodynamic, toxicological and clinical safety studies as well as a pharmacovigilance program. In late 2011, the EMA







announced plans to issue in the first half of 2012 final guidelines on the approval process for biosimilar monoclonal antibodies and draft guidelines on the approval process for other biosimilar
drugs. Some companies have received and other companies are seeking approval to market erythropoietin and G-CSF biosimilars in the EU, presenting additional competition for our products. (See Our marketed products face substantial competition.) For
example, following the expiration of the principal European patent relating to recombinant G-CSF in August 2006, the EC issued marketing authorizations for the first G-CSF biosimilar products and the products were launched in certain EU countries in
2008 and 2009. There are now several G-CSF biosimilars available in the EU marketed by different companies and these G-CSF biosimilar products compete with NEUPOGEN®and Neulasta®. Further, as in
an effort to reduce costs, countries in the EU may in the future permit the automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding innovator products or adopt other biosimilar uptake measures. We cannot predict to what extent the
entry of biosimilar products or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the EU. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

We
may not be able to develop commercial products.

Successful product development in the biotechnology
industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects produce a commercial product. We intend to continue to make significant R&D investments. Product candidates or new indications for existing products (collectively, “product
candidates”) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:



•the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for
reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine;



•the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;







•the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics;



•the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals;



•the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use;



•the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;



•other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on
reasonable terms, or at all;



•we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical
manufacturing activities; and



•the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined.

Several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process.
For example, in June 2004, we announced that the phase 2 study of Glial Cell Lined-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease did not meet the primary study endpoint upon completion of nine months of
the double-blind treatment phase of the study. The conclusion was reached even though a small phase 1 pilot investigator-initiated open-label study over a three-year period appeared to result in improvements for advanced Parkinson’s disease
patients. Subsequently, we discontinued clinical development of GDNF in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease.

Our marketed products face substantial competition.

Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may
negatively impact our bargaining power and profit margins.

The substantial majority of
our U.S. product sales are made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include
physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In addition, one of our products,
EPOGEN®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation.
Two organizations, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for a substantial majority of all EPOGEN®sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial
purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on







our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins.

Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (See Note 18, Contingencies and commitments, in
the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report.) Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts, fines, penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs
and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages
or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We
may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention and
adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. Amgen and Immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.

®







Throughout these investigations, the government entities are asserting that
we violated various state and federal laws. These investigations are very burdensome, expensive and time-consuming for us to explain and defend to these entities. Although we cannot predict whether additional proceedings may be initiated against us,
or predict when these matters may be resolved, it is not unusual for investigations such as these to continue for a considerable period of time and to require management’s attention and significant legal expense. A determination that we are in
violation of the various federal and state laws that govern the sales and marketing of our products could result in federal criminal liability and/or federal or state civil or administrative liability, and thus could result in substantial financial
damages or criminal penalties and possible exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, we may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. Any of these
results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We rely on third-party suppliers
for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.

We rely on unaffiliated third-party
suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those
unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until
the regulatory agency approved such supplier.

Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw
materials, medical devices and components include:



•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;



•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier;



•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;



•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise;



•failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; and



•discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components.

These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could
materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our
products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN®glass vials). We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in
delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from
biological sources, including mammalian tissues. In addition, one of our marketed products also uses bovine serum and human serum albumin. Some countries in which we market our products may restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances
in the manufacture of drugs. We continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be
subject to contamination and/or recall.

A material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restriction of the
use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials, which may be sourced from other countries and that are used in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our products or







could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market. This could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our
product sales, business and operating results. Further, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our
ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a
material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays
could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.

Manufacturing biologic
human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We currently manufacture all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to
produce or assist in the production of ENBREL, Prolia®,
Sensipar®/Mimpara®, Nplate®, XGEVA®and Vectibix®and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. Our ability to adequately and timely
manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:



•availability or contamination of raw materials, components and equipment used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no
other source or supplier;



•capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers;



•contamination by microorganisms or viruses;



•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;



•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak, natural disaster, or otherwise;



•degree of compliance with regulatory requirements;



•changes in forecasts of future demand;



•timing and actual number of production runs;



•updating of manufacturing specifications;



•production success rates and yields; and



•timing and outcome of product quality testing.

If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, supply
constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. For example, over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. (See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold if
we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval.) If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products,
which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations.

Our
manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA or other regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take
longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. For example, in order to maintain supply and to satisfy anticipated future
demand for denosumab, we are qualifying the expansion of our existing bulk protein facilities at our Puerto Rico site. In addition, in order mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our formulation and fill operations being performed in a
single facility, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our Puerto Rico site, and are modifying







and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in Ireland. Upon completion, these facilities will require licensure by the various regulatory authorities.

We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing
activities at our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our Thousand Oaks, California manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the
Puerto Rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the Thousand Oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.

We currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®, Aranesp®, EPOGEN®, Prolia®and XGEVA®and substantially
all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for ENBREL at our manufacturing facility in Juncos, Puerto Rico. We also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for Neulasta®, NEUPOGEN®and Aranesp®and the purification of bulk EPOGEN®material at this facility, and plan to perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for Prolia®and XGEVA®at the Puerto Rico
facility once the facility has been approved by the FDA for that purpose. We perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our
manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. A number of factors could materially and
adversely affect our operations, including:



•power failures and/or other utility failures;



•breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment;



•improper installation or operation of equipment;



•labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of a pandemic flu outbreak;



•inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components;



•natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes or fires; and



•failures to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA.

In the past, the Puerto Rico facility has experienced manufacturing component shortages and there was evidence of adverse
trends in the microbial bioburden of the production environment that reduced the production output. The same or other problems may result in our being unable to supply these products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales,
business and operating results. Although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses, there can be no assurance that such







coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The extent of the coverage of our insurance could limit our ability to mitigate
for lost sales and such losses could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. Our Puerto Rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our
other manufacturing facilities. For example, the limited number of lots of ENBREL and EPOGEN®voluntarily
recalled in 2009 and 2010 were manufactured at our Puerto Rico facility. In future inspections, our failure to adequately address the FDA’s expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (See Manufacturing
difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.)

Our intellectual
property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation.

Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act may be the
subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our biologic
products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period
provided under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.

Over the next several years, many of
the existing patents on our principal products will expire. (See Item 1. Business — Marketed Products.) As our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars,
which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. (See Item 7A. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition, Liquidity
and Capital Resources.) We have received,







and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of
our products. However, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. For example, while we do not expect biosimilars competition on ENBREL in the United States for the
foreseeable future, there are a number of competing therapies currently on the market and more in clinical development that are different from ENBREL but are used to treat the same inflammatory diseases treated by ENBREL. Although we continue to
develop new products, and obtain patent protection for these new product candidates, we may not be able to replace the revenue lost upon the expiration of the patents on our current products.

Our stock price is volatile.

Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and
operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or
projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations.

We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. We may access the capital markets to
supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan
to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our
securities.

Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.

Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products.
However, professional societies, HTA organizations, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or
recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of
related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. Recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients,







healthcare providers and payers could result in decreased use and/or dosage of our products. Some examples of agency and organizational guidelines include:



•In August 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) distributed to the nephrology community final updated Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in CKD. The NKF-KDOQI™ Anemia Work Group recommended in its 2007 Update to the NKF-KDOQI™ Anemia Management Guidelines that physicians target
Hb in the range of 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL, and also stipulated that the target not be above 13 g/dL.



•In December 2008, the KDIGO, a not-for-profit foundation managed by NKF, announced that it was developing a new global anemia guideline. The
announcement stated that an updated anemia guideline is necessary in light of new study results, particularly the data from the TREAT trial, which had become available since the NKF-KDOQI™’s clinical practice guidelines and clinical
practice recommendations for anemia in CKD were released. On September 30, 2011, the KDIGO released its draft global anemia clinical practice guidelines for public review and comment. KDIGO has indicated that final guidelines could be available
by early 2012.



•In February 2007, following the reported results from our Anemia of Cancer 103 Study, the U.S. Pharmacopoeia Dispensing Information Drug Reference
Guides removed Aranesp®in the treatment of anemia of cancer.

In addition, HTA organizations, such as NICE in the UK and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, make
reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments.

Any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially
and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could
adversely affect the market price for our common stock.

The commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the
marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners.

We have entered into agreements
with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (See Item 1. Business — Business Relationships.) Many of these
agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. If our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to
coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected.

Our corporate
compliance and risk mitigation programs cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or that we effectively manage all
operational risks.

The development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and
reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the United States and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (See Our current products and products in development
cannot be sold if we do not maintain or gain regulatory approval and manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance
program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and/or laws or all potentially applicable foreign regulations
and/or laws. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations and/or laws, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions
on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. Additionally, while we have implemented numerous risk
mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee







that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. If we fail to effectively mitigate all operational risks, our product supply may be negatively impacted, which could have a
material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.

Cost savings initiatives may result
in the carrying value of certain existing manufacturing facilities or other assets becoming impaired or other related charges being incurred.

Our business continues to face many challenges. In response to these challenges, we have worked and continue to work to improve cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures. As part of those
efforts, we undertake cost savings initiatives to evaluate our processes and procedures in order to identify opportunities for achieving greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business. In particular, we evaluate our manufacturing operations to
identify opportunities to increase production yields and/or success rates as well as capacity utilization. Depending on the timing and outcomes of these cost savings initiatives, the carrying value of certain manufacturing or other assets may not be
fully recoverable and could result in the recognition of impairment and/or other related charges. The recognition of such charges, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. Our
provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, there are several proposals under consideration in the United States to reform tax law, including proposals that may
reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. While it is uncertain how the U.S. Congress may address U.S. tax policy matters in the future, reform of U.S. taxation, including taxation of international
income, continues to be a topic of discussion for the U.S. Congress and the Administration. A significant change to the U.S. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of international income, could have a material and adverse effect on our
business and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or
repurchase stock.
