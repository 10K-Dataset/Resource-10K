Item 1A. RISK FACTORS



Youshould carefully consider the following riskfactors in addition to the other informationincluded in this

Annual Report on Form 10-K.These risk factors are not the only riskswe face.Our business could also be

affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currentlyknown to us or that we currently consider to be

immaterial.If any of these risks were to occur, our business, operating results and financialcondition, as well

as the value of an investment in our commonstock could be adversely affected.



Our operating results, our future rate of growthand the carrying value of our assets are exposedto the

effects of changing commodity prices.



Prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs andLNG can fluctuate widely.Brent crude oil prices

averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging froma low of $53 per barrel in January to a high of almost$75 per

barrel in April.Given volatility in commodity price driversand the worldwide political and economic

environment generally, as well as increased uncertainty generated by recent (andpotential future) armed

hostilities in various oil-producing regions around theglobe, price trends may continue to be volatile.Our

revenues, operating results and future rate of growthare highly dependent on the priceswe receive for our

crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs andLNG.The factors influencing these prices arebeyond our control.



Lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGL andLNG prices may have a material adverse effect on our

revenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amountof dividends we elect to

declare and pay on our common stock and theamount of shares we elect to acquire aspart of the share

repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions.Lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves

we can produce economically, adversely affecting our proved reserves, reserve replacementratio and

accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levelsas we continue production from upstreamfields.



Significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, naturalgas, NGLs and LNG prices could also requireus to reduce

our capital expenditures, impair the carrying valueof our assets or discontinue the classificationof certain

assets as proved reserves.In the past three years, we recognized severalimpairments, which are described in

Note 9—Impairments and the “APLNG” sectionof Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables,

in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.If commodity prices remain low relativeto their historic

levels, and as we continue to optimize our investmentsand exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely

we will incur future impairments to long-lived assetsused in operations, investments in nonconsolidated

entities accounted for under the equity method andunproved properties.Although it is not reasonably

practicable to quantify the impact of any futureimpairments at this time, our results of operationscould be

adversely affected as a result.



Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchaseshares is subject to certain considerations.



Dividends are authorized and determined byour Board of Directors in its sole discretionand depend upon a

number of factors, including:



●



Cash available for distribution.

●



Our results of operations and anticipated futureresults of operations.

●



Our financial condition, especially in relationto the anticipated future capital needs of ourproperties.

●



The level of distributions paid by comparable companies.

●



Our operating expenses.

●



Other factors our Board of Directors deemsrelevant.



We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our Board of Directors may

reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividendsat any time, including if it determines thatour net cash

provided by operating activities,after deducting capital expenditures and investments,are not sufficient to pay

our desired levels of dividends to our stockholdersor to pay dividends to our stockholders at all.






Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authorityremained of the $15 billion share

repurchase program our Board of Directors hadauthorized.In February, 2020, our Board of Directors

approved an increase to our repurchase authorizationfrom $15 billion to $25 billion, to supportour plan for

future share repurchases.Our share repurchase program does not obligateus to acquire a specific number of

shares during any period, and our decision tocommence, discontinue or resume repurchasesin any period will

depend on the same factors that our Board ofDirectors may consider when declaring dividends,among others.



Any downward revision in the amount of dividendswe pay to stockholders or the number of shareswe

purchase under our share repurchase program couldhave an adverse effect on the market price of our common

stock.



We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptableterms.



We have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fundour operations and

strategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access tothe debt and equity capital markets for

funding.There can be no assurance that additional debtor equity financing will be available in the futureon

acceptable terms, or at all.In addition, although we anticipate wewill be able to repay our existing

indebtedness when it matures or in accordancewith our stated plans, there can be no assurancewe will be able

to do so.Our ability to obtain additional financing, orrefinance our existing indebtedness when it maturesor

in accordance with our plans, will be subject to anumber of factors, including market conditions,our operating

performance, investor sentiment and our abilityto incur additional debt in compliance with agreements

governing our then-outstanding debt.If we are unable to generate sufficient funds fromoperations or raise

additional capital for any reason, our business couldbe adversely affected.



In addition, we are regularly evaluated by the majorrating agencies based on a number of factors,including

our financial strength and conditions affecting the oiland gas industry generally.We and other industry

companies have had their ratings reduced in thepast due to negative commodity price outlooks.Any

downgrade in our credit rating or announcementthat our credit rating is under review for possibledowngrade

could increase the cost associated with any additionalindebtedness we incur.



Our business may be adversely affected by deteriorationin the credit quality of, or defaults under our

contracts with, third parties with whom we dobusiness.





The operation of our business requires us to engagein transactions with numerous counterpartiesoperating in a

variety of industries, including other companiesoperating in the oil and gas industry.These counterparties

may default on their obligations to us as a resultof operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other

reasons, including bankruptcy.Market speculation about the credit qualityof these counterparties, or their

ability to continue performing on their existing obligations,may also exacerbate any operational difficultiesor

liquidity issues they are experiencing, particularlyas it relates to other companies in the oil and gas industryas

a result of the volatility in commodity prices.Any default by any of our counterparties mayresult in our

inability to perform our obligations under agreementswe have made with third parties or may otherwise

adversely affect our business or results of operations.In addition, our rights against any of our counterparties

as a result of a default may not be adequate tocompensate us for the resulting harm causedor may not be

enforceable at all in some circumstances.We may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to

enforce any rights we have against a defaultingcounterparty, which could further adversely impact our results

of operations.



In particular, in August 2018, we entered into a settlementagreement with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.

(PDVSA) providing for the payment of approximately$2 billion over a five-year period in connectionwith an

arbitration award issued by the InternationalChamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal in favor of ConocoPhillips

on a contractual dispute arising from Venezuela’s expropriation of our interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca

heavy oil ventures and other pre-expropriationfiscal measures.We collected approximately $0.8 billion of the

$2.0 billion settlement in 2018 and 2019.PDVSA has defaulted on its remaining paymentobligations under

this agreement, we are therefore now forced toincur additional costs as we seek to recover anyunpaid amounts

under the agreement.






Unless we successfully add to our existing provedreserves, our future crude oil, bitumen,natural gas and

NGL production will decline, resulting in anadverse impact to our business.



The rate of production from upstream fieldsgenerally declines as reserves are depleted.If we do not conduct

successful exploration and development activities,or, through engineering studies, optimize production

performance or identify additional or secondaryrecovery reserves, our proved reserveswill decline materially

as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas andNGLs, and our business will experience reduced cashflows

and results of operations.Any cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a resultof commodity price

declines may further limit our ability to replacedepleted reserves.



The exploration and production of oil and gasis a highly competitive industry.



The exploration and production of crude oil,bitumen, natural gas and NGLs is a highlycompetitive business.

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of theexploration and production

business, including to locate and obtain newsources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen,natural gas and

NGLs in an efficient, cost-effective manner.Some of our competitors are larger and have greaterresources

than we do or may be willing to incur a higherlevel of risk than we are willing to incur to obtainpotential

sources of supply.If we are not successful in our competitionfor new reserves, our financial condition and

results of operations may be adversely affected.



Any material change in the factors and assumptionsunderlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen,natural

gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantityand value of those reserves.





Our proved reserve information included in this annualreport represents management’s best estimates based

on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumesto be recovered from underground accumulations of

crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs.Such volumes cannot be directly measuredand the estimates and

underlying assumptions used by management aresubject to substantial risk and uncertainty.Any material

changes in the factors and assumptions underlyingour estimates of these items could resultin a material

negative impact to the volume of reserves reportedor could cause us to incur impairment expenseson property

associated with the production of those reserves.Future reserve revisions could also resultfrom changes in,

among other things, governmental regulation.



We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operatingcosts as a result of our

compliance with existing and future environmentallaws and regulations.



Our business is subject to numerous laws and regulationsrelating to the protection of the environment, which

are expected to continue to have an increasingimpact on our operations in the U.S. and in othercountries in

which we operate.For a description of the most significant of theseenvironmental laws and regulations, see

the “Contingencies—Environmental” sectionof Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Condition and Results of Operations.These laws and regulations continue to increasein both number and

complexity and affect our operations with respect to, amongother things:



●



Permits required in connection with exploration,drilling, production and other activities.The

discharge of pollutants into the environment.

●



Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogenoxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions.

●



Carbon taxes.

●



The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposaland cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous

and nonhazardous wastes.

●



The dismantlement, abandonment and restorationof our properties and facilities at theend of their

useful lives.

●



Exploration and production activities incertain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields,oil

sands reservoirs and unconventional plays.






We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance,and remediation

expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations.Any failure by us to comply with existingor future

laws, regulations and other requirements could resultin administrative or civil penalties, criminalfines, other

enforcement actions or third-party litigationagainst us.To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are

not ultimately reflected in the prices of our productsand services, our business, financialcondition, results of

operations and cash flows in future periods couldbe materially adversely affected.



Existing and future laws, regulations and initiativesrelating to global climate change, such as limitations

on GHG emissions, may impact or limitour business plans, result in significant expenditures,promote

alternative uses of energy or reduce demandfor our products.



Continuing political and social attention to theissue of global climate change has resulted inboth existing and

pending international agreements and national,regional or local legislation and regulatorymeasures to limit

GHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbontaxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency

standards and incentives or mandates for renewableenergy.For example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined

the international community at the 21st Conferenceof the Parties of the United Nations Framework

Convention on Climate Change in Paris thatprepared an agreement requiring member countriesto review and

represent a progression in their intended GHGemission reduction goals every five yearsbeginning in 2020.

While the U.S. announced its intention to withdrawfrom the Paris Agreement, there is no guaranteethat the

commitments made by the U.S. will not be implemented,in whole or in part, by U.S. state and local

governments or by major corporations headquarteredin the U.S.In addition, our operations continue in

countries around the world which are party to,and have not announced an intent towithdraw from, the Paris

Agreement.The implementation of current agreements andregulatory measures, as well as any future

agreements or measures addressing climatechange and GHG emissions, may adverselyimpact the demand for

our products, impose taxes on our products or operationsor require us to purchase emission creditsor reduce

emission of GHGs from our operations.As a result, we may experience declines in commodityprices or incur

substantial capital expenditures and compliance,operating, maintenance and remediation costs,any of which

may have an adverse effect on our business and resultsof operations.



Additionally, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in pressureupon shareholders,

financial institutions and/or financial marketsto modify their relationships with oil and gas companiesand to

limit investments and/or funding to such companies,which could increase our costs or otherwiseadversely

affect our business and results of operations.



Furthermore, increasing attention to global climatechange has resulted in an increased likelihood of

governmental investigations and private litigation,which could increase our costs or otherwise adverselyaffect

our business.In 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, anda state government in California, NewYork, Washington,

Rhode Island and Maryland, as well as the PacificCoast Federation of Fishermen’s Association, Inc., filed

lawsuits against oil and gas companies, includingConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damagesand

equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.ConocoPhillips is vigorously defending againstthese

lawsuits.The ultimate outcome and impact to uscannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur

substantial legal costs associated with defendingthese and similar lawsuits in the future.



In addition, althoughwe design and operate our business operationsto accommodate expected climatic

conditions, to the extent there are significantchanges in the earth’s climate, such as more severe or frequent

weather conditions in the markets where we operateor the areas where our assets reside, we could incur

increased expenses, our operations could be adverselyimpacted, and demand for our products couldfall.

For more information on legislation or precursorsfor possible regulation relating to global climatechange that

affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company’s response, see the“Contingencies—

Climate Change” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of

Operations.






Domestic and worldwide political and economicdevelopments could damage our operations and materially

reduce our profitability and cash flows.



Actions of the U.S., state, local and foreigngovernments, through sanctions, tax and otherlegislation,

executive order and commercial restrictions,could reduce our operating profitability bothin the U.S. and

abroad.In certain locations, governments have imposedor proposed restrictions on our operations;special

taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparencyregulations that could require us to disclosecompetitively

sensitive information or might cause us to violatenon-disclosure laws of other countries.



One area subject to significant politicaland regulatory activity is the use of hydraulicfracturing, an essential

completion technique that facilitates productionof oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lowerpermeability

rock formations.A range of local, state, federal and national lawsand regulations currently govern or, in some

hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulicfracturing in some jurisdictions.Although hydraulic

fracturing has been conducted for many decades,a number of new laws, regulations and permitting

requirements are under consideration by theU.S. EPA and others which could result in increased costs,

operating restrictions, operational delays or limitthe ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.Certain

jurisdictions in which we operate, including stateand local governments in Colorado, have adoptedor are

considering regulations that could impose newor more stringent permitting, disclosureor other regulatory

requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oiland natural-gas operations, including subsurfacewater

disposal.In addition, certain interest groups have alsoproposed ballot initiatives and constitutional

amendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gasdevelopment generally and hydraulic fracturingin

particular.For example, in 2018, Colorado voters rejectedProposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that

would have drastically limited the use of hydraulicfracturing in Colorado.In the event that ballot initiatives,

local or state restrictions or prohibitions areadopted and result in more stringent limitationson the production

and development of oil and natural gas in areaswhere we conduct operations, we may incur significantcosts to

comply with such requirements or may experiencedelays or curtailment in the permittingor pursuit of

exploration, development or production activities.Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments,limitations

or prohibitions could have a material adverseeffect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial

condition and liquidity.



The U.S. government can also prevent or restrictus from doing business in foreign countries.These

restrictions and those of foreign governmentshave in the past limited our ability tooperate in, or gain access

to, opportunities in various countries.Actions by host governments, such as the expropriationof our oil assets

by the Venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue todo so in

the future.Changes in domestic and international regulationsmay affect our ability to collect payments such

as those pertaining to the settlement with PDVSAor the ICSID Award against the Government of Venezuela;

or to obtain or maintain permits, including thosenecessary for drilling and development of wellsin various

locations.



Local political and economic factors in internationalmarkets could have a material adverse effect on us.

Approximately 50 percent of our hydrocarbonproduction was derived from production outsidethe U.S. in

2019, and 39 percent of our proved reserves, asof December 31, 2019, were located outsidethe U.S.We are

subject to risks associated with operations in internationalmarkets, including changes in foreign governmental

policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen,NGLs or LNG pricing and taxation, otherpolitical,

economic or diplomatic developments (includingthe effect of international trade discussion and disputes),

changing political conditions and internationalmonetary and currency rate fluctuations.In addition, some

countries where we operate lack a fully independentjudiciary system.This, coupled with changes in foreign

law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations toincreased risks, including

increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in thosejurisdictions and increased risks of adverseactions by

local government authorities, such as expropriations.






Our business may be adversely affected by price controls,government-imposed limitations on productionof

crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs, or theunavailability of adequate gathering, processing,

compression, transportation, and pipelinefacilities and equipment for our productionof crude oil, bitumen,

natural gas and NGLs.



As discussed above, our operations are subjectto extensive governmental regulations.From time to time,

regulatory agencies have imposed price controlsand limitations on production by restrictingthe rate of flow of

crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL wellsbelow actual production capacity.Because legal requirements

are frequently changed and subject to interpretation,we cannot predict whether future restrictionson our

business may be enacted or become applicable tous.



Our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen,natural gas, NGLs and LNG that we producealso

depends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportationand

pipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessarydiluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural

gas, NGLs and LNG for transport.The facilities, equipment and diluents we relyon may be temporarily

unavailable to us due to market conditions, extremeweather events, regulatory reasons, mechanicalreasons or

other factors or conditions, many of which arebeyond our control.In addition, in certain newer plays, the

capacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluentsmay not be sufficient to accommodate productionfrom

existing and new wells, and construction and permittingdelays, permitting costs and regulatory or other

constraints could limit or delay the construction,manufacture or other acquisition of new facilitiesand

equipment.If any facilities, equipment or diluents, orany of the transportation methods and channelsthat we

rely on become unavailable for any period of time,we may incur increased costs to transportour crude oil,

bitumen, natural gas, NGLs and LNG for sale orwe may be forced to curtail our productionof crude oil,

bitumen, natural gas or NGLs.



Our investments in joint ventures decreaseour ability to manage risk.



We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may sharecontrol with our joint

venture partners.There is a risk our joint venture participants mayat any time have economic, business or

legal interests or goals that are inconsistent withthose of the joint venture or us, or our jointventure partners

may be unable to meet their economic or otherobligations and we may be required tofulfill those obligations

alone.Failure by us, or an entity in which we havea joint venture interest, to adequately managethe risks

associated with any operations, acquisitions ordispositions could have a material adverse effect on the

financial condition or results of operations of ourjoint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.



We may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue.



From time to time, we may seek to divest portionsof our business or investments thatare not important to our

ongoing strategic objectives.Any dispositions we undertake may involve numerousrisks and uncertainties,

any of which could adversely affect our results of operationsor financial condition.In particular, we may not

be able to successfully complete any dispositionon a timeline or on terms acceptableto us, if at all, whether

due to market conditions, regulatory challengesor other concerns.In addition, the reinvestment of capital

from disposition proceeds may not ultimatelyyield investment returns in line with our internalor external

expectations.Any dispositions we pursue may also result indisruption to other parts of our business,

including through the diversion of resourcesand management attention from our ongoingbusiness and other

strategic matters, or through the disruptionof relationships with our employees and keyvendors.Further, in

connection with any disposition, we may enter intotransition services agreements or undertakeindemnity or

other obligations that may result in additionalexpenses for us.We may also be required under applicable

accounting rules to recognize impairmentsassociated with any disposition we pursue,whether or not

completed.



As part of our disposition strategy, on May 17, 2017, we completed the sale ofour 50 percent nonoperated

interest in the FCCL Partnership, as well as themajority of our western Canada gas assetsto Cenovus Energy.

Consideration for the transaction included 208million Cenovus Energy common shares.We may not be able

to liquidate the shares issued to us by CenovusEnergy at prices we deem acceptable, or at all.






Our operations present hazards and risks thatrequire significant and continuous oversight.



The scope and nature of our operations presenta variety of significant hazards and risks, includingoperational

hazards and risks such as explosions, fires,crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes,

armed hostilities, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civilunrest or cyber attacks.Our operations may also be

adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving servicesor infrastructure required to

develop, produce, process or transport our production,such as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars,

tankers, barges or other infrastructure.Our operations are subject to the additional hazardsof pollution,

releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazardsand risks.Offshore activities may pose incrementally

greater risks because of complex subsurfaceconditions such as higher reservoir pressures,water depths and

metocean conditions.All such hazards could result in loss of humanlife, significant property and equipment

damage, environmental pollution, impairmentof operations, substantial losses to us and damage toour

reputation.Further, our business and operations may be disrupted ifwe do not respond, or are perceived not to

respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazardsand risks or any other major crisis or ifwe are

unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operationalcomponents and capacity.



Our technologies, systems and networks may be subjectto cyber attacks.



Our business, like others within the oil and gasindustry, has become increasingly dependent on digital

technologies, some of which are managed by third-partyservice providers on whom we rely tohelp us collect,

host or process information.Among other activities, we rely on digital technologyto estimate oil and gas

reserves, process and record financial and operatingdata, analyze seismic and drilling informationand

communicate with employees and third parties.As a result, we face various cyber securitythreats such as

attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or controlof, sensitive information about our operationsand our

employees, attempts to render our data or systems(or those of third parties with whom we dobusiness)

corrupted or unusable, threats to the securityof our facilities and infrastructure as wellas those of third parties

with whom we do business and attempted cyberterrorism.



In addition, computers control oil and gas production,processing equipment and distributionsystems globally

and are necessary to deliver our production to market.A disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these

operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructureon which they rely, many of which are not owned or

operated by us, could damage critical production,distribution or storage assets, delay or prevent deliveryto

markets or make it difficult or impossible to accuratelyaccount for production and settle transactions.



Although we have experienced occasional breachesof our cyber security, none of these breaches have had a

material effect on our business, operations or reputation.As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must

continually expend additional resources to continueto modify or enhance our protective measuresor to

investigate and remediate any vulnerabilitiesdetected.Our implementation of various proceduresand controls

to monitor and mitigate security threatsand to increase security for our information, facilitiesand

infrastructure may result in increased costs.Despite our ongoing investments in securityresources, talent and

business practices, we are unable to assure thatany security measures will be effective.



If our systems and infrastructure were to be breached,damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious

negative consequences, including disruption ofour operations, damage to our reputation,a loss of counterparty

trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliancecosts, significant litigation exposure and legal

liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.Any of these could materially and adversely affect our

business, results of operations or financial condition.Although we have business continuity plans inplace, our

operations may be adversely affected by significant andwidespread disruption to our systems and

infrastructure that support our business.While we continue to evolve and modify ourbusiness continuity

plans, there can be no assurance that they willbe effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.

Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensateus for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain

adequate coverage may increase for us in the future.
