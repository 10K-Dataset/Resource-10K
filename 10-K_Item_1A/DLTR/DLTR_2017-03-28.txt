Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any failure to meet market expectations, including our comparable store sales growth rate, earnings and earnings per share or new store openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline. You should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report. Any of the following risks may materialize, and additional risks not known to us, or that we now deem immaterial, may arise. In such event, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.

Our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases.

Future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefit costs, taxes, duties, merchandise loss (due to theft, damage, or errors), shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability. For example, a proposal in Congress called the border-adjustment tax would disallow the tax deduction for imported merchandise and interest. In the last fiscal year, our direct imports were $6,267.3 million at retail and our interest expense was $378.8 million. Even if the corporate tax rate were reduced, this change would increase our federal income tax and reduce our profits substantially. The minimum wage has increased in certain states and local jurisdictions and is scheduled to increase in other states and local jurisdictions. There is a possibility that Congress will increase the federal minimum wage. The Department of Labor also issued regulations last year that would have resulted in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements which would have increased our wage costs, but such rules are currently enjoined.

In our Dollar Tree segment, we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the $1.00 price point to continue to provide value to the customer. We are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment, to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation or other cost increases. We can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future. Although Family Dollar, unlike Dollar Tree, can raise the price of merchandise, customers would buy fewer products if prices were to increase. Please see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" beginning on page 27 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the effect of Inflation and Other Economic Factors on our operations.

Risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers, including, among others, increased taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, could adversely affect our financial performance.

We are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties, we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used.

We rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices. Merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 41% to 43% of our Dollar Tree segment's total retail value purchases and 15% to 17% of our Family Dollar segment's total retail value purchases. In addition, we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. China is the source of a substantial majority of our imports. Imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise, an increase in the cost of those goods or an inability to deduct the cost of such goods for tax purposes may significantly decrease our profits. Risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as:

•an increase in duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade;

•the implementation of the border-adjustment tax;

•raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest;

•economic crises and international disputes or conflicts;

•changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions, including inflation in the country of

origin; and

•failure of the United States to maintain normal trade relations with China and other countries.










Integrating Family Dollar’s operations with ours may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized.

The success of the Family Dollar acquisition (the “Acquisition”), including anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of the Family Dollar segment into our company. It is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs (including costs incurred with respect to the divested stores and related services), ongoing diversion of management attention, increased competition, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

In connection with the Acquisition, we were required to divest 330 stores and partially support those stores through a transition services agreement. We are continuing to provide certain transition services to the buyer of the divested stores with respect to which the buyer may owe us approximately $40 million at any time. Under the transition services agreement, the buyer must reimburse us for those services in the future. We can give no assurances that we will be able to collect those amounts.

A downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales.

Deterioration in economic conditions, such as those caused by a recession, inflation, higher unemployment, consumer debt levels, trade disputes or international conflict, as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism, could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably. Adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins.

A significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business.

We rely extensively on our computer and technology systems to manage inventory, process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results. Systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity, which could adversely affect our results of operation or business.

If we are unable to secure our customers’ credit card and confidential information, or other private data relating to our associates, suppliers or our business, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation, which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business.

We have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers’ debit and credit card information, our associates’ private data, suppliers’ data, and our business records and intellectual property. Despite these measures, criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent safeguards and we may be vulnerable to, and unable to detect and appropriately respond to, data security breaches and data loss, including cyber-security attacks. Other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches. If we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to negative publicity, government enforcement actions, private litigation, or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected, which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business.

Our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably.

Existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality, relevance and availability, store operations and customer satisfaction. In addition, increased competition could adversely affect our sales. Our highest sales periods are during the Christmas and Easter seasons, and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation, we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores. A reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year. Untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect. When Easter is observed earlier in the year, the selling season is shorter and, as a result, our sales could be adversely affected. Easter was observed on April 5, 2015 and March 27, 2016, and will be observed on April 16, 2017.

Expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms. Obtaining an increasing










number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge. In addition, our expansion is dependent upon third-party developers’ abilities to acquire land, obtain financing, and secure necessary permits and approvals. It remains difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets. We also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores. We may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise.

Our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. We also rely on third parties to deliver certain merchandise directly from vendors to our stores. We may not anticipate, respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems. Additionally, if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs. Some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are:

•Shipping disruption.Our oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time to time.

•Shipping costs. We could experience increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans-Pacific ocean carriers. Changes in import duties, import quotas and other trade sanctions could increase our costs.

•Efficient Operations.Distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate

efficiently and we could experience a reduction in operating efficiency.

•Diesel fuel costs.We have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years.

•Vulnerability to natural or man-made disasters.A fire, explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution

facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores. Some facilities are

vulnerable to earthquakes, hurricanes or tornadoes.

•Labor disagreement.Labor disagreements, disruptions or strikes may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise

to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs.

•War, terrorism and other events.War and acts of terrorism in the United States, the Middle East, or in China or other

parts of Asia, where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise, could disrupt our supply chain or

increase our transportation costs.

•Economic conditions.Suppliers may encounter financial or other difficulties.

Our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell.

Our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future. Imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods. If the proposed border-adjustment tax or a possible increase in duties increases the cost of imported goods, we may sell less imported goods and our profitability may suffer. In recent years, the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue. As a result, our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage. We can give no assurance that we will be able to do so.

In our Family Dollar segment, our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices. A sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at Family Dollar could suffer. We are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at Family Dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability. Inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at Family Dollar could have a negative effect on our business.

In addition, our Family Dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing. We believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including our pricing, costs, quality and customer perception. We may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and, as a result, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Additionally, the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our non-private brand suppliers.










Pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits.

The retail industry is highly competitive. The marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies. We expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. Some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Please see "Item 1. Business" beginning on page 6 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.

Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For a discussion of current legal matters, please see "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" beginning on page 22 of this Form 10-K and "Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies" under the caption "Contingencies" in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" beginning on page 64 of this Form 10-K. Resolution of these matters, if decided against the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, accrued liabilities or cash flows.

Changes in federal, state or local law, or our failure to comply with such laws, could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks.

Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel.

Our growth and performance is dependent on the skills, experience and contributions of our associates, executives and key personnel. Various factors, including our recent merger, overall labor availability, wage rates, regulatory or legislative impacts, and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices.










Certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest.

Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest. These provisions, among other things:

•provide that only the Board of Directors, chairman or president may call special meetings of the shareholders;

•establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder

proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings; and

•permit the Board of Directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock,

which may have rights senior to those of the common stock.

However, we believe that these provisions allow our Board of Directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.

In connection with the Acquisition, we substantially increased our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position. As ofJanuary 28, 2017, our total indebtedness is $6,391.8 million. In addition, we have$1,250.0 millionof additional borrowing availability under our Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility, less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling $160.7 million.

Our high level of debt could have significant consequences, including the following:

•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or

other general corporate purposes;

•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments, instead of other purposes,

thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;

•imposing restrictive covenants on our operations;

•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt; and

•making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures.

In addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements that govern our indebtedness restrict (a) our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and (b) our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.










Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations.

If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, holders of the notes (and lenders under any of our existing and future indebtedness) could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, in each case, which could result in your losing your investment.

The terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies, and could adversely affect our capital resources, financial condition and liquidity.

The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:

•incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;

•declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for

value, equity interests;

•make principal payments on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt;

•make loans, advances or other investments;

•incur liens;

•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;

•enter into sale and lease-back transactions;

•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; and

•enter into transactions with affiliates.

In addition, certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.

A breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates. Such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. In addition, an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities, those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.

As a result of these restrictions, we may be:

•limited in how we conduct our business;

•unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or

•unable to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans.










Our variable-rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Certain of our indebtedness, including borrowings under our Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility, is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk. Interest rates, while historically low, have recently begun to increase. When interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income decreases. An increase (decrease) of 1.0% on the interest rate would result in an increase (decrease) of $21.8 million in annual interest expense. Although we may enter into interest rate swaps, involving the exchange of floating- for fixed-rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you we will be able to do so.
