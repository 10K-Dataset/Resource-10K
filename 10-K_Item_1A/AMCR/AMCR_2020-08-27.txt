Item 1A. - Risk Factors



The following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or, that we presently believe are not material, could also affect our business operations and financial results.



Strategic Risks



Changes in Consumer Demand — We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries.



Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand. Furthermore, any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner.



Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.



Key Customers and Customer Consolidation — The loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability.



Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers. From time to time, a single customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10% or more of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal periods.



Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit.



There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, change to alternative forms of packaging, begin manufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before.



Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.



In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



Competition — We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business.



We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures and competitive behavior. We regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which






we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand. We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness.



The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. In addition, our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers. No assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.



Expanding Our Current Business — We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including product innovation, or acquisitions.



Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets, product innovation, and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control. Our ability to grow organically may be limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic priorities or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences. Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.



Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Bemis in 2019. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. Other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us, resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets. Due in part to that competition, as well as the recent low interest rate environment, which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible, price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages. If, as a result of these and other factors, we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting

expected financial benefits.



Integration — We may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition.



We may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures. In addition, the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations.



We generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions. For example, we expect the Bemis acquisition in 2019 will generate estimated pre-tax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately $180 million from procurement, manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies. While we are currently on track to achieve the targeted Bemis synergies, we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained. If we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected synergy cost savings, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so.



Intellectual Property — Challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.



Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. We own a number of patents on our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and we own, or have licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. Furthermore, many of








Operational Risks



Global Health Outbreaks — Our business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak or other similar outbreaks.



Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. We have also impaired an equity method investment by $25.6 million in the fourth quarter, in part, partially due to general market declines associated with the pandemic. See Note 7, "Equity Method Investments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment.



The outbreak has in the past, and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities, the facilities of our suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. In limited cases to date, certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities, which has impacted their demand, and we may continue to experience the volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns. In addition, the coronavirus has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn, such as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, business shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations, including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates, is unknown and the effect could be material.



Global Operations — Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.



Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, agribusiness, industrial, and other consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The current global economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies.



When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers, which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and result in a loss of business. Weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.








Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate. For example, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union has resulted in uncertainty regarding the long-term nature of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union, causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of market participants. Political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees, and adversely impact profitability.



International Operations — Our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.



We have operations throughout the world, including facilities located in emerging markets. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 74% of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 26% came from emerging markets. We expect to continue to expand our operations in the future, particularly in the emerging markets.



Management of global operations is extremely complex, particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural, political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil, China and India and other emerging markets, have underdeveloped or developing legal, regulatory or political systems, which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest.



The profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things:



•changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes;

•changes in, or difficulties in interpreting and complying with, local laws and regulations, including tax, labor, foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws;

•nullification, modification or renegotiation of, or difficulties or delays in enforcing, contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law;

•reversal of current political, judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade, or relating to the use of local agents, representatives or partners in the relevant jurisdictions;

•pandemics, such as COVID-19, impacting various regions of the world unequally; or

•changes in exchange rates and inflation, including hyperinflation, which may be further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.



Further, sustained periods of legal, regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.



The international scope of our operations, which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations (collectively, ‘‘Sanctions’’), and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to Sanctions, also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures. Failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations, including those relating to money laundering, corruption, export control, fraud, bribery, insider trading, antitrust, competition and economic sanctions, whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise. Any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business, which effect may be material.



Raw Materials — Price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business.



As a manufacturer of packaging products, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs, including energy. All of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films, inks and solvents, aluminum and fiber-based carton board. Prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), currency and commodity price fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw






material costs, there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements, there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.



Commercial Risks — We are subject to production, supply and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic downturn.



We face a number of commercial risks, including (i) operational disruption, such as mechanical or technology failures or forced closures due to pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), each of which could, in turn, lead to production loss and/or increased costs, (ii) shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and (iii) risks associated with development projects (such as cost overruns and delays). In addition, many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, snowstorms, hurricanes, forest fires and flooding. Any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime.



Supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to the COVID-19 pandemic or other natural disasters, could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials, equipment and other supplies, and in turn, adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution or other business activities.



Additionally, the insolvency of, or contractual default by, any of our customers, suppliers and financial institutions, such as banks and insurance providers, may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility (such as economic volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate. If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us, we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off. If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project, we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that party’s obligations or, alternatively, fulfill those obligations ourself, which is likely to be more expensive. The occurrence of any of these risks, including any default by our counterparties, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage.



Information technology — A failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, vendor and other data and could negatively affect our business.



We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions, and on various technologies to process, store and report information about our business, and to interact with customers, vendors and employees around the world. In addition, our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures. These measures cover technical changes to our network security, organization and governance changes as well as alignment of third party vendors on market standards. As with all large systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruption, information loss or shutdown due to power outages, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality.



We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, misplaced or lost data and programming and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information. Information system damages, disruptions, shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of customers and business opportunities, violation of privacy laws and legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, negative publicity resulting in reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results






of operations, which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats.



Attracting and retaining key personnel — If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may be adversely affected.



Our continued success depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel in key functions and geographic areas. Losing the services of key employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our objectives. There can be no assurance we will be able to recruit, train, assimilate, motivate and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture.



Operational hazards — We are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.



We are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws, rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business. Many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products. Compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources.



In addition, changes to such laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials. Additionally, increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change, including greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance.



Federal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations. We may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own, used or operate (including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future). Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that require substantial, and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditure.



The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business. A number of governmental bodies have introduced, or are contemplating introducing, regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change, which, where implemented, may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results.



We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs relating to the damage of natural resources, lost property values and toxic tort claims. Provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of potential environmental damage, and the extent of our liability for such damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount. Accordingly, additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position, which may be material.



Labor disputes — We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which could adversely affect our business.



Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future, including protests and strikes, which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future.








Financial Risks



LIBOR Indexed Borrowings — The expected phase out of LIBOR could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase.



A substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.



Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Exchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.



We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional and translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance. Transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and other currencies, including in Latin America, in which our costs are denominated, which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales. Translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to U.S. dollars, consistent with our reporting currency, and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses. In particular, our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement.



Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly. For instance, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have weighed on the Mexican and Brazilian economies, respectively. In addition, we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting.



To the extent currency devaluation continues across our business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-denominated input costs across our business, which would adversely impact our margins and profitability. As such, we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.



Interest rates — An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.



Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Refer to Note 13, "Debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and interest rates.



Credit rating — A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.



In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper, drawdown bank loans and issue long-term bonds to meet our funding needs. Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on many factors, including our financial results, their view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook for the global economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade. If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, or place us on a watch list, the impacts could include reduced access to the commercial paper market, an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets.






Refer to "Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," for more information on our credit rating profile.



Hedging — Failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.



We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floating-rate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates. The level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any time. If our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks, if we are under-hedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.



Goodwill and other intangible assets — A significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth.



As of June 30, 2020, we had $7.3 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill and/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate. See "Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Internal Controls — If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.



As a newly listed NYSE public company in 2019, we elected the transition period for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, during our transition period, we were exempt from Section 404 compliance until we filed our second Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 (which is this Annual Report on Form 10-K).



Amcor Limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in Australia including the preparation of its financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards ("AAS")  as adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and other relevant companies law. Amcor Limited was not required to comply with U.S. GAAP. Following the consummation of the Bemis acquisition, we now prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. We have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020, see "Item 9A, Controls and Procedures," for further information.



We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information.








We are currently in the process of remediating the second material weakness through a process to (i) develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems, which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical, (ii) design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and (iii) develop training on segregation of duties. Given that we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021. We believe that these enhanced resources and processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the second material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively.



Failure to remediate the material weakness described above at all or within our expected timeframe, or any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.



Insurance — Our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face.



We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance. A significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with third-party re-insurers. Our policies with such third-party re-insurers cover property damage and business interruption, public and products liability and directors' and officers' liability. Although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice, they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid.



Additionally, we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company, Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd, which is located in Singapore. Our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups, and assumes specific risks relating to property damage, business interruption and liability claims. The captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captive's reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.



Legal and Compliance Risks



Litigation — Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.



We are, and in the future will likely become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Given our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Refer to "Item 3. - Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Environmental, health, and safety regulations — Changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters may adversely affect our company.



Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about Greenhouse Gas emissions and climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost, as well as energy and freight costs. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging, both highly regulated markets. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.



Patents and proprietary technology — Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop, acquire and retain intellectual property rights.



Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our






proprietary rights. If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may suffer. Our pending patent applications, and our pending trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks. In addition, our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. Competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.



Risks Relating to Being a Jersey, Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares



Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a U.S. jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other U.S. corporations.



We are organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy, France. Jersey is not a member of the European Union. Jersey, Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law principles. The rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by Jersey law, including the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and by the Amcor Articles of Association, as may be amended from time to time. These rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands, will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the U.S., which could adversely affect the rights of investors.



U.S. shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us.



A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the United States upon those non-U.S. directors and officers, or to enforce judgments realized in the United States.



Judgments of U.S. courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the U.S. and the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts outside of the U.S., including those in Australia and Jersey, may be subject to limitations. Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the U.S., including Australia and Jersey, for liabilities under the securities laws of the U.S. Additionally, our Articles of Association provide that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us, the Royal Court of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions, actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers, actions arising out of Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws from being raised in a U.S. court and would not prevent a U.S. court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims. However, there is uncertainty whether a U.S. or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims.
