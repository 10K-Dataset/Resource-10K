ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2011. These statements use such words as
“may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe” and “plan.” They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying
assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements.

Our business and execution of
our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating
environment. The IEO segment of the restaurant industry, although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of
our major markets, and this may continue. The current environment, including persistently high unemployment rates in many of our markets, has also increased consumer focus on value and heightened pricing pressures across the industry. Combined with
increasing pressure on commodity and labor costs, these circumstances could affect our ability to continue to grow comparable sales and margins despite the strength of our brand and value proposition. We have the added challenge of the cultural,
economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Our operations, plans and results are also affected by regulatory and similar initiatives around the world, as well as by

the focus on nutritional content and the production, processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter.”

The risks we face can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that we believe
are most likely to affect our performance.

Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on how well we
execute the Plan to Win.

The Plan to Win addresses the key drivers of our business and results—people, products, place,
price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

•

Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we
serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about us, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to enter into
site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us;

•

Our ability to drive restaurant improvements and to motivate our restaurant personnel to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer
perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments;

•

Whether our restaurant reimaging and rebuilding efforts, which remain a priority notwithstanding the current challenging economic and operating environment, are
targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals to enhance the relevance of our brand and achieve an efficient allocation of our capital resources;

•

The risks associated with our franchise business model, including whether our franchisees and developmental licensees will have the experience and financial
resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives and the potential impact on us if they experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image
inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by local law or otherwise, costly to exercise or subject to litigation;

•

The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social
responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence;

•

Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment or about our products, promotions and premiums,
such as Happy Meals (collectively, our products), or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of our products, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald’s of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues;

•

The success of our plans to improve existing menu items and to roll out new menu items, as well as the impact of our competitors’ actions, including in
response to our menu changes and product introductions, and our ability to continue robust menu development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations;



•

Our ability to differentiate the McDonald’s experience in a way that balances consumer value with margin expansion, particularly in markets where pricing or
cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by the current challenging economic and operating environment;

•

The impact of pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to changing economic
conditions;

•

The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can
adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonald’s System and whose performance has a material impact on our results;

•

Our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth in certain developing markets;

•

Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way; and

•

The costs and operational risks associated with our increasing reliance on information technology (including our point-of-sale and other in-store technology
systems or platforms), such as the need for increasing investments to upgrade and maintain our systems, the potential for system failures or programming errors and the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments becomes more widespread.

Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales,
margins and net income.

Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by
local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other
actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact.
The current environment has been characterized by weak economies, persistently high unemployment rates and continuing uncertainty in financial and credit markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer confidence and spending.
Moreover, the strength of the current recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that can affect our operations, plans and results
in this environment are the following:

•

Whether our strategies will permit us to compete effectively and make continued market share gains despite the uncertain economic outlook, while at the same time
achieving sales and operating income within our targeted long-term average annual range of growth;

•

The effectiveness of our supply chain management, including hedging strategies, to assure reliable and sufficient product supply on favorable terms;

•

The impact of foreign exchange and interest rates, as well as governmental actions to manage national economic matters, including austerity initiatives, credit
availability, unemployment and taxation rates, all of which can also affect relative levels of disposable income and discretionary expenditures, such as food away from home;

•

The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets
and any potential impact of union organizing efforts;

•

Whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants from year to year, and whether
new sites are as profitable as expected;

•

The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, such as China and Russia, which may entail a relatively higher risk of
political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced,
including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; and

•

The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings.

Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.

Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and
results in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and
untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:

•

The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, especially in the United States where
inconsistent standards imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, and the impact of new, potential
or changing regulation that affects or restricts elements of our business, particularly those relating to marketing to children, nutritional content and product labeling and safety;

•

The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but
nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business;

•

The risks and costs of McDonald’s nutritional labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements
and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and



the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information obtained from third party suppliers;

•

The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities and non-governmental
organizations on environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption, including as a result of initiatives that effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions;

•

The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor and employment claims and landlord/tenant disputes; the
relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; and the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures
or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;

•

Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our
marketing or other communication practices;

•

The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations
relating to wage and hour practices, immigration, mandatory healthcare benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination;

•

The impact of the current economic conditions on unemployment levels and consumer confidence and the effect of initiatives to stimulate economic recovery and to
further regulate financial markets on the cost and availability of funding for the Company and its franchisees, inflation and foreign exchange rates;

•

Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export
controls, increased tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors’ operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit;

•

The legal and compliance risks associated with information technology, such as the costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the
potential costs associated with alleged security breaches (including the loss of consumer confidence that may result and the risk of criminal penalties or civil liability to consumers or employees whose data is alleged to have been collected or used
inappropriately) and potential challenges to the associated intellectual property rights; and

•

The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates,
changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or authoritative interpretations relating to any of these matters), and the impact of settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax
audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope.

The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.

Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these,
some of which are outside our control, are the following:

•

The continuing uncertain global economic and market conditions;

•

Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the
United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;

•

Changes in financial or tax reporting and accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results and investor
perceptions of our performance;

•

Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can reflect market
commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases) or expectations about our business, our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business
strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald’s may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average;

•

The impact of our stock repurchase program, dividend rate or changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, ability to obtain funding on
favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants; and

•

The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in
light of business, legal and tax considerations.

Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the
impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.

Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities,
health epidemics or pandemics, or expectations about them, can have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any
insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
