ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2010. These statements use such words as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe”
and “plan.” They reflect our expectations and speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update them. Our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on
forward-looking statements.

Our business and execution of our strategic plan, the Plan to Win, are subject to risks. The most important
of these is our ability to remain relevant to our customers and a brand they trust. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our operating environment. The informal eating out (IEO) segment of the restaurant industry,
although largely mature in our major markets, is highly fragmented and competitive. The current economic environment has caused the IEO segment to contract in many markets, including some of our major markets, and this may continue. The current
economic environment has increased consumer focus on value, heightening pricing pressures across the industry, which could affect our ability to continue to grow sales despite the strength of our Brand and value proposition. We have the added
challenge of the cultural, economic and regulatory differences that exist among the more than 100 countries where we operate. Regulatory and similar initiatives around the world have also become more wide-ranging and prescriptive and affect how we
operate and our results. In

particular, increasing focus on nutritional content and on the production, processing and preparation of food “from field to front counter” presents challenges for our Brand.

The risks we face can have an impact both in the near- and long-term and are reflected in the following considerations and factors that
we believe are most likely to affect our performance.

Our ability to remain a relevant and trusted brand and to increase sales depends largely on
how well we execute the Plan to Win, particularly as the global economy emerges from recession.

The Plan to Win addresses the key
drivers of our business and results—people, products, place, price and promotion. The quality of our execution depends mainly on the following:

•

Our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to trends or other factors that affect the IEO segment and our competitive position in the diverse markets we
serve, such as spending patterns, demographic changes, trends in food preparation, consumer preferences and publicity about our products, all of which can drive popular perceptions of our business or affect the willingness of other companies to
enter into site, supply or other arrangements or alliances with us;

•

The success of our initiatives to support menu choice, physical activity and nutritional awareness and to address these and other matters of social
responsibility in a way that communicates our values effectively and inspires trust and confidence;

•

Our ability to respond effectively to adverse perceptions about the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our products and promotions (including the
premiums we offer, such as our Happy Meal toys) or the reliability of our supply chain and the safety of the ingredients we use, and our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald’s of food-borne illnesses or product safety issues;

•

The success of our plans to improve existing products and to roll out new products and product line extensions, as well as the impact of our competitors’
actions, including in response to our product improvements and introductions, and our ability to continue robust product development and manage the complexity of our restaurant operations;

•

Our ability to achieve an overall product mix that differentiates the McDonald’s experience and balances consumer value with margin expansion, particularly
in markets where pricing or cost pressures are significant or have been exacerbated by challenging economic conditions;

•

The impact of our pricing, marketing and promotional plans on sales and margins and our ability to adjust our plans to respond quickly to changing economic
conditions;

•

The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) that can
adversely affect us directly or adversely affect the vendors, franchisees and others that are also part of the McDonald’s System and whose performance has a material impact on our results;

•

Our ability to recruit and retain qualified local personnel to manage our operations and growth in certain developing markets;



•

Our ability to drive restaurant improvements and to motivate our restaurant personnel to achieve sustained high service levels so as to improve consumer
perceptions of our ability to meet expectations for quality food served in clean and friendly environments;

•

Whether our restaurant remodeling and rebuilding efforts, which remain a priority notwithstanding the current period of slow economic growth and challenging
credit markets, are targeted at the elements of the restaurant experience that will best accomplish our goals to enhance the relevance of our Brand and achieve an efficient allocation of our capital resources;

•

Our ability to maintain alignment with franchisees on operating, promotional and capital-intensive initiatives;

•

The risks to our Brand if a franchisee defaults in its obligations (particularly requirements to pay royalties, make capital investments and open new
restaurants), experiences food safety or other operational problems or projects a brand image inconsistent with our values, all of which are more significant risks if a franchisee controls a large number of restaurants as is the case in Latin
America; and

•

Our ability to leverage promotional or operating successes in individual markets into other markets in a timely and cost-effective way.

Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which can adversely affect our sales,
margins and net income.

Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions, but also by
local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or daypart (e.g., breakfast). To mitigate the impact of these conditions, we may take promotional or other
actions that adversely affect our margins, limit our operating flexibility or result in charges, restaurant closings or sales of Company-operated restaurants. Some macroeconomic conditions could have an even more wide-ranging and prolonged impact.
The current environment has been characterized by slowing economies, rising unemployment, declining wages, constrained credit and volatile financial markets. These conditions have significantly affected consumer spending and habits. Moreover, the
timing and strength of a recovery is uncertain in many of our most important markets, and growth in consumer spending generally lags improvement in the broader economy. The key factors that affect our ability to manage the impact of these conditions
are the following:

•

Whether our strategies will permit us to compete effectively and make continued market share gains, while at the same time achieving sales and operating income
within our targeted long-term average annual range of growth;

•

The effectiveness of our supply chain management, including hedging strategies, to preserve and, where possible, expand our margins;

•

Our ability to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates and governmental actions to manage national economic
conditions such as credit availability, consumer spending, unemployment levels and inflation rates;

•

The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets
and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our restaurants;

•

Whether we are able to identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants from year to year, and whether
new sites are as profitable as expected;

•

The challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, such as China, Russia and India, which may entail a relatively higher risk of
political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest, all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced,
including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment; and

•

The nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment charges that reduce our earnings.

Increasing regulatory complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.

Our legal and regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that affect our operations and results
in material ways. In many of our markets, including the United States and Europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws
and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory and litigation risks we face and must manage are the following:

•

The cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting regulations we face, especially in the United States where inconsistent standards
imposed by local, state and federal authorities can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings, and the impact of new, potential or changing regulation
that affects or restricts elements of our business, particularly those relating to advertising to children, nutritional content and product labeling and safety;

•

The impact of nutritional, health and other scientific inquiries and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, but
nonetheless drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation, including taxation, in ways that could be material to our business;

•

The risks and costs of McDonald’s nutritional labeling and other disclosure practices, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements
and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information obtained from third party
suppliers;

•

The risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters, such
as climate change, the



reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption, including as a result of initiatives that effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions, such as the proposed “cap and trade”
legislation pending in the U.S. Congress;

•

The impact of litigation trends, particularly in our major markets, including class actions, labor and employment claims and landlord/tenant disputes; the
relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; and the cost and other effects of settlements or judgments, which may require us to make disclosures
or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our Brand and products;

•

Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our
advertising or other communications;

•

The increasing costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and overseas regulations affecting our workforce and labor practices, including regulations
relating to wage and hour practices, immigration, mandatory healthcare benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination;

•

The impact of the current economic conditions on unemployment levels and consumer confidence and the effect of initiatives to stimulate economic recovery and to
further regulate financial markets (including through changes in taxation) on the cost and availability of funding for the Company and its franchisees, inflation and foreign exchange rates;

•

Disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, such as price or import- export controls, increased
tariffs or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors’ operations, and the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or proceedings, whether or not they have merit;

•

The risks associated with information security and the use of cashless payments, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with
privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments increases, the potential costs associated with alleged security breaches and the loss of consumer confidence that may result; and

•

The impact of changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, related legal or regulatory interpretations or our critical
accounting estimates, changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or interpretations thereof), and the impact of settlements of adjustments proposed by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of
which will depend on their timing, nature and scope.

The trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many
factors.

Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The
most important of these, some of which are outside our control, are the following:

•

The current uncertain global economic conditions and market volatility;

•

Governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence

financial markets, particularly in the United States which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the
matter in question does not directly relate to our business;

•

Trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can reflect market
commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete in some cases) or expectations about our business, our creditworthiness or investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business
strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald’s may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average;

•

The impact of our stock repurchase program, dividend rate or changes in our debt levels on our credit ratings, interest expense, ability to obtain funding on
favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants; and

•

The impact on our results of other corporate actions, such as those we may take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure in
light of business, legal and tax considerations.

Our results and financial condition are affected by our ownership mix.

Our refranchising strategy involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants. The decision to own restaurants or
to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. When we refranchise a restaurant, it reduces consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where
we receive rent and/or royalties. It also reduces Company-operated margin dollars while increasing franchised margin dollars, with the impact on margin percentages varying based on sales and operating costs of the refranchised restaurants. Our
refranchising strategy can also expose us to risks, including the following:

•

Whether the franchisees we select will have the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets to be effective operators of McDonald’s
restaurants;

•

Potential ongoing payment obligations as a result of our retention of any contingent liabilities in connection with refranchising transactions, such as the
indemnification obligations we may incur as a result of the Latam transaction; and

•

The risk that our contractual and other rights and remedies to protect against defaults by our counterparties will be limited by local law, costly to exercise or
otherwise subject to limitations or litigation that may impair our ability to prevent or mitigate any adverse impact on our Brand or on the financial performance we expect under our franchising and developmental license agreements.



Our results can be adversely affected by disruptions or events, such as the impact of severe weather conditions and natural disasters.

Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can have an
adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels or on other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be
delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
