ITEM 1A- RISK FACTORS



An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings before you decide whether to buy our common stock. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.  If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.



Failure to safeguard our data could affect our reputation among our merchant clients and cardholders, and may expose us to penalties, fines, liabilities and legal claims.



Under VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover card network rules, and various state laws, we are responsible for information provided to us by merchants, ISO's, third-party service providers, and other agents (all of which we refer to as “associated third parties”), which we require in order to process transactions and for fraud prevention.  This information includes bankcard numbers, names, addresses, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, and bank account numbers.  We process the data and deliver our products and services by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third-party service providers.  We have ultimate liability to the card networks and their member financial institutions for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties to protect this information.  Although plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data, we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats designed to breach our systems in order to gain access to confidential information.  Our computer systems have been, and could be in the future, subject to penetration and our data protection procedures may not prevent unauthorized use. We could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws.



Although we generally require that our agreements with service providers who have access to merchant and customer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any customer or merchant data except in accordance with the applicable agreements, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data. In addition, we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data. The costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability and protracted and costly litigation.



In early March of 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system. Our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services. The merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the U.S. We cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported; however, we notified potentially-affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals.



As a result of this event, certain card networks removed us from their list of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI DSS") compliant service providers. Our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete. We hired a QSA to conduct an independent review of the PCI DSS compliance of our systems.  Global Payments Direct, Inc, our primary operating entity, has been returned to the list of PCI DSS compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process, store, transmit or otherwise utilize card data. To date, we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event. However, this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues.



During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013, we recorded$36.8 millionof expense associated with this incident, bringing the life-to-date total expense to$121.2 million.  Of this amount, $105.5 million represents the costs we have incurred through May 31, 2013 for legal fees, fees of consultants and other professional advisors engaged to conduct the investigation and various other costs associated with the investigation and remediation.  An additional$35.7 millionrepresents total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. We also recorded$20.0 millionof insurance recoveries. During fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by$31.8 million. We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. The primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected.













A security breach like the one that recently occurred, or other misuse of data could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our products and services, increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the breach, expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability, disrupt our operations (including potential service interruptions), increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state, federal and foreign laws or by the card networks, and adversely affect our continued card network registration and financial institution sponsorship.



We have insurance that we believe would provide coverage of costs associated with a security incident. However, there can be no assurance that such costs would not materially exceed such insurance coverage.



Our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept Visa cards and MasterCard cards are dependent upon our continued Visa and MasterCard registration and financial institution sponsorship and, in some cases, continued participation in certain card networks.





In Canada, we have filed an application with the Canadian regulatory authorities for the formation of a wholly owned loan company in Canada which could serve as our financial institution sponsor. While such application is pending, in March 2011, we obtained temporary direct participation in the Visa Canada system.  This temporary status currently expires on October 30, 2013.  In the event the wholly owned loan company has not been approved by such expiration date and Visa is unwilling to extend such temporary status, we have entered into an agreement with a financial institution that is willing to serve as our sponsor; however that agreement is not intended to be a long-term solution.



We rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement, our business may be adversely affected.



We rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services, we must find other financial institutions to provide those services. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively impact our revenue and earnings.



If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations.  If our merchants or ISOs incur fines or penalties that we cannot collect from them, we could end up bearing the cost of such fines or penalties.













registration, could require us to stop providing Visa and MasterCard payment processing services, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.

Increased merchant, referral partner or ISO attrition could cause our financial results to decline.

We experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors, including business closures, transfers of merchants' accounts to our competitors, unsuccessful contract renewal renegotiation, and account closures that we initiate for various reasons, such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants. Our ISO sales channel is a strong contributor to our revenue growth in our North America merchant services segment. If an ISO partner switches to another transaction processor, terminates our services, shuts down or becomes insolvent, we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the ISO, and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the ISO. We cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase.  Our referral partners are an important source of new business.   Higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The payment processing industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do, which may give them an advantage in our market with respect to the pricing of our products and services offered to our customers, and our ability to develop new technologies.



We operate in the electronic payments market, which is highly competitive.  Our primary competitors in these markets include other independent processors, as well as financial institutions, ISOs, and, potentially, card networks. Many of our competitors are companies that are larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources than we have. In addition, our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank for registration with the card networks. These factors may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers, which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well.  Higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



In addition, many of our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies and services, including Internet payment processing services and mobile payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings.  If successful, their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers, again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings.



Additionally, our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur costs associated with being sponsored by a direct participant for registration with the card networks and can settle transactions more quickly for their merchants than we can for ours. This may allow our competitors to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective merchants, or other products or services that we do not offer. This could result in a loss of customers, greater difficulty attracting new customers, and a reduction in the price we can charge for our services.



Furthermore, we are facing competition from non-traditional competitors, such as Paypal and Google, who offer alternative payment methods. These non-traditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. If these non-traditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.



In order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings, we must continually update our products and services, a process which could result in increased costs and the loss of revenues, earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace.



The electronic payments markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological changes. These markets are characterized by technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs.  In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of a new front-end platform for electronic payments processing, mobile payment applications, e-commerce services and other new offerings emerging in the electronic payments industry.  These projects carry the risks associated with any development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems.  In the electronic payments markets these risks are even more acute.  Any delay in the delivery of new products or services or the failure to differentiate our products and services could render them less desirable to our customers, or possibly even obsolete.  In addition, the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. As a result of these factors, our











development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenue and earnings if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers or do not perform as anticipated. We also rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. Furthermore, our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies and services, including e-commerce and mobile payment processing services, that provide improved operating functionality and features to their existing service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our services less desirable to clients, resulting in the loss of clients or a reduction in the fees we could generate from our offerings.



Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  For example, beginning in 2013 both MasterCard and Visa are requiring processors in the United States to support Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (“EMV”) credit and debit card authentication. Developing and implementing support for EMV requires us to invest significant resources and there is no certainty as to when, or even if, our merchants or financial institution customers will use or accept EMV.



In order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability, we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments markets and also expand into new markets.



Our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate, the further expansion of these markets, the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing, and our ability to penetrate these markets. As part of our strategy to achieve this expansion, we look for acquisition opportunities, investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities.  We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition, investment and alliance candidates in the future, and if we do, they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated.  Once completed, investments and alliances may not realize the value that we expect.



Our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market.  We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets.  If we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments markets, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.



There may be a decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general.



If consumers do not continue to use credit or debit cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash, credit cards, and debit cards, which is adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We believe future growth in the use of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use, and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses.  In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to use electronic payment methods that we process including credit and debit cards.



Our systems and our third-party providers' systems may fail which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business, increase our costs and expose us to liability.



We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems, software, data centers and telecommunications networks, as well as the systems and services of third parties. In addition, we have undertaken the relocation of our primary data center.  We have entered into agreements related to this relocation and for the ongoing management of the data center.



A system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss, but we may also be liable to third parties. Our systems and operations or those of our third-party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist acts, war, unauthorized entry, human error, and computer viruses or other defects.  Defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures, or other difficulties (including those related to the system relocation) could result in loss of revenue, loss of customers, loss of merchant and cardholder data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud











losses or other liabilities, negative publicity, additional operating and development costs, fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks, and/or diversion of technical and other resources.



We may experience software defects, undetected errors, and development delays, which could damage customer relations, decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability.



Our products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses, or defects.  Defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation, or exposure to liability claims.



In addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We incur chargeback liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers.  We cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.



In the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally “charged back” to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder.  If we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant's account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the merchant refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder.  The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment.  We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future.  Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have policies to manage merchant-related credit risk and often mitigate such risk by establishing reserve accounts, requesting collateral and establishing caps for monthly processing. Notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Fraud by merchants or others could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.



We have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others.  Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit or debit card, card number, or other credentials to record a false sales or credit transaction, processes an invalid card, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback liability or cause us to incur other liabilities.  It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future.  Increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.



We are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The global electronic payments industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits. If our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using electronic payments or people spend less money per transaction, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in lower revenue.

A downturn in the economy could force retailers to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines. Furthermore, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and be more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards. We also have a certain amount of fixed and other costs, including rent, debt service, processing contractual minimums and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy. Changes in economic conditions could also adversely impact our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.











In addition, a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings, resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us. Our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder. Our associated third parties are also liable for any fines, or penalties, that may be assessed by any card networks. In the event that we are not able to collect such amounts from the associated third parties, due to fraud, breach of contract, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such charges.



Reject losses arise from the fact that, in most markets, we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period. This results in the build-up of a substantial receivable from our customers. If a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period, we may be unable to collect such fees, which negatively impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Increases in credit card network fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings.



From time-to-time, the card networks, including Visa and MasterCard, increase the fees  that they charge processors such as us.  We could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers, but this strategy might result in the loss of those customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases.  If competitive practices prevent our passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby reducing our net revenues, increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings.



Any new or changes made to laws, regulations, card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results.



Our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect our industry in the countries in which we operate.  Regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years.  Failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.  For example, we are subject to the card network rules of Visa, MasterCard, and other card networks,  Interac, and various debit networks; applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card networks;  the Payment Services Directive in Europe; The Code of Conduct for the Credit and Debit Card Industry in Canada (issued by Canada's Department of Finance); Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 in the United States, which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities, along with a myriad of consumer protection laws and escheat regulations.  We are also subject to examination by the FFIEC (as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions).



Interchange fees (which are typically paid by the acquirer to the issuer in connection with transactions) are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory, and legislative scrutiny worldwide. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law in July 2010, significantly changes the U.S. financial regulatory system. Changes affecting the payment processing industry include restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods.  On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board adopted the final rules implementing the debit interchange fee and routing and exclusivity provisions in Dodd-Frank. The overall impact of Dodd-Frank on us is difficult to estimate because it will take some time for the market to react and adjust to the new regulations. These decisions and regulatory actions, even if not directed at us, may require significant efforts to change our systems and products and may require changes to how we price our services to customers. Until final decisions around implementation are announced, we cannot predict the impact of any of these changes on our operations and financial condition.



Changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on our business.  In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation. Furthermore, we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business. Changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive, the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.



The costs and effects of pending and future litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, financial position and results of operations.



We are from time-to-time involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted











against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Risks associated with foreign operations and investments outside the United States could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.



We are subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenue and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results.  For example, for fiscal year 2013, currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $20.3 million and our earnings by $0.05 per diluted share.  We historically have not used forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange risk.



We also have indirect foreign investments, which are subject to country risk (such as sovereign, economic, political, and location risks).  These investments are short-term in nature and with private sector issuers.  Country risk could impact the valuation and liquidity of those investments.



In addition, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currency into United States dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions.  The occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business.



We conduct a portion of our business in various European and Asia-Pacific countries, including the Russian Federation, where the risk of continued political, economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the United States.



We expect to continue to expand our operations into various countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.  Some of these countries, and other foreign countries in which we operate, such as the Russian Federation and Spain, have undergone significant political, economic and social change in recent years, and the risk of new, unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the United States.  In particular, changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations.



Transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries.  Although these regulations have not had a material impact on us to date, changes in these regulations, including taxation or limitations on transfers of data between countries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations.



The integration and conversion of our acquired operations, or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process.



The acquisition, integration, and conversion of businesses involves a number of risks.  Core risks are in the area of valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence) and integration and conversion (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company's people, products, technology, and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition). In addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example: managing geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities; integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; complying with foreign regulatory requirements; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries; difficulty entering new foreign markets due to, among other things, customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets; and general economic and political conditions.



If the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly, the following factors, among others, could reduce our revenues and earnings, increase our operating costs, and result in a loss of projected synergies:













•If we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans, duties and responsibilities, and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business, we could lose employees to our competitors in the region, which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration;

•If the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services, or the quality of those services, we could lose customers to our competitors, which would reduce our revenues and earnings; and

•The acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets.



If we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.



All of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic, and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. To successfully compete and grow, we must  recruit, develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs. In addition, we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could negatively affect our profitability. We cannot assure that key personnel, including executive officers, will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



As a result of our acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets (including goodwill).  Goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, together accounted for approximately 46.2% and 37.8% of the total assets on our balance sheet as of May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012, respectively.  We may not realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill.  We expect to engage in additional acquisitions, which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill.  We evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired.  Under current accounting rules, any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write-off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets, resulting in a charge to our earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense.



Our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local, and international taxing authorities.   An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.  We have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item.  These liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority.  While we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability.  An unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.



We record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes.  Deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates.  Changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our results of operations.



We may become subject to additional United States, state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services customers, in which case our earnings could be adversely affected.



Payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services.  Application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic.  If we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers, our costs will increase, reducing our earnings.













We have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions including those related to value added taxes in Europe.  Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive, the amount of our cash flow, and have a material adverse impact on our business.



Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.



Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report.  If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



Further, this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete.  In certain markets in the Asia-Pacific region, the Republic of Malta and Spain, our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements.  We expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations.  Accordingly, we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data, such as revenue billed to merchants, to assist us with compiling our accounting records.  As such, our internal controls over financial reporting could be materially affected, or are reasonably likely to be materially affected, by the internal controls and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets.  In order to mitigate this risk, we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting which monitor the accuracy of the financial data being provided by our member sponsors



While we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market's perception of our business and our stock price.



Anti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and provisions of Georgia law could delay or prevent a change of control that individual shareholders favor.



Provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, and provisions of applicable Georgia law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable.  The provisions of our articles and by-laws, among other things:



•divide our Board of Directors into three classes, with members of each class to be elected in staggered three-year terms;

•limit the right of shareholders to remove directors;

•regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders; and

•authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series, without shareholder approval.



We may not be able to or we may decide not to pay dividends at a level anticipated by shareholders of our common stock, which could reduce shareholder returns.



The payment of dividends on our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other factors, our earnings, shareholders' equity, cash position, and financial condition.  No assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.



Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.



We operate in a rapidly changing industry. Accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor, and manage our risks.  If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer uninsured liability, harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Continued consolidation in the banking and retail industries could adversely affect our growth.













Historically, the banking industry has been the subject of consolidation, regardless of overall economic conditions, while the retail industry has been the subject of consolidation due to cyclical economic events. Since 2008, there have been multiple bank failures and government-encouraged consolidation.  Larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower revenues and earnings for us.  Our bank alliances and other strategies could also be negatively impacted as a result of consolidations, especially where the banks involved operate competing merchant processing businesses.



The Company's debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit the Company's flexibility in operating its business.



Our credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:



•incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

•pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•sell certain assets;

•create liens;

•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; and

•enter into certain transactions with the Company's affiliates.



A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of the revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under certain of our other indebtedness. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our credit facilities could accelerate the repayment of borrowings, and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities as well as the Company's other indebtedness.

ITEM 7- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future.  Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” of this report.  See also “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” located above “Item 1 - Business.”



You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with  “Item 6 - Selected Financial Data” and “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” appearing elsewhere in this annual report.



General



We are a provider of electronic payments transaction processing services for consumers, merchants, independent sales organizations (ISOs), financial institutions, government agencies and multi-national corporations located throughout the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Republic of Malta, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation and the Asia-Pacific region.   We serve as an intermediary to facilitate payment transactions and operate in two business segments, North America merchant services and International merchant services.  We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company on January 31, 2001.  Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payments business since 1967.



Our North America merchant services and International merchant services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, gaming, government, health care, professional services, restaurants, retail, universities, nonprofit organizations and utilities.



Our offerings provide merchants, ISOs and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing and check-related services.  Our primary business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers. We also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs that, in turn, resell our products and services, in which case, the financial institutions and select ISOs are our end customers. These particular services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and parts of Eastern Europe.



The majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type. We also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Revenue from credit cards and signature debit cards is generally based on a percentage of transaction value along with other related fees, while revenue from PIN debit cards is typically based on a fee per transaction.



Our products and services are marketed through a variety of sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions.  We seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value.  We also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and Latin America.



Our business does not have pronounced seasonality in which more than 30% of our revenues occur in one quarter.  However, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the portfolio. While there is some variation in seasonality across markets, the first and fourth quarters are generally the strongest, and the third quarter tends to be the weakest due to lower volumes processed in the months of January and February.



Executive Overview















In fiscal 2013, revenues increased7.8%to$2,375.9 millionfrom$2,203.8 millionin fiscal 2012.  This revenue growth was primarily due to growth driven by our U.S. ISO channel, growth from our direct sales channels and gaming business, and growth in Europe; partially offset by market-based pricing compression in Canada.



Consolidated operating income was$357.2 millionfor fiscal2013, compared to$307.3 millionfor fiscal2012.  Consolidated operating income for fiscal2013and2012includes processing system intrusion costs of$36.8 millionand$84.4 million, respectively.  Net income attributable to Global Payments increased $27.9 million, or 14.8%, to$216.1 millionin fiscal2013from$188.2 millionin the prior year, resulting in a $0.39 increase in diluted earnings per share to$2.76in fiscal2013from$2.37in fiscal2012.



North America merchant services segment revenue increased$138.4 million, or8.8%, to$1,705.7 millionin fiscal2013from$1,567.3 millionin fiscal2012.  North America merchant services segment operating income decreased to$258.9 millionin fiscal2013from$281.3 millionin fiscal2012, with operating margins of15.2%and17.9%for fiscal2013and2012, respectively.



International merchant services segment revenue increased $33.6 million, or5.3%, to$670.2 millionin fiscal2013from$636.6 millionin fiscal2012.  International merchant services operating income also increased to$211.2 millionin fiscal2013from$196.1 millionin fiscal2012, with operating margins of31.5%and30.8%for fiscal2013and2012, respectively.



During fiscal 2013, we completed three acquisitions which expanded our distribution capabilities in the United States, Asia and Spain.  In October 2012, we acquired Accelerated Payment Technologies ("APT"), a U.S. provider of integrated payment technology solutions for small and medium sized merchants for a purchase price of$413.0 million, less working capital.  In December 2012, we completed the purchase of HSBC Asia's ("HSBC")44%interest in Global Payments Asia-Pacific Limited ("GPAP") for$242.0 million. Also in December 2012, Comercia Global Payments Entidad de Pago, S.L. ("Comercia"), based in Spain, completed the acquisition of the merchant acquiring business of Banca Civica, S.A. ("Civica") from CaixaBank, S.A. ("CaixaBank") for €17.5 million($22.9 millionequivalent as of the acquisition date).



In early March 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system. Our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services. The merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the U.S. We cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported; however, we notified potentially-affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals.



As a result of this event, certain card networks removed us from their list of PCI DSS compliant service providers. Our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete. We hired a Qualified Security Assessor, or QSA, to conduct an independent review of the PCI DSS compliance of our systems. Global Payments Direct, Inc., our primary operating entity, has been returned to the list of PCI DSS compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process, store, transmit or otherwise utilize card data. To date, we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event. However, this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues.



For year ended May 31, 2013, we recorded $36.8 million of expense associated with this incident, bringing our life-to-date expense to $121.2 million.  Of this life to date expense amount, $105.5 million represents costs incurred through May 31, 2013 for  professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance.  An additional $35.7 million represents total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. We also recorded $20.0 million of insurance recoveries. During fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by $31.8 million. We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. The primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected.

Processing System Intrusion



In early March 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system. Our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services. The merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the U.S. We cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported; however, we notified potentially-affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals.













As a result of this event, certain card networks removed us from their list of PCI DSS compliant service providers. Our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete. We hired a Qualified Security Assessor, or QSA, to conduct an independent review of the PCI DSS compliance of our systems. Our QSA completed the evaluation of our remediation work. Global Payments Direct, Inc, our primary operating entity, has been returned to the list of PCI DSS compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process, store, transmit or otherwise utilize card data. To date, we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event. However, this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues.



During the fiscal year endedMay 31, 2013, we recorded$36.8 millionof expense associated with this incident, bringing the life-to-date total expense to$121.2 million. Of this life-to-date expense, $105.5 million represents costs incurred throughMay 31, 2013for professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance.  An additional$35.7 millionrepresents total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. We also recorded$20.0 millionof insurance recoveries as discussed below. During fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by$31.8 million. We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. The primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected.





This event could result in additional lawsuits in the future. In addition, governmental entities have made inquiries and the Federal Trade Commission has initiated an investigation related to the event.  We have not recorded any loss accruals related to these items or any other claims (except as described above) that have been or may be asserted against us in relation to this incident as we have not determined that losses associated with any such claims or potential claims are probable.  Further, we do not have sufficient information to estimate the amount or range of possible losses associated with such matters.  As more information becomes available, if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such probable loss that we will incur on that claim is reasonably estimable, we will accrue our estimate of such loss. If and when we record such an accrual, it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations.



We were insured under policies that we believe may provide coverage of certain costs associated with this event. The policies provided a total of $30.0 million in policy limits and contain various sub-limits of liability and other terms, conditions and limitations, including a $1.0 million deductible per claim.  As ofMay 31, 2013, we have received$20.0 millionin insurance recoveries.  We will record receivables for any additional recoveries in the periods in which we determine such recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.



Revenues













We derive our revenues from four primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, service fees and equipment sales and rentals. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.



For fiscal2013, revenues increased 7.8% to$2,375.9 millioncompared to the prior year. This growth is primarily due to growth driven by our U.S. ISO channel, growth from our direct sales channels and gaming business, and growth in Europe; partially offset by market-based pricing compression in Canada.



Our revenues have been affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended May 31, 2013, currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $20.3 million compared to the prior year.  To calculate this we converted our fiscal2013actual revenues at fiscal2012rates.



North America Merchant Services Segment



For fiscal2013, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 8.8% compared to the prior year to$1,705.7 million. North America revenue growth was driven by our U.S. ISO channel, strong growth from our direct sales channels, gaming business and reduced interchange expense due to legislation.



We grow our United States revenue primarily by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, largely through our ISO channel.  For fiscal2013, our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 11.2% compared to the prior year. Increased spreads have offset the impact of lower average ticket, which decreased by 0.9% in fiscal2013. This decline in average ticket is primarily due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants.



For fiscal2013, our Canadian revenue decreased 6.4% to$311.0 millionwhile our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 3.2% compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenue was due to ongoing market-based pricing compression.



International Merchant Services Segment



For fiscal2013, International merchant services revenue increased 5.3% to$670.2 millioncompared to the prior year.  Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal2013increased 6.8% to$522.6 millioncompared to the prior year, driven primarily by strong transaction growth in all markets.  Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue of $147.7 million was flat for fiscal2013compared to the prior year resulting from a slight decrease of 0.8% in the number of credit and debit card processed transactions.



Consolidated Operating Expenses



Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessments and other fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses.  Cost of service increased 9.9% during fiscal2013, compared to the prior year primarily driven by revenue growth. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 36.3% for fiscal year 2013 from 35.6% in the prior year.



Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to ISOs, independent contractors, and other third parties; advertising costs; other selling expenses; share-based compensation expense and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions.  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 9.0% for fiscal2013compared to the prior year.  In addition, as a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 47.1% for fiscal 2013 from 46.6% in the prior year. These increases are primarily due to an increase in commission payments to ISOs and costs associated with our start up operations in Brazil.  These increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of ISO commission payments previously made to APT as a result of our acquisition of APT on October 1, 2012.













Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments



For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption “Corporate.” Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue.



North America Merchant Services Segment



Operating income in the North America merchant services segment decreased 8.0% for fiscal2013compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to market-based pricing compression in Canada.  The operating margin was 15.2% and 17.9% for the fiscal years2013and2012, respectively.  The decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by the ISO channel, including the impact of the Durbin amendment, Canadian spread compression and costs associated with our start up operation in Brazil.  These increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of ISO commission payments previously made to APT as a result of our acquisition of APT on October 1, 2012.  The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs.



Effective October 1, 2011, the new debit interchange legislation capped the amount of interchange that card issuers may charge on transactions.  Our interchange expenses decreased as a result of this. We recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased as a result of lower interchange expense with a resulting increase in operating income as well.  Increased revenues came primarily through our ISO channel, where reduced interchange fees led to higher revenues and a dollar-for-dollar increase in ISO commission expense, with an associated reduction in our operating margin.



International Merchant Services Segment



Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 7.7% to$211.2 millionfor fiscal2013compared to the prior year.  The operating margin was 31.5% and 30.8% for the fiscal years2013and2012, respectively. The increase in operating margin in our International merchant services segment is due to strong results in Europe, partially offset by last year's marketing fee true-up in Spain, whereby CaixaBank compensated us for favorable pricing to certain CaixaBank customers during the initial phase of our marketing alliance agreement.



Corporate



Our corporate expenses include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, expenses related to our Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines that have not been allocated to our business segments, insurance, employee incentive programs, share-based compensation programs, and certain corporate staff, including finance, accounting, information technology, including data security, legal, human resources, marketing and executive.  We also consider costs associated with the processing system intrusion to be a corporate expense. Our corporate costs decreased 33.6% to$112.9 millionfor fiscal2013compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion and charges related to two contractual disputes in fiscal 2012.



Consolidated Operating Income



During the fiscal year2013, our consolidated operating income increased $49.9 million to$357.2 millionfrom $307.3 million in the prior year.  The increase in our consolidated operating income is primarily due to solid financial results in North America and Europe and lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion in fiscal compared to 2012.



Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net



Other expense, net, increased to $22.9 million for fiscal2013compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. The increase is due to higher debt balances as well as an $8.4 million distribution to HSBC in fiscal 2013. This distribution was characterized as interest expense in accordance with the provision of ASC 480.  For further details, see Note 4 - Business and Intangible Asset Acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.















Provision for Income Taxes



Our effective tax rates were28.6%and27.6%for the years endedMay 31, 2013and2012, respectively.  The effective tax rates for the years endedMay 31, 2013and2012reflect adjustments to our U.K. deferred tax asset due to legislated enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the United Kingdom of 2% in each year.  Our effective tax rates differ from U.S. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion.



Noncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax



Noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the fiscal years2013and2012, respectively.  This decrease is primarily due to the fact that we stopped attributing income to the GPAP redeemable noncontrolling interest subsequent toJuly 26, 2012, the date of our agreement to purchase HSBC's interest.













Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2011



The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2011. Comercia's results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations and results of operations of our International merchant services segment from December 20, 2010, the date we acquired our controlling financial interest. Accordingly, results of operations for the year ended May 31, 2011 reflect the results of Comercia's operations for five months, while results of operations for the year ended May 31, 2012 reflect a full year of operating results.

(1)Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding.

(2)Includes processing system intrusion costs of$84.4 millionin fiscal 2012.



Processing System Intrusion



In early March of 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system.  During fiscal 2012, we recorded $84.4 million of expense associated with this event. For further details, see Note 2 - Processing System Intrusion in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.



Revenues













We derive our revenues from four primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, service fees and equipment sales and rentals. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.



For fiscal2012, revenues increased18.5%to$2,203.8 millioncompared to the prior year period primarily due to strong performance across most of our regions, and the impact of our acquisition of a 51.0% controlling financial interest in Comercia on December 20, 2010.



North America Merchant Services Segment



For fiscal2012, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased15.0%compared to the prior year to$1,567.3 million. The North America merchant services segment revenue growth was driven by our U.S. ISO channel, reduced interchange expense as explained below, strong growth from our gaming business and solid performance from our direct sales channel.



We grow our United States revenue by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISO channel.  For fiscal2012, our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 13.1% compared to the prior year. Increased spreads, primarily driven by lower interchange expense due to the Durbin amendment, have offset the impact of lower average ticket, which decreased by 3.2% in fiscal2012. This decline in average ticket is primarily due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants.  Based on our mix of merchants, slightly more than half of our United States transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit transactions, with PIN-based debit transactions representing less than 10.0% of our total transactions.



On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve board adopted the final rule implementing Section 1075 (“the Durbin amendment”) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Effective October 1, 2011, the Durbin amendment capped the amount of debit interchange that large card issuers may charge on debit transactions.  Our interchange expense decreased as a result of the Durbin amendment. We recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased for fiscal2012, as a result of lower interchange expense. We believe that any future benefits resulting from the Durbin amendment are uncertain due to our competitive marketplace.



For fiscal2012, our Canadian revenue remained flat while our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 4.5% compared to the prior year period. Our Canadian business experienced reduced spreads due to market-driven pricing pressure as compared to the prior year.



International Merchant Services Segment



For fiscal2012, International merchant services revenue increased28.1%to $636.6 million.



Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal2012increased36.1%to $489.3 million compared to the prior year. These revenue increases were driven primarily by the impact of our acquisition in Spain on December 20, 2010, pricing benefits in the United Kingdom and favorable foreign currency trends during fiscal2012.



Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal2012increased7.2%to $147.3 million compared to the prior year. The growth was due to solid business performance across the region. Revenues in the prior year included the roll-out of new products by a major retailer with both physical and e-commerce transactions in several markets in the region, continued growth of our installment payment plan and regional roll out of our dynamic currency conversion products.





Consolidated Operating Expenses



Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operations- and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessments and other fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs











associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses.  Cost of service increased 18.0% during fiscal2012, compared to the prior year period primarily driven by revenue growth. As a percentage of revenues, cost of service decreased to 35.6% for fiscal2012from 35.8% in the prior year.



Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to ISOs, independent contractors, and other third parties; advertising costs; other selling expenses; share-based compensation expense and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions.  Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 19.0% for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period.  This increase is primarily due to employee termination costs, charges for two contractual disputes, and an increase in commission payments to ISOs. As a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 46.6% for fiscal2012from 46.4% in the prior year.



Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments



For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption “Corporate.” Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue.



North America Merchant Services Segment



Operating income in the North America merchant services segment increased 4.9% for fiscal2012compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income was driven by growth in the U.S. primarily driven by our ISO and direct channels partially offset by market-based spread compression in Canada and, to a lesser extent, increased investment in Brazil. This resulted in operating margins decreasing during fiscal2012. The operating margin was 17.9% and 19.7% for the fiscal years2012and 2011, respectively.  The decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by ISO channel dilution, including the impact of the Durbin amendment, Canadian spread compression and costs associated with our start up in Brazil.



Effective October 1, 2011, the new debit interchange legislation capped the amount of interchange that card issuers may charge on transactions.  Our interchange expenses decreased as a result of this. We recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased as a result of lower interchange expense with a resulting increase in operating income as well.  Increased revenues came primarily through our ISO channel, where reduced interchange fees led to higher revenues and a dollar-for-dollar increase in ISO commission expense, with an associated reduction in our operating margin.



International Merchant Services Segment



Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 36.3% to $196.1 million for fiscal2012compared to the prior year period.  The operating margin was 30.8% and 29.0% for the fiscal years2012and 2011, respectively.  The increase in operating margin in our International merchant services segment is due in part to pricing benefits in the United Kingdom arising from changes to merchant discount rates upon conversion of our merchant portfolio to our processing platform, which allows us to more closely align pricing with underlying transaction characteristics. In addition, the increase in operating margin is partially attributable to a marketing fee true-up in Spain, whereby CaixaBank compensated us for favorable pricing terms extended to certain  CaixaBank customers during the initial phase of our marketing alliance agreement.



Corporate



Our corporate expenses include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, expenses related to our Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines that have not been allocated to our business segments, insurance, employee incentive programs, share-based compensation programs and certain corporate staff, including finance, accounting, information technology, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive.  Our corporate costs increased 111.2% to $170.1 million for fiscal2012compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily due to costs associated with the processing system intrusion, employee termination costs and charges for two contractual disputes. The prior year corporate costs included expenses related to our Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines and employee and termination benefits.













Consolidated Operating Income



During the fiscal year2012, our consolidated operating income decreased $24.2 million to $307.3 million compared to the prior year.  The decrease in our consolidated operating income is primarily due to costs associated with the processing system intrusion.



Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net



Other expense, net, decreased to $6.9 million for fiscal2012compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased during fiscal2012due to lower term loan borrowings.



Provision for Income Taxes



Our effective tax rates were 27.6% and 29.3% for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The effective tax rates for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011 reflect adjustments to our U.K. deferred tax asset due to legislated enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the United Kingdom of 2.0% and 1.0%, respectively.  Our effective tax rates differ from U.S. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion.



We have net deferred tax assets associated with our U.K. business of$92.8 million. The measurement of such deferred tax assets is based, in part, on the current enacted corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom. The2012United Kingdom budget includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 25.0% to 23.0%. Upon enactment of this rate, which was expected during the first half of our fiscal year 2013, we estimated that we will record a reduction in our U.K. deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision of approximately $5.0 million.



Noncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax



Noncontrolling interests, net of tax increased to $29.4 million from $18.9 million for the fiscal year2012and  2011, respectively.  This increase is primarily due to our acquisition of a 51% controlling financial interest in Comercia on December 20, 2010.







Liquidity and Capital Resources



A significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows.  Cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, and to pay down debt and repurchase shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors.  Accumulated cash balances are invested in high quality and marketable short-term instruments.



Our capital plan objectives are to support the Company’s operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital.  Lines of credit are used in certain of our markets to fund settlement and as a source of working capital and, along with other bank financing, to fund acquisitions.  We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise.



AtMay 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling$680.5 million. Of this amount, we consider $255.0 million to be available cash.  Our available cash balance includes $214.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered permanently reinvested for U.S. tax purposes. These cash balances reflect our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by each subsidiary's operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund non-U.S. acquisitions. We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries.  If we were to repatriate some or all of the cash held by such foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe that the associated income tax liabilities would have a significant impact on our liquidity.



Available cash excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances. Settlement related cash balances represent funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member









sponsors' funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement related cash balances are not restricted; however these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day.  Merchant reserve cash balances represent funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral (“Merchant Reserves”) to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement.  AtMay 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents included$280.7 millionrelated to Merchant Reserves. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks.  SeeCash and cash equivalentsandSettlement processing assets and obligationsunder Note 1 and Note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.



Operating activities provided net cash of$240.5 millionduring fiscal year2013compared to using net cash of$173.5 millionduring the prior year.  The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $464.3 million driven by the timing of month end cut-off.



Net cash used in investing activities increased from$150.4 millionto$528.6 millionfor the fiscal year endedMay 31, 2013from the prior year, primarily due to our use of $409.3 million and $22.9 million for the acquisitions of APT and Civica, respectively, during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.



For fiscal year2013, financing activities provided$183.5 millionin cash  compared to using$218.2 millionin cash in the prior year.  The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to proceeds of$700.0 millionfrom the term loan and $80.5 million from net long-term revolver borrowings. We used$242.0 millionof these proceeds to purchase the remaining 44% of GPAP from HSBC.  We also repurchased3,674,656shares of our common stock with a cash payment of$175.3 millionduring fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In addition, we made payments on term loans and notes payable in the amount of $126.0 million and we made net payments in the amount of$27.9 millionon our short-term revolver.



We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future.  During fiscal year 2014, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $90.0 million.

Lines of Credit



The Corporate Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes and to fund future strategic acquisitions. Our short-term lines of credit facilities are primarily used to fund settlement.  For certain of our lines of credit facilities, the maximum borrowing amount may exceed the stated credit limit by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender.  Accordingly, the line of credit balance may exceed the stated credit limit at any given point in time, when in fact the combined position is less than the credit limit. The total available incremental borrowings under our Corporate Credit Facilities atMay 31, 2013was$440.0 million. As of May 31, 2013, we had $796.1 million available to fund settlement under our short-term lines of credit.











During the year endedMay 31, 2013, the maximum and average borrowings under our lines of credit were$871.9 millionand$464.5 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates on these borrowings were1.8%and2.1%, respectively, for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012. Our maximum borrowed amount was greater than our average and period end borrowings due to the timing of settlement funding.

Term Loans



OnSeptember 28, 2012, we entered into a five-year unsecured$700.0 millionterm loan agreement with a syndicate of banks, which we used to partially fund our acquisition of APT and our purchase of HSBC Asia's 44% interest in GPAP and to repay the outstanding balance on the Corporate Credit Facility.  The term loan expires inSeptember 2017and bears interest, at our election, at the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus a leverage-based margin.  As ofMay 31, 2013, the annual interest rate on the term loan was2.2%.  The term loan has scheduled principal payments of$17.5 millionat the end of each fiscal quarter through maturity.  As ofMay 31, 2013, the outstanding balance of the term loan was$647.5 million.



On January 31, 2013, we repaid the outstanding balance of our five-year unsecured$200.0 millionterm loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the United States.  The term loan had a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a leverage based margin.



On July 10, 2012, we repaid the outstanding balance of our five-year unsecured$300.0 millionterm loan agreement ($230.0 millionand £43.5 million) with a syndicate of financial institutions.  The term loan had a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a leveraged-based margin.



Notes Payable



United Card Services, or UCS, our subsidiary in the Russian Federation, has notes payable with a total outstanding balance of approximately$6.0 millionatMay 31, 2013.  These notes have fixed annual interest rates of8.5%with maturity dates ranging fromJune 2013throughNovember 2016.



Compliance with Covenants











There are certain financial and non-financial covenants contained in our various credit facilities and term loans.  Our term loan agreements include financial covenants requiring a leverage ratio no greater than3.25to1.00and a fixed charge coverage ratio no less than2.50to1.00. We complied with these covenants as of and for the year endedMay 31, 2013.



Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest



As of May 31, 2012, we had a redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with our Asia-Pacific merchant services business. Global Payments Asia-Pacific Limited, or GPAP, is the entity through which we conduct our merchant acquiring business in the Asia-Pacific region.  We owned56%of GPAP and HSBC Asia owned the remaining44%.  The GPAP shareholders' agreement included provisions pursuant to which HSBC Asia could have compelled us to purchase, at the lesser of fair value or a net revenue multiple, additional GPAP shares from HSBC Asia (the “Put Option”).  Because the Put Option was not solely within our control, we classified this interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest and reported the maximum total redemption amount in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet.  In accordance with current accounting guidance, we adjusted our redeemable noncontrolling interest to reflect the maximum redemption amount as of May 31, 2012 with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheet.



OnJuly 26, 2012, outside the terms of the Put Option, we agreed to purchase all of HSBC Asia's interest in GPAP for$242.0 million. We accounted for the purchase of the remaining 44% of GPAP as an equity transaction with a reduction of redeemable noncontrolling interest of$146.0 millionand a reduction of retained earnings of$96 million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 480,Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity("ASC 480"), from the agreement date through the close of the transaction, we accounted for our commitment to purchase the remaining44%of GPAP as a freestanding forward contract. Accordingly as ofJuly 26, 2012, we stopped attributing income to redeemable noncontrolling interest and any subsequent distributions to holders of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are characterized as interest expense.  HSBC Asia is entitled to dividends through the closing of the transaction pursuant to the GPAP shareholders agreement and the purchase agreement. During fiscal 2013, we declared a dividend for fiscal year 2012 of which $8.4 million was paid to HSBC Asia. Such dividend is reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income in the accordance with the provisions of ASC 480. During fiscal year2014, we expect to declare an additional dividend related to GPAP operations through the closing date. We expect HSBC Asia's share of such dividend to be reflected in interest expense in our fiscal year2014consolidated statements of income.



Data Center Relocation



We have undertaken the relocation and redesign of our primary data center and processing system. We have entered into agreements related to this relocation and for the ongoing management of the data center,andwe are contractually committed to make payments for the ongoing management of our data center through December 31, 2016. These obligations are included in the operating leases and purchase obligations line of the table presented below.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under “Critical Accounting Estimates” below.



BIN/ICA Agreements



In connection with our acquisition of merchant credit card operations of banks, we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain of the banks.  These agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number ("BIN") for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association ("ICA") number for MasterCard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and MasterCard.  Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as ofMay 31, 2013.



Commitments and Contractual Obligations



The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as ofMay 31, 2013:











Payments Due by Future PeriodTotalLess than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 Years5+ Years(in thousands)Operating leases (Note 15) and purchase obligations$159,606$35,935$65,153$39,182$19,336Total debt, including current portion (Note 7)1,150,930259,796452,899438,235—Interest on long-term debt(1)49,37014,20923,34511,816—



(1)Interest on variable rate debt is based on rates effective and amounts borrowed as ofMay 31, 2013.



Note:  This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other current and long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.  At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these payments; therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.  We do not have any material purchase commitments as ofMay 31, 2013.





Critical Accounting Policies



In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates.  We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis.  In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.  We refer to accounting estimates of this type as “critical accounting estimates.”  The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.



We have considered the impact of the processing system intrusion on our critical accounting estimates related to goodwill, long-lived asset and internally developed software valuations. We currently do not believe this event or associated business impacts represent an impairment indicator with respect to any of our goodwill reporting units, individual long-lived assets or asset groups, or internally developed software, whether placed in service or currently under development.  Accordingly, we have not deemed it necessary to perform any interim goodwill impairment testing or impairment testing of internally developed software or other long-lived assets.  If in future periods we experience or project diminished cash flows due to merchant attrition or other effects of the event, we will reassess the assumptions that underlie the estimates made in preparing our financial statements.



Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions.  Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements.  You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” of this annual report.



Reserve for operating losses



As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as “operating losses.”  Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder.  Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter.  Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses.



We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged.  Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder.  In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason,








we may be liable for any such reversed charges.  We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk.  We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults.



We account for our potential liability for the full amount of the operating losses discussed above as guarantees.  We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of estimated known losses and estimated incurred but not reported losses. Estimated known losses arise from specific instances of, for example, merchant bankruptcies, closures or fraud of which we are aware at the balance sheet date, but for which the ultimate amount of associated loss will not be determined until after the balance sheet date.  Estimated known loss accruals are recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss is reasonably estimable. Estimated known losses are calculated at the merchant level based on chargebacks received to date, processed volume, and historical chargeback ratios. The estimate is reduced for any collateral that we hold. Accruals for estimated known losses are evaluated periodically and adjusted as appropriate based on actual loss experience. Incurred but not reported losses result from transactions that we process before the balance sheet date for which we have not yet received chargeback notification.  We estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to our direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume.  Historically, this estimation process has been materially accurate.



For the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012, and2011, our processed volume was $192.8 billion, $180.7 billion, and $167.3 billion, respectively.  For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of$9.5 million,$8.8 million, and$6.0 million, respectively.  As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0049%, 0.0049%, and 0.0036%, respectively, during the above periods.  For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $9.9 million, $9.6 million, and $8.7 million, respectively.  We believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis.  A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year endedMay 31, 2013would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.6 million.  As ofMay 31, 2013and2012, $2.3 million has been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.



In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter's bank.  We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks.  Our check guarantee loss reserve is comprised of estimated losses on returned checks and estimated incurred but not reported losses.  We estimate the loss on returned checks by applying historical collection rates to our claims receivable balance.  We estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to the face value of our guaranteed checks.  For each of the years ended

May 31, 2013

,


, and


, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.6 billion.  For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $11.7 million, $13.4 million, and $14.2 million, respectively.  As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.44%, 0.51%, and 0.55%, respectively.  For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $12.0 million, $13.8 million, and $14.5 million, respectively.  We believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis.  A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended

May 31, 2013

would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.8 million.  Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal


had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.51% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $1.1 million.  As of

May 31, 2013

and


, we had a check guarantee reserve of $3.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.



We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six to twelve month analysis of historic loss activity.  These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors.  For merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments.  For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols.  Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the economies in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Russian Federation at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers.









Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations



We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test.  Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may exceed their fair values.  When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.



We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2013.  Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and the impairment test consists of two steps.  In the first step the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed.  Step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.  The excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss.



We have six reporting units: North America Merchant Services, U.K. Merchant Services, Asia-Pacific Merchant Services, Central and Eastern Europe Merchant Services, Russia Merchant Services and Spain Merchant Services.  We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.  The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, EBITDA, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate.  We discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation.  The market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. Multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow.  Such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate.



Preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions.  Significant changes in our forecasts, the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.



AtMay 31, 2013, we had goodwill of$1,044.2 millionrecorded on our consolidated balance sheet.  We completed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test on January 1, 2013 and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of the carrying value.  No events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.



Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions.  Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years.  The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets.  The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements.  The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets.



We use the accelerated method of amortization for most our customer-related intangible assets.  In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.  We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period.  In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization







schedule accordingly.  These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business.  During fiscal2013, we did not adjust the amortization schedules.



We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships.  We use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks.



Capitalization of Internally Developed Software



We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers.  Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended.  The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives.  Costs incurred prior to the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.  Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. Such impairment would result in a charge to income. Total software capitalized at May 31, 2013 was

$167.1 million

.  Costs capitalized during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $29.2 million, $31.3 million, and $26.3 million, respectively.  Internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years.  Internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use.



As of May 31, 2013, we have placed into service$92.2 millionof hardware and software associated with our technology processing platform, referred to as G2;$5.7 millionof which was placed in service during fiscal 2013.  The vision for this platform is to serve as a front-end operating environment for merchant processing and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms that have higher cost structures.  Depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform.  We believe that this method is more representative of the platform's use than the straight-line method.  We are currently processing transactions on our G2 platform in eight markets in our Asia-Pacific region and for a limited number of U.S. merchants.  As these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to our G2 platform for fiscal 2013 was not significant.  Depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other merchants to the G2 platform.



Income Taxes



The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.  We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item.  Issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability.  When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.



Judgment will be required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.  To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made.  At May 31, 2013, our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our United Kingdom business of $90.7 million.  Our assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our projections of future business performance and viable tax planning strategies.  If future business performance fails to meet projections, we may determine that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In the event of such a determination, we would record a valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrecoverable with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes.



New Accounting Pronouncements



From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management







believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.



In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-05,"Foreign Currency Matters"("ASU 2013-05"). The amendments in ASU 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice about whether current literature applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investmentina foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a businesswithina foreign entity. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice for the treatment of business combinations achieved in stages (sometimes also referred to as step acquisitions) involving a foreign entity. ASU 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 . This standard is effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 . We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2013-05 on our consolidated financial statements.



In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11,"Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities"("ASU 2011-11"). The amendments in ASU 2011-11 require entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on an entity's financial position.  The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (i) offset in accordance with current literature or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current literature. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This standard will become effective for us beginning June 2013.   The disclosures required by ASU 2011-11 will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.




























ITEM 7A- QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK



Foreign Currency Risk



A significant amount of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies.   Consequently, our revenues and income generated in currencies other than the United States dollar are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  For fiscal2013, currency rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $19.1 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.04 as compared to the prior year.  To calculate this we converted our fiscal2013actual revenues and expenses at fiscal2012rates.



Generally, the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency.  As a result, we are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions which are not denominated in the functional currency. Gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period.  We seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching, when possible.  For the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011, our transaction gains and losses were insignificant.



Additionally, we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment, chargeback, and card network settlement transactions which are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction.  Gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenue for the period.



We are also impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investment in foreign operations.  Relative to our net investment in foreign operations, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the period-end rate of exchange.  The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in shareholders' equity.  Translation gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.



Interest Rate Risk



We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt.   We invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term.  These investments earn a floating rate of interest, and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes.



We have various term loans and lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets and for general corporate purposes and acquisitions. Interest rates on these term loans and lines of credit are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly.  As ofMay 31, 2013, there was$1,150.9 millionoutstanding on these term loans and lines of credit.



In certain of our credit card transaction processing markets, the Member uses its own funds to fund merchant settlement and charges us cost of funds.  Cost of funds are charged at prevailing market rates and fluctuate accordingly.



Our cash investments and debt are floating rate, and therefore do not carry material risk of change in fair value.  Our interest rate exposure related to a change in interest rates on net income is mitigated as an increase in rates increases both interest income and interest expense, and a reduction in rates reduces both interest income and interest expense.



Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and believe the market risk arising from cash investments and debt is not material.



A 1% increase in interest rates as ofMay 31, 2013would not have had a material adverse impact on our current or future consolidated net income or cash flows.



Derivative Financial Instruments



Historically, we have not entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate fluctuation risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk.  We may use derivative financial instruments in the future if we deem it useful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.













ITEM 8- FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA





REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Global Payments Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia



We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of May 31, 2013, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013, based on the criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended May 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated July 25, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's identification and self-reporting of unauthorized access into its processing system.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Global Payments Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of May 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in March 2012, the Company identified and self-reported unauthorized access into its processing system.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2013, based on the criteria established inInternal Control-Integrated Framework (1992)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 25, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Business, Consolidation and Presentation— Global Payments Inc. is a high-volume processor of electronic transactions for merchants, multinational corporations, financial institutions, consumers, government agencies and other business and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals.  Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a transaction can be completed.  We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. inSeptember 2000and we spun-off from our former parent company onJanuary 31, 2001.  Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payments business since1967.  Our fiscal year ends onMay 31, thus we refer to the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012, and2011as fiscal years2013,2012, and2011, respectively.



These consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries and all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and present our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.



Use of estimates—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Revenue recognition—Ourtwomerchant services segments primarily include processing solutions for credit cards, debit cards, electronic payments and check-related services.  Revenue is recognized as such services are performed.  Revenue for processing services provided directly to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by card issuing banks.  Our primary business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers. We also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of independent sales organizations ("ISOs") that, in turn, resell our products and services, in which case, the financial institutions and select ISOs are our end customers. The majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type. We also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Revenue from credit cards and signature debit cards is generally based on a percentage of transaction value along with other related fees, while revenue from PIN-based debit cards is typically based on a fee per transaction.



Cash and cash equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when purchased.  Cash and cash equivalents include reserve funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement (“Merchant Reserves”).  We record a corresponding liability in settlement processing assets and settlement processing obligations in our consolidated balance sheet.  While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with guidelines set by the card networks.  As ofMay 31, 2013and2012, our cash and cash equivalents included$280.7 millionand$328.2 million, respectively, related to Merchant Reserves.



Our cash and cash equivalents include settlement related cash balances. Settlement related cash balances represent surplus funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member sponsors’ funding obligation to the merchant.  Settlement related cash balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. Please see Note 3 - Settlement processing assets and obligations and discussion below for further information.



Inventory—Inventory, which includes electronic point of sale terminals, automated teller machines, and related peripheral equipment, is stated at the lower of cost or fair value.  Cost is determined by using the average cost method.



Settlement processing assets and obligations—Settlement processing assets and obligations represent intermediary balances arising in our settlement process for direct merchants. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 210-20,









Offsetting, we apply offsetting to our settlement processing assets and obligations where legal right of set off exists.  Please see Note 3 - Settlement Processing Assets and Obligations for further information.



Reserve for operating losses—As a part of our merchant credit and debit card processing and check guarantee services, we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which are collectively referred to as “operating losses.”



Our credit card processing merchant customers are liable for any charges or losses that occur under the merchant agreement.  In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other merchant-related reason, we may be liable for any such losses based on our merchant agreement.  We require cash deposits (Merchant Reserves), guarantees, letters of credit, and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability.  We also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk.  We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults.



We account for our potential liability for the full amount of the operating losses discussed above as guarantees.  We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of estimated known losses and estimated incurred but not reported losses. Estimated known losses arise from specific instances of, for example, merchant bankruptcies, closures or fraud of which we are aware at the balance sheet date, but for which the ultimate amount of associated loss will not be determined until after the balance sheet date.  Estimated known loss accruals are recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss is reasonably estimable. Estimated known losses are calculated at the merchant level based on chargebacks received to date, processed volume, and historical chargeback ratios. The estimate is reduced for any collateral that we hold. Accruals for estimated known losses are evaluated periodically and adjusted as appropriate based on actual loss experience. Incurred but not reported losses result from transactions that we process before the balance sheet date for which we have not yet received chargeback notification.  We estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to our direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume.  Historically, this estimation process has been materially accurate.



As ofMay 31, 2013and2012,$2.3 millionhas been recorded to reflect the fair value of guarantees associated with merchant card processing.  These amounts are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The expense associated with the fair value of the guarantees of customer chargebacks is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  For the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011, we recorded such expenses in the amounts of$9.5 million,$8.8 millionand$6.0 million, respectively.



In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter’s bank in accordance with the merchant’s agreement with us.  The fair value of the check guarantee approximates cost and is equal to the fee charged for the guarantee service, and we defer this fee revenue until the guarantee is satisfied.  We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered


% of the guaranteed checks.  Our check guarantee loss reserve is comprised of estimated losses on returned checks and estimated incurred but not reported losses.  We estimate the loss on returned checks by applying historical collection rates to our claims receivable balance.  We estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to the face value of our guaranteed checks.  As of

May 31, 2013

and


, we have a check guarantee loss reserve of

$3.1 million

and

$3.4 million

, respectively, which is included in net claims receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended

May 31, 2013

,


and


, we recorded expenses of

$11.7 million

,

$13.4 million

and

$14.2 million

, respectively, which are included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered in the future may differ significantly from estimates used in calculating the receivable valuation allowance.



As the potential for merchants’ failure to settle individual reversed charges from consumers in our merchant credit card processing offering and the timing of individual checks clearing the checkwriters’ banks in our check guarantee offering are not predictable, it is not practicable to calculate the maximum amounts for which we could be liable under the guarantees issued under the merchant card processing and check guarantee service offerings.  It is not practicable to estimate the extent to which merchant collateral or subsequent collections of dishonored checks, respectively, would offset these exposures due to these same uncertainties.



Property and equipment— Property and equipment are stated at amortized cost.  Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method, except for certain technology assets discussed below.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over









the lesser of the remaining term of the lease or the useful life of the asset.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.



We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers.  Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended.  The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives.  Costs incurred prior to the completion of the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.



As ofMay 31, 2013, we have placed into service$92.2 millionof hardware and software associated with our technology processing platform, referred to as G2;$5.7 millionof which was placed in service during fiscal 2013.  G2 serves as a front-end operating environment for merchant processing, and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms.  Depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform.  We believe that this method is more representative of the platform's use than the straight-line method.  We are currently processing transactions on our G2 platform ineightmarkets in our Asia-Pacific region and for a limited number of U.S. merchants.  As these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to our G2 platform for fiscal2013, 2012 and 2011 was not significant.  Depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other merchants to the G2 platform.



Goodwill and other intangible assets—We completed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as ofJanuary 1, 2013and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the carrying value.  No events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.



Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and the impairment test consists of two steps.  In the first step the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed.  Step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.  The excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill.  The excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss.



We havesixreporting units: North America Merchant Services, U.K. Merchant Services, Asia-Pacific Merchant Services, Central and Eastern Europe Merchant Services, Russia Merchant Services and Spain Merchant Services.  We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.  The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, EBITDA, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate.  We discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation.  The market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. Multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow.  Such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate.



Preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions.  Significant changes in our forecasts and the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.



Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of from5to30years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the









assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements.  The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets.



Amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. If the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business.



Impairment of long-lived assets—We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable.  When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded.  Fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analyses as applicable.  We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision.  In our opinion, the carrying values of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets, were not impaired atMay 31, 2013and2012.



Income taxes—Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax laws and rates.  A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



AtMay 31, 2013and 2012, our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our United Kingdom business of$90.7 millionand$92.8 million, respectively.



Our effective tax rates were28.6%,27.6%,29.3%for the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011, respectively.  The effective tax rates for the years endedMay 31, 2013and2012reflect adjustments to our U.K. deferred tax asset due to legislated enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the United Kingdom of2%.  Please see Note 9– Income Tax for further information.



Fair value of financial instruments—We consider that the carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair value given the short-term nature of these items.  Our term loans include variable interest rates based on the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on our leverage position. AtMay 31, 2013, the carrying amount of our term loans approximates fair value, which is calculated using Level 2 inputs. Our subsidiary in the Russian Federation has notes payable with a fixed interest rate of8.5%and maturity dates ranging fromJune 2013throughNovember 2016.  AtMay 31, 2013, we believe the carrying amount of these notes approximates fair value, which is calculated using Level 3 inputs.  Please see Note 7 – Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities for further information.



Financing receivables—Our subsidiary in the Russian Federation purchases Automated Teller Machines ("ATMs") and leases those ATMs to our sponsor bank.  We have determined these arrangements to be direct financing leases.  Accordingly, we have$6.3 millionand$9.1 millionof financing receivables included in ourMay 31, 2013and2012consolidated balance sheets, respectively.



There is an inherent risk that our customer may not pay the contractual balances due.  We periodically review the financing receivables for credit losses and past due balances to determine whether an allowance should be recorded. Historically we have not had any credit losses or past due balances associated with these receivables, and therefore we do not have an allowance recorded. We have hadnofinancing receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings nor have we had any purchases or sales of financing receivables.



Fair value measurements—GAAP requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date.  The reporting standard establishes consistency and comparability by providing a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels.  Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for









identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rates and yield curves.  Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our assumptions, and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability.



Foreign currencies—We have significant operations in a number of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency.  Gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in determining net income for the period.  For the years endedMay 31, 2013and2012, our transaction gains and losses were insignificant.



The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the period-end rate of exchange.  Income statement items are translated at the weighted average rates prevailing during the period. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in equity.  Translation gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.



Retirement Benefits-We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain of our United States employees who met the eligibility provisions at the time the plan was closed on June 1, 1998.  Benefits are based on years of service and the employee's compensation during the highestfiveconsecutive years of earnings out of the lasttenyears of service.  Plan provisions and funding meet the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”).  Effective May 31, 2004, we modified the pension plan to cease benefit accruals for increases in compensation levels.



We also have a noncontributory defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) coveringoneparticipant, whose employment ceased in fiscal 2002.  This plan was initially formed by our former parent company and was transferred to us in the spin-off transaction that occurred on January 31, 2001.  Benefits are based on years of service and the employee's compensation during the highestthreeconsecutive years of earnings out of the lasttenyears of service.  The SERP is a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan under ERISA.



The measurement date for the pension plans isMay 31, which coincides with the plans' fiscal year.  Our plan expenses for fiscal2013,2012and2011were actuarially determined. Due to the limited participation by employees in these plans and the related subsequent modifications, the total benefit obligation and funded status of the plans is not material and we have not provided full disclosure of such amounts.



Earnings per share—Basic earnings  per share is computed by dividing reported earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period.  Earnings available to common shareholders are the same as reported net income attributable to Global Payments for all periods presented.



Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing reported earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period and the impact of securities that would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share.  All options with an exercise price less than the average market share price for the period are assumed to have a dilutive effect on earnings per share.  The diluted share base for the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011excludes shares of0.3 million,0.2 millionand0.7 millionrespectively, related to stock options.  These shares were not considered in computing diluted earnings per share because including them would have had an antidilutive effect.  No additional securities were outstanding that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share.



The following table sets forth the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011:

201320122011(in thousands)Basic weighted average shares outstanding77,76778,82979,837Plus: dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards460602641Diluted weighted average shares outstanding78,22779,43180,478











Repurchased shares- We account for the retirement of repurchased shares using the par value method. Effective June 1, 2011, we elected to change our method of accounting under the par value method. We previously accounted for the retirement of repurchased shares by charging the entire cost to paid-in capital. Our new method of accounting allocates the cost of repurchased and retired shares between paid-in capital and retained earnings by comparing the price of shares repurchased to the original issue proceeds of those shares. When the repurchase price of the shares repurchased is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. We use a last-in, first-out cost flow assumption to identify the original issue proceeds to the cost of the shares repurchased.  We believe that this allocation method is preferable because it more accurately reflects our paid-in capital balances by allocating the cost of the shares repurchased and retired to paid-in capital in proportion to paid-in capital associated with the original issuance of said shares.



New accounting pronouncements— From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.



In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-05,"Foreign Currency Matters"("ASU 2013-05"). The amendments in ASU 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice about whether current literature applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice for the treatment of business combinations achieved in stages (sometimes also referred to as step acquisitions) involving a foreign entity. ASU 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning afterDecember 15, 2013. This standard is effective for us beginningJune 1, 2014. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2013-05 on our consolidated financial statements.



InDecember 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11,"Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities"("ASU 2011-11"). The amendments in ASU 2011-11 require entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on an entity's financial position.  The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (i) offset in accordance with current literature or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current literature. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 2013. This standard will become effective for us beginningJune 1, 2013.  The adoption of ASU 2011-11 will affect our disclosures of settlement processing assets and obligations. The disclosures required by ASU 2011-11 will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.







NOTE 2—PROCESSING SYSTEM INTRUSION



In early March of2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system.  Our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services. The merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the U.S.  We cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported; however, we notified potentially-affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals.



As a result of this event, certain card networks removed us from their list of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI DSS") compliant service providers. Our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete. We hired a Qualified Security Assessor, or QSA, to conduct an independent review of the PCI DSS compliance of our systems.  Global Payments Direct, Inc. our primary operating entity, has been returned to the list of PCI DSS compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process, store, transmit or otherwise utilize card data. To date, we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event. However, this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues.



During 2013, we recorded$36.8 millionof expense associated with this incident, bringing the life-to-date total expense to$121.2 million. Of this life-to-date expense,$105.5 millionrepresents costs incurred throughMay 31, 2013for professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance.  An additional$35.7 millionrepresents total fraud losses, fines and other









charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. We have also received$20.0 million($2.0 millionin fiscal 2012 and$18.0 millionin fiscal 2013) of insurance recoveries, which are netted with related expenses, as discussed below. During fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by$31.8 million. We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. The primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected. The following table reflects the activity in our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges for the twelve months endedMay 31, 2013(in thousands):



Balance at May 31, 2012$67,436Adjustments(31,781)Subtotal35,655Payments(35,655)Balance at May 31, 2013$—





We were insured under policies that provided coverage of certain costs associated with this event. The policies provided a total of$30.0 millionin policy limits and contained various sub-limits of liability and other terms, conditions and limitations, including a$1.0 milliondeductible per claim.   As of fiscal year 2013, we received assessments from certain networks and submitted additional claims to the insurers and recorded$20.0 millionin additional insurance recoveries based on our negotiations with our insurers.  We will record receivables for any additional recoveries in the periods in which we determine such recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.











NOTE 3—SETTLEMENT PROCESSING ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS



We are designated as a Merchant Service Provider by MasterCard and an Independent Sales Organization by Visa.  These designations are dependent upon member clearing banks (“Member”) sponsoring us and our adherence to the standards of the networks.  We have primary financial institution sponsors in the various markets where we facilitate payment transactions with whom we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements.  These agreements allow us to route transactions under the member banks' control and identification numbers to clear credit card transactions through MasterCard and Visa.  In certain markets, we are members in various payment networks, allowing us to process and fund transactions without third-party sponsorship.



Funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between card issuers and merchants. For transactions processed on our systems, we use our internal network telecommunication infrastructure to provide funding instructions to the Members who in turn fund the merchants. The standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds, and, instead, require that these funds be in the possession of the Member until the merchant









is funded. However, in practice and in accordance with the terms of our sponsorship agreements with our Members, we generally follow a net settlement process whereby, if the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the Member's funding obligation to the merchant, we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the Member in our account at the Member bank and record a corresponding liability.  Conversely, if the Member's funding obligation to the merchant precedes the incoming amount from the card networks, the amount of the Member's net receivable position is either subsequently advanced to the Member by us or the Member satisfies this obligation with its own funds.  If the Member uses its own funds, the Member may assess funding cost, which is included in interest and other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services.



Timing differences, interchange expense, Merchant Reserves and exception items cause differences between the amount the Member receives from the card networks and the amount funded to the merchants.  These intermediary balances arising in our settlement process for direct merchants are reflected as settlement processing assets and obligations on our statement of financial position.  Settlement processing assets and obligations consist of the components outlined below:



•Interchange reimbursement - our receivable from merchants for the portion of the discount fee related to reimbursement of the interchange expense.

•Receivable from Members - our receivable from the Members for transactions we have funded merchants on behalf of the Members in advance of receipt of card association funding.

•Receivable from networks - our receivable from the card networks for transactions processed on behalf of merchants where we are a Member of that particular network.

•Exception items - items such as customer chargeback amounts received from merchants.

•Merchant Reserves - reserves held to minimize contingent liabilities associated with losses that may occur under the merchant agreement.

•Liability to Members - our liability to the Members for transactions for which we have received funding from the Members but have not funded merchants on behalf of the Members. Also cases in which the Member uses its own funds to satisfy a funding obligation to merchants that precedes the incoming amount from the card network.

•Liability to merchants - our liability to merchants for transactions that have been processed but not yet funded where we are a Member of that particular network.

•Reserve for operating losses - see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

•Reserve for sales allowances.



In accordance with ASC 210-20,Offsetting, we apply offsetting to our settlement processing assets and obligations where legal right of setoff exists. We apply this offsetting by Member because the Member is ultimately responsible for funds settlement. With these Member transactions, we do not have access to the gross proceeds of the receivable and do not have a direct obligation or any ability to satisfy the payable that funds the merchant. In these situations, we apply offsetting to determine a net position with each member sponsor. If that net position is an asset, we reflect the net amount in settlement processing assets on our balance sheet and we present the individual components in the settlement processing assets table below. If that net position is a liability, we reflect the net amount in settlement processing obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and we present the individual components in the settlement processing obligations table below. In markets where we have direct membership, offsetting is not applied, and the individual components are presented as an asset or obligation based on the nature of that component.

The business acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition.  The operating results of each acquisition are included in our consolidated statements of income from the dates of each acquisition.



Fiscal 2013











Accelerated Payment Technologies



OnOctober 1, 2012, we completed the acquisition of100%of the common stock of Accelerated Payment Technologies ("APT") for$413.0 millionless working capital. We funded the acquisition using proceeds from a term loan. We acquired APT, a provider of fully-integrated payment technology solutions for small and medium sized merchants, to expand our direct distribution capabilities in the United States. This acquisition has been recorded as a business combination, and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.  The purchase price of APT was determined by analyzing the historical and prospective financial statements. Acquisition costs associated with this purchase were not material.



The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation (in thousands):

Goodwill$308,518Customer-related intangible assets97,200Contract-based intangible assets30,600Acquired technology15,000Fixed assets1,309Other assets3,708Total assets acquired456,335Deferred income taxes(46,167)Net assets acquired$410,168



The goodwill associated with the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.  The customer-related intangible assets have estimated amortization periods of12years. The contract-based intangible assets have amortization periods of1.5to10years. The acquired technology has an amortization period of8years.



Prior to the acquisition, we processed transactions for the majority of APT's merchants via an ISO relationship. As a result, our revenue will not materially change with this acquisition and the amount of incremental revenue and earnings of APT since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2013 is not material. With the acquisition, we will no longer pay a monthly residual to APT. The following pro forma information shows the results of our operations for fiscal year ended  May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012 as if the APT acquisition had occurred June 1, 2011. The pro forma information is presented for information purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been made as of that date. The pro forma information is also not intended to be a projection of future results due to the integration of the acquired business.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Acquisition



OnJuly 26, 2012, we entered into an agreement to purchase HSBC Asia's ("HSBC")44%interest in Global Payments Asia-Pacific Limited ("GPAP") for fair value of$242.0 million.  EffectiveDecember 1, 2012, we completed the purchase. We used a combination of excess cash and existing borrowings to complete the transaction.











The purchase was treated as an equity transaction and reflected as a financing cash outflow in our statement of cash flows. Accordingly, no additional value was ascribed to the assets of GPAP. The difference between the maximum redemption amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest at

July 26, 2012

and our purchase price was recorded as a reduction of paid-in capital of

$96.0 million

. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 480,

Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity

("ASC 480"), from the agreement date through the close of the transaction, we accounted for our commitment to purchase the remaining

44%

of GPAP as a freestanding forward contract. Accordingly as of

July 26, 2012

, we stopped attributing income to redeemable noncontrolling interest and any subsequent distributions to holders of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are characterized as interest expense.  HSBC is entitled to dividends through the closing of the transaction pursuant to the GPAP shareholders agreement and the purchase agreement. During fiscal 2013, we declared a dividend for fiscal year 2012 of which

$8.4 million

was paid to HSBC. Such dividend is reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income in the accordance with the provisions of ASC 480. During fiscal year


, we expect to declare an additional dividend related to GPAP operations through the closing date. We expect HSBC's share of such dividend to be reflected in interest expense in our fiscal year


consolidated statements of income.



Banca Civica



OnDecember 12, 2012, Comercia Global Payments Entidad de Pago, S.L. ("Comercia") completed the acquisition of the merchant acquiring business of Banca Civica, S.A. ("Civica") from CaixaBank, S.A.

This transaction has been recorded as a business combination, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price of Civica was determined by analyzing the historical and prospective financial statements. The results of operations of this business were not significant to our consolidated results of operations and accordingly, we have not provided pro forma information relating to this acquisition. Acquisition costs associated with this purchase were not material.

Fiscal 2011



Comercia Global Payments Entidad de Pago, S.L.



On

December 20, 2010

, we acquired a

51%

controlling financial interest in Comercia, a newly formed company into which CaixaBank contributed its merchant acquiring business in Spain. CaixaBank owns the remaining

49%

of Comercia. We formed Comercia with CaixaBank, one of the largest retail banks in Spain, to provide merchant acquiring services to merchants in Spain. We purchased our share of Comercia for

€125 million

. The shareholders contributed a total of

€6.4 million

as initial capital to form Comercia. Our total investment in Comercia, including our

51%

share of the initial capital was

€128.3 million

(

$173.5 million

as of the closing date).  We manage the day-to-day operations of the corporation, control all major decisions and, accordingly, consolidate the corporation’s financial results for accounting purposes effective with the closing date. In conjunction with the acquisition, CaixaBank agreed to a

twenty

year marketing alliance agreement in which CaixaBank will refer customers to Comercia for payment processing services in Spain and provide sponsorship into the card networks.  We funded the purchase with a combination of existing cash resources in Europe and borrowings on our Corporate Credit Facility. During fiscal 2011, we expensed acquisition costs of

$1.0 million

associated with this transaction. These costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The results of operations of Comercia from the date of acquisition through the end of fiscal 2011 were not significant to our fiscal 2011 consolidated results of operations.



The purchase price of Comercia was determined by analyzing the historical and prospective financial statements. The results of operations of this business were not significant to our consolidated results of operations and accordingly, we have not provided pro forma information relating to this acquisition.

Deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement values and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred income taxes as ofMay 31, 2013and2012reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes.  As ofMay 31, 2013and2012, principal components of deferred tax items were as follows:

Undistributed earnings of$407.4 millionfrom certain foreign subsidiaries are permanently invested abroad and will not be repatriated to the United States in the foreseeable future.  In accordance with FASB guidance, because those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, no domestic federal or state deferred income taxes have been provided thereon.  Upon distribution of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.  Because of the availability of United States foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the domestic federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.



A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Changes to our valuation allowance during the fiscal year endedMay 31, 2013and2012are summarized below (in thousands):

Due to theJune 12, 2009acquisition of the remaining49%interest in our U.K. merchant acquiring business from HSBC Merchant Services, LLP, our tax basis in the LLP exceeds our book basis and we recorded a deferred tax asset, currently valued at$90.7 million.



As ofMay 31, 2013, other long-term liabilities included liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits of$53.8 million.



A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended May 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 is as follows:

As ofMay 31, 2013, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is$2.0 million. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that will impact income tax during the upcoming fiscal year is insignificant.



We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits in interest expense and accrued penalty expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in sales, general and administrative expenses.  Interest and penalties recognized in the income statement were insignificant in fiscal years2013,2012and2011.



We conduct business globally and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.  In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the United States and the United Kingdom.  We are currently under examination for fiscal years endedMay 31, 2011andMay 31, 2010with taxing authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom. We are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years endedMay 31, 2006and prior.







NOTE 10—SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY











OnJuly 26, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to$150.0 millionof Global Payments' stock in the open market at the current market price, subject to market conditions, business opportunities, and other factors. On January 8, 2013, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase program of up to$150.0 million, bringing the total share repurchase authorization to$300.0 million.



OnJanuary 14, 2013, pursuant to the authorization described above, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase program (''ASR'') with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of$125.0 millionof the Company's common stock. In exchange for an up-front payment of$125.0 million, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during the ASR's purchase period, which ended on March 30, 2013. The total number of shares delivered under this ASR was2,544,455at an average price of$49.13per share. These shares were retired and accounted for as a reduction of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet. We accounted for the initial delivery of shares component of the ASR as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share. We accounted for the variable component of shares to be delivered under the ASR as a forward contract indexed to our stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument, but instead was also accounted for as a component of equity.



In addition to the shares repurchased under the ASR, we repurchased1,130,201shares of our common stock at a cost of$50.3 million, or an average of$44.55per share, including commissions, during fiscal2013.



OnAugust 8, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the purchase of up to$100.0 millionof Global Payments’ stock in the open market at the current market price, subject to market conditions, business opportunities, and other factors. Under this authorization, we repurchased2,290,059shares of our common stock at a cost of$99.6 million, or an average of$43.49per share, including commissions, during fiscal2012.  This share repurchase program has concluded.





NOTE 11—SHARE-BASED AWARDS AND OPTIONS



As ofMay 31, 2013, we have awards outstanding underfourshare-based employee compensation plans.  The fair value of share-based awards is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.



Non-qualified stock options and restricted stock have been granted to officers, key employees and directors under the Global Payments Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2000 Plan”), the Global Payments Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), an Amended and Restated 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the “Director Plan”), and the Global Payments Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) (collectively, the “Plans”).  There were no further grants made under the 2000 Plan after the 2005 Plan was effective and the Director Plan expired by its terms on February 1, 2011 so no further grants will be granted thereunder.



OnSeptember 27, 2011, we held our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders approved the 2011 Plan, a plan that permits grants of equity to employees, officers, directors and consultants. A total of7.0 millionshares of our common stock was reserved and made available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Plan.  Effective with the adoption of the 2011 Plan, there will be no future grants under the 2005 Plan.



The following table summarizes the share-based compensation cost charged to income for (i) all stock options granted, (ii) our restricted stock program (including PRSUs and TSRs), and (iii) our employee stock purchase plan.  The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation in the accompanying statements of income is also presented.

Restricted Stock



Shares and performance units awarded under the restricted stock program of the Plans are held in escrow and released to the grantee upon the grantee’s satisfaction of conditions of the grantee’s restricted stock agreement.  The grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the quoted fair market value of our common stock at the award date.



Certain executives are grantedtwodifferent types of performance units under our restricted stock program. A portion of those performance units represent the right to earn0%to200%of a target number of shares of Global Payments common stock depending upon the achievement level of certain performance measures during the grant year (“PRSUs”).  The target number of PRSUs and the performance measures (at threshold, target, and maximum) are set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. PRSUs are converted to a time-based restricted stock grant only if the Company's performance during the fiscal year exceeds pre-established goals. The other portion of these performance units represent the right to earn0%to200%of target shares of Global Payments stock based on Global Payments' relative total shareholder return compared to peer companies over athreeyear performance period ("TSRs"). The target number of TSRs for each executive is set by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors and a monte carlo simulation is used to calculate the estimated share payout.



Grants of restricted awards are subject to forfeiture if a grantee, among other conditions, leaves our employment prior to expiration of the restricted period.  New grants of restricted awards generally vest one year after the date of grant in25%increments over afouryear period, with the exception of TSRs which vest after athreeyear period.



The following table summarizes the changes in non-vested restricted stock awards for the years endedMay 31, 2013and2012(share awards in thousands):

The total fair value of share awards vested during the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011was$13.6 million,$12.9 millionand$10.8 million, respectively.



We recognized compensation expense for restricted stock of$16.2 million,$13.6 million, and$12.5 millionin the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011, respectively.  As ofMay 31, 2013, there was $33.5 millionof total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of2.5years.





Employee Stock Purchase Plan



We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which the sale of2.4 millionshares of our common stock has been authorized.  Employees may designate up to the lesser of$25,000or20%of their annual compensation for the purchase of stock.  The price for shares purchased under the plan is85%of the market value on the last day of the quarterly purchase period.  As ofMay 31, 2013,









1.0 millionshares had been issued under this plan, with1.4 millionshares reserved for future issuance.  We recognized compensation expense for the plan of$0.5 millionin the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011.



The weighted average grant-date fair value of each designated share purchased under this plan during the years endedMay 31, 2013,2012and2011was$6,$7and$6, respectively, which represents the fair value of the15%discount.



Stock Options



Stock options are granted at100%of fair market value on the date of grant and have10-year terms.  Stock options granted vest one year after the date of grant in25%increments over afouryear period.  The Plans provide for accelerated vesting under certain conditions.  There werenooptions granted under the Plans during the years ended May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012.



The following is a summary of our stock option activity as of and for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012:

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the fiscal years ended 2013, 2012 and 2011 was$6.3 million,$4.4 millionand$14.8 million, respectively. We recognized compensation expense for stock options of$1.7 million,$2.4 million, and$2.9 millionin the years ended May 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of May 31, 2013, we had$1.1 millionof total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of0.65 years.



The weighted average grant-date fair values of each option granted in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 under each plan are as follows:



2013201220112005 Plan$—$—$11Director Plan$—$—$12













The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants during  fiscal  2011:



20112005 Plan:Risk-free interest rates1.74%Expected volatility31.96%Dividend yields0.21%Expected lives5 yearsDirector Plan:Risk-free interest rates1.31%Expected volatility31.96%Dividend yields0.21%Expected lives5 years





The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant.  Our assumption on expected volatility is based on our historical volatility.  The dividend yield assumption is calculated using our average stock price over the preceding year and the annualized amount of our current quarterly dividend.  We based our assumptions on the expected lives of the options on our analysis of the historical exercise patterns of the options and our assumption on the future exercise pattern of options.

NOTE 15—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES











Leases



We conduct a major part of our operations using leased facilities and equipment.  Many of these leases have renewal and purchase options and provide that we pay the cost of property taxes, insurance and maintenance.  Rent expense on all operating leases for fiscal2013,2012and2011was$16.5 million,$16.0 million, and$14.0 million, respectively.

Legal



We are party to a number of claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. In our opinion, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations.



Operating Taxes



We define operating taxes as taxes that are unrelated to income taxes, such as sales, property, value-add and other business taxes.  During the course of operations, we must interpret the meaning of various operating tax matters in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.  Taxing authorities in those various jurisdictions may arrive at different interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to such operating tax matters, which could result in the payment of additional taxes in those jurisdictions.  As ofMay 31, 2013and2012, we did not have liabilities for contingencies related to operating tax items based on management's best estimate given our history with similar matters and interpretations of current laws and regulations.



BIN/ICA Agreements



We have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. These agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number ("BIN") for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association ("ICA") number for MasterCard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and MasterCard. Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as ofMay 31, 2013.



Our Canadian Visa sponsorship, which was originally obtained through a Canadian financial institution, expired in March 2011.  We have filed an application with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada ("OSFI") for the formation of a wholly owned loan company in Canada which would serve as our financial institution sponsor. On December 12, 2012, the loan company received a restricted Order to Commence and Carry on Business from OSFI which will enable the loan company to become a direct Visa member at such time that Global Payments concludes the appropriate BIN transfer process with Visa.  In March 2011, we obtained temporary direct participation in the Visa Canada system, while the loan company application was pending.  We anticipate that the BIN transfer process with Visa will be completed by September 30, 2013.

ITEM 9- CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE



None.





ITEM 9A- CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



As ofMay 31, 2013, management carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as ofMay 31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



Our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as ofMay 31, 2013.  In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) inInternal Control-Integrated Framework.As ofMay 31, 2013, management believes that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.  Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this annual report.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.  Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.  Due to such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.  However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.  Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, such risk.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that occurred during the quarter endedMay 31, 2013that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
