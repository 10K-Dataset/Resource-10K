Item 1A.RISK FACTORS



Some of the statements in this report and, in particular, statements found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity, earnings, expenditures and financial condition. These statements are often identified by the words “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “hope,” or similar expressions. These statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described below.



Our actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition. In view of these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof.



In addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this Form 10-K (particularly in "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") or in our other filings with the










Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forward-looking statement.



Industry Risks



Industry Cyclicality - Changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.Macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity create changes in prices, sales volumes, and margins for most of our products, particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products.



Prices for all of our products are driven by many factors, including general economic conditions, demand for our products, and competitive conditions in our industry, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. If supply exceeds demand, prices for our products could decline, resulting in decreased earnings and cash generated from operations. Additionally, market conditions beyond our control can affect the prices for our commodity products. Our ability to achieve acceptable operating performance and margins depends primarily upon managing our cost structure and general operating conditions. If the prices for our products decline or if we are unable to control our costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.



Competition  - The intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume, which could lower earnings and cash generated from operations.Our industries are highly competitive, with no single containerboard, corrugated packaging or white paper producer having a dominant position. Containerboard and commodity white paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to intensify price competition. The corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as other factors including innovation, design, quality, and service. To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could be adversely affected. Our packaging products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal. Our white paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products. The intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products, both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.



Several of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources, greater manufacturing economies of scale, greater energy self sufficiency, or lower operating costs, compared with our company. We may be unable to compete with these companies particularly during economic downturns. Some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors (including overseas producers) into the markets we serve, our competitors' pricing strategies, our inability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, and our inability to maintain the cost-efficiency of our facilities.



Company Risks



Cost of Fiber - An increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings.The market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability, source, and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber. The cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather, general logging conditions, and geography.



The availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products. We purchase recycled fiber for use at seven of our eight mills. In 2013, including Boise's operations as if we had acquired Boise on January 1, 2013, we would have purchased approximately 480,000 tons of recycled fiber, net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants. The amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber.



Periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility. Periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future, which could result in lower or volatile earnings.



Cost of Purchased Energy and Chemicals - An increase in the cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced earnings.We have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations, including coal, bark, natural gas and oil. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past. New and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage, or make more expensive, the use of certain fuels. In addition, costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing also fluctuate. These










fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility. If energy and chemical prices rise, our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings.



Material Disruption of Manufacturing - A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities, particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within such facilities, could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events, including:



•Unscheduled maintenance outages.

•Prolonged power failures.

•Equipment failure.

•Explosion of a boiler.

•Disruption in the supply of raw materials, such as wood fiber, energy, or chemicals.

•A chemical spill or release.

•Closure related to environmental concerns.

•Labor difficulties.

•Disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks, and tunnels.

•Fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other catastrophes.

•Terrorism or threats of terrorism.

•Other operational problems.



These events could harm our ability to serve our customers and lead to higher costs and reduced earnings.



Environmental Matters - PCA may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations.We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those laws. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years. New and more stringent environmental regulations, including new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules relating to industrial boiler emissions known as the Boiler MACT rules, are expected to require us to incur significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers. In addition, environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy. Although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing, these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, which might require additional significant environmental expenditures.



Customer Concentration - OfficeMax represents a significant portion of PCA’s paper business.

We have a supply agreement with OfficeMax, our largest customer in the paper segment. The agreement requires OfficeMax to buy, and us to supply, at least 80% of OfficeMax’s requirements for office papers through December 2017; however, there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017. In November 2013, OfficeMax merged with Office Depot. Our agreement with OfficeMax provides that it survives the merger with respect to the office paper requirements of the legacy OfficeMax business. We cannot predict how the merger will affect the financial condition of the combined company, the paper requirements of the legacy OfficeMax business, or the effects on the pricing and competition for office papers. In 2013, for the period of October 25, 2013, to December 31, 2013, our sales revenue to Office Depot (including OfficeMax) accounted for

38%

of Paper segment sales. Significant reductions in paper purchases from the post-merger entity would cause our paper business to attempt to expand its customer base and could potentially decrease its profitability if new customer sales required either a decrease in its pricing and/or an increase in its cost of sales. Any significant deterioration in the financial condition of the post-merger entity affecting the ability to pay or causing a significant change in the willingness to continue to purchase our products could harm our business and results of operations.



Acquisition Integration - The acquired businesses of Boise may underperform relative to our expectations, and we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses.The acquired businesses of Boise may underperform relative to our expectations, which may cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations. If the acquired businesses underperform relative to our expectations, or if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.



Cyber Security - Risks related to security breaches of company, customer, employee, and vendor information, as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes, could adversely affect our business.We rely on










various information technology systems to capture, process, store, and report data and interact with customers, vendors, and employees. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating, and internal and independent third-party assessments, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber attacks or security breaches. Network, system, and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational disruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. Misuse of internal applications; theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other corporate assets; and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. Delayed sales, slowed production, or other repercussions resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales, business delays, and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or cash flows.



Risks Related to Economic, Financial, and Investment Risk



Increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations.We increased our indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of Boise from $807.6 million (including capital leases) as of September 30, 2013, to approximately $2,572.7 million at December 31, 2013. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The increase in indebtedness from the acquisition of Boise, plus any future borrowings, may affect our future operations, including, without limitation:



•Result in additional cash requirements to make interest and maturity payments on our outstanding indebtedness;

•Increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in our business or industry conditions;

•Limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes;

•Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and

•Limit our flexibility to make acquisitions.



Further, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing investments.



Market Price of our Common Stock - The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.Securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly.



General Economic Conditions - Adverse business and global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.General global economic conditions adversely affect the demand and production of consumer goods, employment levels, the availability and cost of credit, and ultimately, the profitability of our business. High unemployment rates, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, and lower consumer spending typically result in decreased demand for our products. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.
