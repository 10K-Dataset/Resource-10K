Item1A.    Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including those discussed below. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. In addition, please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item7of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Risk factors related to our overall business:

If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government laws and regulations, such as Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the Stark Law and analogous state self-referral prohibition statutes, the 21

st

Century Cures Act, Federal Acquisition Regulations, the False Claims Act (FCA) and associated regulations, the Civil Monetary Penalty statute and associated regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) and the storage, handling, shipment, disposal and/or dispensing of pharmaceuticals and blood products and other biological materials and many other applicable state and federal laws and requirements. Medicare and Medicaid regulations, manual provisions, local coverage determinations, national coverage determinations and agency guidance impose complex and extensive requirements upon healthcare providers as well. Moreover, the various laws and regulations that apply to our operations are often subject to varying interpretations and additional laws and regulations potentially affecting providers continue to be promulgated that may impact us. A violation or departure from any of the legal requirements implicated by our business may result in, among other things, government audits, lower reimbursements, significant fines and penalties, the potential loss of certification, recoupment efforts or voluntary repayments. These legal requirements are civil, criminal and administrative in nature depending on the law or requirement.

Additionally, the federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded health care programs. Moreover, amendments to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) make claims tainted by anti-kickback violations potentially subject to liability under the FCA, includingqui tamor whistleblower suits. The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim plus three times the amount of damages caused by each such claim which generally means the amount received directly or indirectly from the government. On January 29, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties, under which the per claim penalty range increases to a range from $11,181 to $22,363 for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015. Given the high volume of claims processed by our various operating units, the potential is high for substantial penalties in connection with any alleged FCA violations.

In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.










Certain subpoenas and civil investigative demands received by us or our subsidiaries specifically reference that they are in connection with FCA investigations alleging, among other things, that we or our subsidiaries presented or caused to be presented false claims for payment to the government. See Note17to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details.

We are subject to a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) which, for our domestic dialysis business, requires us to report probable violations of criminal, civil or administrative laws applicable to any federal health care program for which penalties or exclusions may be authorized under applicable healthcare laws and regulations. See "If we fail to comply with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation."

If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:

•Suspension or termination of our participation in government payment programs;

•Refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods;

•Loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;

•Loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in the states in which we operate;

•Reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and pharmaceuticals;

•Criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law, Stark Law and FCA, or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;

•Enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their protected health information (PHI) has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including HIPAA and the Privacy Act of 1974;

•Mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses;

•Imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things;

•Termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, including joint venture arrangements, medical director agreements, real estate leases and consulting agreements with physicians; and

•Harm to our reputation which could negatively impact our business relationships, affect our ability to attract and retain patients and physicians, affect our ability to obtain financing and decrease access to new business opportunities, among other things.

We are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, demands, claims,qui tamsuits, governmental investigations and audits (including investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law) and other legal matters, any of which could result in, among other things, substantial financial penaltiesor awards against us, mandated refunds, substantial payments made by us, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs and possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and materially harm our reputation.

We are the subject of a number of investigations and audits by governmental agencies. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to other investigations and audits by state or federal governmental agencies and/or private civilqui tamcomplaints filed by relators and other lawsuits, demands, claims and legal proceedings, including investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law.










Responding to subpoenas, investigations and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings as well as defending ourselves in such matters will continue to require management's attention and cause us to incur significant legal expense. Negative findings or terms and conditions that we might agree to accept as part of a negotiated resolution of pending or future legal or regulatory matters could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, harm to our reputation, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. It is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us and/or individuals in our business in connection with investigations by the federal government. Other than as described in Note


to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, including those described in the aforementioned sections of this report, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and materially harm our reputation. See Note


to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding these and other matters.

Changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to the changes brought on by federal and state healthcare reform, including the ACA and any subsequent legislation, regulation or guidance, or what form many of these regulations will take before implementation.

For example, the ACA introduced healthcare insurance exchanges, which provide a marketplace for eligible individuals and small employers to purchase healthcare insurance. The business and regulatory environment continues to evolve as the exchanges mature, and statutes and regulations are challenged, changed and enforced. If commercial payor participation in the exchanges continues to decrease, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we cannot predict the short- or long-term effects of legislative or regulatory changes, we believe that future market changes could result in more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates or higher deductibles and co-payments that patients may not be able to pay. To the extent that changes in statutes, regulations or related guidance or changes in other market conditions result in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from commercial and/or government payors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The ACA also added several new tax provisions that, among other things, impose various fees and excise taxes, and limit compensation deductions for health insurance providers and their affiliates. These rules could negatively impact our cash flow and tax liabilities. In addition, the ACA broadened the potential for penalties under the FCA for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors and reduced the timeline to file Medicare claims. Failure to timely identify, quantify and return overpayments may result in significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. Failure to file a claim within the one year window could result in payment denials, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










will be passed. If such legislation is passed, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully provide integrated care on the broader scale contemplated by this legislation, and our costs of care could exceed our associated reimbursement rates. In general, if we are unable to efficiently adjust to these and other new models of care, it may erode our patient base or reimbursement rates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.



There have also been several state initiatives to limit payments to dialysis providers. For example, Proposition 8, a California statewide ballot initiative, was proposed by the Service Employees International Union - United Healthcare Workers West and sought to limit the amount of revenue dialysis providers can retain from caring for patients with commercial insurance by requiring rebates to insurers and taking into account only a portion of the costs incurred by dialysis providers. While Proposition 8 was not approved in the November 2018 election, we incurred substantial costs in our efforts to oppose Proposition 8. Ballot initiatives similar to Proposition 8 were also proposed in Ohio and Arizona; however, neither of these initiatives met the applicable requirements for inclusion on the state ballot for the November 2018 elections. Although Proposition 8 and the Ohio and Arizona initiatives did not pass, we expect that similar ballot initiatives or other legislation might be proposed in the future in these or other states.

Any law, rule or guidance proposed or issued by CMS or other federal or state regulatory or legislative authorities, including any initiatives similar to Proposition 8, SB 1156 or AB 290, described above, or other future ballot or other initiatives restricting or prohibiting the ability of patients with access to alternative coverage from selecting a marketplace plan on or off exchange, limiting the amount of revenue that a dialysis provider can retain for caring for patients with commercial insurance by, among other things, requiring rebates to insurers and taking into account only a portion of the costs incurred by dialysis providers, affecting payments made to providers for services provided to patients who receive charitable premium assistance and/or otherwise restricting or prohibiting the use of charitable premium assistance, could cause us to incur substantial costs to oppose any such proposed measures, impact our dialysis center development plans, and if passed and/or implemented, could adversely impact dialysis centers across the U.S. making certain centers economically unviable, lead to the closure of certain










centers, restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage, and in some cases, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or materially harm our reputation.

Data protection laws are evolving globally, and may add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our international operations. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to entities that are established in the European Union (EU), as well as extends the scope of EU data protection laws to foreign companies processing data of individuals in the EU. The GDPR imposes a comprehensive data protection regime with the potential for regulatory fines as well as data breach litigation by impacted data subjects. Under the GDPR, regulatory penalties may be assessed by data protection authorities for up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR and other new laws, regulations and policies implementing the GDPR may impact our European operations and/or limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services. If we fail to comply with the requirements of GDPR, we could be subject to penalties that would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Data protection laws are also evolving nationally, and may add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our U.S. operations. For example, the California legislature recently passed the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), which is scheduled to become effective January 1, 2020.  The CCPA is a privacy bill that requires certain companies doing business in California to disclose information regarding the collection and use of a consumer's personal data and to delete a consumer's data upon request.  The Act also permits the imposition of civil penalties and expands existing state security laws by providing a private right of action for consumers in certain circumstances where consumer data is subject to a breach. We are still evaluating whether and how this rule will impact our U.S. operations and /or limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services. In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) published a request for information (RFI) seeking public input on a broad range of potential reforms to HIPAA regulations with a focus on enhancing care coordination. Though only a preliminary step toward potential regulatory reform, the RFI’s scope is significant as OCR seeks potential modifications to the HIPAA regulations that would facilitate efficient care coordination while preserving the privacy and security of PHI.

Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state agents. Our business and operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks, including sensitive personal information, including PHI, social security numbers, and credit card information of our patients, teammates, physicians, business partners and others.

We continuously are implementing multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes and our people. We utilize security technologies designed to protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses and other malicious code; coordinated attacks by a variety of actors,










including activist entities or state sponsored cyberattacks; emerging cybersecurity risks; cyber risk related to connected devices; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events that could impact the security, reliability and availability of our systems. Internal or external parties may attempt to circumvent our security systems, and we have in the past, and expect that we will in the future, experience external attacks on our network including reconnaissance probes, denial of service attempts, malicious software attacks including ransomware or other attacks intended to render our internal operating systems or data unavailable, and phishing attacks or business email compromise. Cybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. As with any security program, there always exists the risk that employees will violate our policies despite our compliance efforts or that certain attacks may be beyond the ability of our security and other systems to detect. There can be no assurance that investments, diligence and/or our internal controls will be sufficient to prevent or timely discover an attack.

We may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business, and if businesses we acquire have liabilities we are not aware of or are not adequately addressed, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could materially harm our reputation.

Businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated, and may have other issues, including those related to internal controls over financial reporting or issues










that could affect our ability to comply with healthcare laws and regulations and other laws applicable to our expanded business, which could harm our reputation. As a result, we cannot make any assurances that the acquisitions we consummate will be successful. Although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. In addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits, the amounts held in escrow for our benefit (if any), or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. In the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification or alternative remedies that might be available to us, or any applicable insurance, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Additionally, joint ventures, including our Asia Pacific joint venture, and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may require us to make capital contributions or necessitate other payments, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, result in reputational harm to us or adversely affect the value of our investment or partnership. There can be no assurances that these joint ventures and/or minority investments, including our Asia Pacific joint venture, ultimately will be successful.

If we are unable to compete successfully, including implementing our growth strategy and/or retaining our physicians and patients, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, Fresenius USA, our largest competitor, manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers. This may give it cost advantages over us because of its ability to manufacture its own products or prevent us from accessing existing or new technology on a cost-effective basis. See further discussion regarding risks associated with our suppliers under the heading below, "If certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases on supplies, if we are not reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."

If we are not able to effectively implement our growth strategy, including by making acquisitions at the desired pace or at all; if we are not able to continue to maintain the expected or desired level of non-acquired growth; if we experience significant patient attrition as a result of new business activities, new technology or other forms of competition, reduced prevalence of ESRD or other reductions in demand for dialysis treatments; or if physicians choose not to refer to our clinics, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










If certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases on supplies, if we are not reimbursed or adequately reimbursed for drugs we purchase or if we are unable to effectively access new technology or superior products, it could negatively impact our ability to effectively provide the services we offer and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We have significant suppliers that may be the sole or primary source of products critical to the services we provide, or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases, sometimes at particular prices. If any of these suppliers do not meet our needs for the products they supply, including in the event of a product recall, shortage or dispute, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, if we experience material price increases from these suppliers that we are unable to mitigate, or if some of the drugs that we purchase are not reimbursed or not adequately reimbursed by commercial or government payors, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments which may result in superior products. If we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition and other negative consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG operates in a different line of business from our historical business, and we may not realize anticipated benefits from DMG.

DaVita Medical Group (DMG) operates in a different line of business from our historical business. We may not have the expertise, experience and resources to profitably pursue all of our businesses at once, and we may be unable to successfully and profitably operate all businesses in the combined company. The administration of DMG requires implementation of appropriate operations, management, forecasting, and financial reporting systems and controls, all of which pose challenges. The management of DMG requires and will continue to require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of its time and resources. The need for management to focus on these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If the DMG operations continue to be less profitable than we currently anticipate or we do not have the experience, the appropriate expertise or the resources to profitably pursue all businesses in the combined company, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.

Laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which DMG and our other subsidiaries are permitted to conduct their respective business, and the failure to comply with such laws could subject these entities to penalties or require a restructuring of these businesses.

Some states have laws that prohibit business entities, such as DMG and our other subsidiaries, including but not limited to, Nephrology Practice Solutions, DaVita Health Solutions, DaVita IKC, and Lifeline, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. Of the states in which DMG currently operates, California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington generally prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, and other states may as well.

DMG and other DaVita entities operate in those states by maintaining long-term contracts with their associated physician groups which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide physician services. Under these arrangements, DMG and such other DaVita entities provide non-medical management services and receive a management fee for providing these services; however, DMG and such other DaVita entities do not represent that they offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the associated physician groups.

In addition to the above management arrangements, DMG has certain contractual rights relating to the orderly transfer of equity interests in certain of its associated physician groups through succession agreements and other arrangements with their physician equity holders. However, such equity interests cannot be transferred to or held by DMG or by any non-professional organization. Accordingly, neither DMG nor DMG's subsidiaries directly own any equity interests in any physician groups in California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington. The other DaVita entities operating in these and multiple other states have similar agreements and arrangements. In the event that any of these associated physician groups fail to comply with the management arrangement or any management arrangement is terminated and/or DMG or any of the other DaVita entities is unable to enforce its contractual rights over the orderly transfer of equity interests in its associated physician groups, such events could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of DMG or such other DaVita entities.










It is possible that a state regulatory agency or a court could determine that DMG's agreements with physician equity holders of certain managed California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington associated physician groups and the way DMG carries out these arrangements as described above, either independently or coupled with the management services agreements with such associated physician groups, are in violation of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. As a result, these arrangements could be deemed invalid, potentially resulting in a loss of revenues and an adverse effect on results of operations derived from such associated physician groups. Such a determination could force a restructuring of DMG's management arrangements with associated physician groups in California, Colorado, Nevada and/or Washington, which might include revisions of the management services agreements, including a modification of the management fee and/or establishing an alternative structure that would permit DMG to contract with a physician network without violating the corporate practice of medicine prohibition. There can be no assurance that such a restructuring would be feasible, or that it could be accomplished within a reasonable time frame without a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These same risks exist for the other DaVita entities utilizing similar structures.

In December 2013, DaVita Health Plan of California, Inc. (DHPC) obtained a restricted Knox-Keene license in California, which, among other things, permits DHPC to contract with health plans in California and to arrange health care services through a network of employed or contracting physicians and other providerswithout violating the corporate practice of medicine prohibition. However, DHPC continues to subcontract with DMG associated physician groups in California to arrange physician services. DMG and DMG's California, Colorado, Nevada and Washington associated physician groups, as well as those physician equity holders of associated physician groups who are subject to succession agreements with DMG, could be subject to criminal or civil penalties or an injunction if, for non-physicians, they are found to be practicing medicine without a license or, for licensed physicians, they are found to be aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine.

The level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness and for other intended purposes depends on many factors beyond our control.

We have substantial debt outstanding, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt in connection with our entry into the Increase Joinder Agreement in March 2018, and we may continue to incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our substantial indebtedness and for other intended purposes, it could, for example:

•make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities;

•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, repurchases of stock at the levels intended or announced, or at all, and other general corporate purposes;

•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;

•expose us to interest rate volatility that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our ability to service our indebtedness;

•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to refinance existing debt on favorable terms when otherwise available.

In addition, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness in the future, and the amount of that additional indebtedness may be substantial. Although the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities include covenants that could limit our indebtedness, we currently have the ability to incur substantial additional debt. The related risks described in this risk factor could intensify, in particular, if there is a delay in closing the sale of DMG or the sale of DMG does not close, or if new debt is added to current debt levels. Further, the variable interest rates payable under our senior secured credit facilities are linked to LIBOR as the benchmark for establishing the rates. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted, but could adversely affect the variable interest rates payable under our senior secured credit facilities.










Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, to repurchase our stock at the levels intended or announced and to meet our other liquidity needs, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This depends not only on the success of our business but, to a certain extent, is also subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

If the pending sale of DMG closes, our cash flows will be reduced accordingly. We cannot provide assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs, including those described above. In that regard, approximately

$1.845 billion

of indebtedness under secured credit facilities will become due and payable in June 2019 at its stated maturity. Although we plan to seek replacement secured credit facilities to refinance that indebtedness as it becomes due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on terms we consider acceptable or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds to service our outstanding indebtedness or to meet our other liquidity needs, including the intended purposes described above, we would be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such indebtedness, sell assets, change or reduce our intended or announced uses or strategy for capital deployment, including for stock repurchases, reduce capital expenditures or planned expansions or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. In addition, if we are unable to refinance or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due and payable from time to time (including the approximate

$1.845 billion

of secured credit facilities indebtedness that becomes due in June 2019), we may seek waivers or extensions from the applicable lenders but there can be no assurance that those would be granted, in which case we would have to seek other sources of financing to repay that indebtedness, which might include sales of assets or equity securities or some of the other strategies discussed above. We cannot make any assurances that any such refinancing, restructurings, sales of assets, or issuances of equity can be accomplished, that any such waivers or extensions from lenders can be obtained or, if accomplished or obtained, will be on favorable terms or would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations or our other liquidity needs. Any failure to pay any of our indebtedness when due, including if we are unable to refinance the approximately

$1.845 billion

of indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities that becomes due in June 2019, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and could trigger cross default or cross acceleration provisions in our other debt instruments, thereby permitting the holders of that other indebtedness to demand immediate repayment, and, in the case of secured indebtedness, would generally permit the holders of that indebtedness to possess and sell the collateral to satisfy our obligations.

The borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and senior indentures are guaranteed by a substantial portion of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, including certain of DMG's subsidiaries, and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are secured by a substantial portion of our and our subsidiaries' assets, including those of certain of DMG's subsidiaries. If the pending sale of DMG closes, we will have fewer subsidiary guarantors of, and fewer assets with which to secure existing and future debt or refinance or restructure existing debt. This will likely reduce the total amount of secured debt that we will be able to incur and may increase the interest rate we are required to pay on our existing secured debt and any secured debt we issue in the future. In addition, by reducing the amount of assets available to meet the claims of our secured and other creditors and the number of subsidiary guarantors, it may also adversely affect the interest rates on our existing unsecured debt and any unsecured debt we issue in the future and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional unsecured debt.

For additional details regarding specific risks we face regarding the pending sale of DMG, see the discussion in the risk factors under the heading “Risk factors related to the sale of DMG.”

We may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance or exceed our existing insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

Our operations and how we manage our business may subject us, as well as our officers and directors to whom we owe certain defense and indemnity obligations, to litigation and liability for damages. Our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope or limits of coverage of any applicable insurance coverage, including claims related to adverse patient events, cybersecurity incidents, contractual disputes, professional and general liability and directors' and officers' duties. In addition, we have received notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties, as well as subpoenas and CIDs from the federal government, related to our business practices, including our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of acquired businesses. Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We maintain insurance coverage for those risks we deem are appropriate to insure against and make determinations about whether to self-insure as to other risks or layers of coverage. However, a successful claim, including a










professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim or a claim related to a cybersecurity incident, which is in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, or that is subject to our self-insurance retentions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. Additionally, as a result of the broad scope of our DMG division's medical practice, we are exposed to medical malpractice claims, as well as claims for damages and other expenses, that may not be covered by insurance or for which adequate limits of insurance coverage may not be available.

In addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. Market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:

•the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;

•further increases in premiums and deductibles;

•increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; or

•an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.

If we fail to successfully maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, our stock price and the market's perception of our business.

The integration of acquisitions and addition of new business lines into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and has increased and will continue to, increase our compliance costs. Failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, our stock price and the market's perception of our business. In addition, we could be required to restate our financial results in the event of a significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting or in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles.

Deterioration in economic conditions, disruptions in the financial markets or the effects of natural or other disasters or adverse weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Further, some of our operations, including our clinical laboratory, dialysis centers and other facilities, may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural or other disasters or adverse weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires or flooding. For example, our clinical laboratory is located in Florida, a state that has in the past experienced and may in the future experience hurricanes. Natural or other disasters or adverse weather events could significantly damage or destroy our facilities, disrupt operations, increase our costs to maintain operations and require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations.



Any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of these events, none of which we can currently predict, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










Disruptions in federal government operations and funding create uncertainty in our industry and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

A substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If the U.S. government defaults on its debt, there could be broad macroeconomic effects that could raise our cost of borrowing funds, and delay or prevent our future growth and expansion. Any future federal government shutdown, U.S. government default on its debt and/or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming regulatory developments.

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.

We are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable or favorable change in our overall tax provision.

From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the recent U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, represented a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code. We have completed our analysis of the initial impact of the 2017 federal tax law changes. However, it is possible that future guidance in connection with the law and/or the issuance of detailed regulations could impact our tax provision and cash taxes in future periods. Additionally, the legislation made significant changes to the tax rules applicable to insurance companies and other entities with which we do business. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our patients, business partners and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. We are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. For example, we are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 2014-2016. Although we believe our tax estimates and related reporting are appropriate, the final determination of this and other tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse development or outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the U.S. subjects us to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

We are continuing to expand our operations by offering our services and entering new lines of business in certain markets outside of the U.S., which increases our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. Depending on the market, these risks include those relating to:

•changes in the local economic environment;

•political instability, armed conflicts or terrorism;

•social changes;

•intellectual property legal protections and remedies;

•trade regulations;

•procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services;










•foreign currency;

•repatriating or moving to other countries cash generated or held abroad, including considerations relating to tax-efficiencies and changes in tax laws;

•export controls;

•lack of reliable legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;

•changes in local laws or regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof;

•potentially longer ramp-up times for starting up new operations and for payment and collection cycles;

•financial and operational, and information technology systems integration;

•failure to comply with U.S. laws, such as the FCPA, or local laws that prohibit us, our partners, or our partners' or our agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials or any third party for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business; and

•data and privacy restrictions.

Issues relating to the failure to comply with applicable non-U.S. laws, requirements or restrictions may also impact our domestic business and/or raise scrutiny on our domestic practices.

Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international business and operations will be different than those affecting our domestic business and operations. For example, conducting international operations requires us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with local laws and regulations, including to fulfill financial reporting requirements, and to overcome the numerous new challenges inherent in managing international operations, including those based on differing languages, cultures and regulatory environments, and those related to the timely hiring, integration and retention of a sufficient number of skilled personnel to carry out operations in an environment with which we are not familiar.

Any expansion of our international operations through acquisitions or through organic growth could increase these risks. Additionally, while we may invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, including to start up or acquire new operations, we may not be able to operate them profitably on the anticipated timeline, or at all.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

Risk factors related to the sale of DMG:

The announcement and pendency of the sale of DMG may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










Any continued delay in completing the sale of DMG or any additional modifications to the terms of the sale under the equity purchase agreement may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price.

The completion of the proposed sale of DMG is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”). On March 12, 2018, we received a request for additional information and documentary materials (commonly referred to as a “second request”) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) under the HSR Act in connection with the FTC’s review of the proposed sale of DMG. In connection with its approval of the proposed sale of DMG, the FTC may impose material conditions, terms and obligations, including making its approval subject to the disposition of certain assets, which could further delay completion of the transaction, or the FTC may impose conditions that would require an adverse modification to the equity purchase agreement. If further delays continue in completing the sale of DMG, or if the terms set forth in the equity purchase agreement are further amended, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be materially adversely affected.

If we fail to complete the proposed sale of DMG, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be materially adversely affected.

The completion of the proposed sale of DMG is subject to customary closing conditions, including FTC approval, and if any condition to the closing of the sale of DMG is neither satisfied nor, where permissible, waived, we may be unable to complete the disposition or complete the disposition on the terms set forth in the equity purchase agreement. In addition, either we or Optum may terminate the equity purchase agreement if, among other things, the sale has not been consummated prior to June 30, 2019. If the equity purchase agreement is terminated and our Board of Directors seeks an alternative transaction or another acquiror for the sale of the DMG business, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the equity purchase agreement with Optum, or at all. In the third and fourth quarters of 2018, we recognized valuation adjustments with respect to the DMG business based on an updated assessment of fair value, which includes inputs such as the transaction itself, risks and timing, and performance of the business, and we recorded associated goodwill impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2018. We may recognize additional valuation adjustments related to DMG in the future.

If the sale of DMG is not completed for any reason, investor confidence could decline. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity, protracted litigation, and may affect our relationships with teammates, patients, physicians, payors, suppliers, regulators and other business partners. In addition, in the event of a failed transaction, we will have expended significant management resources in an effort to complete the sale, and we will have incurred significant transaction costs, including legal fees, financial advisor fees and other related costs, without any commensurate benefit. Furthermore, we have incurred additional debt in anticipation of receiving the sale proceeds but there can be no assurances that we will receive the anticipated sale proceeds to repay such debt. Accordingly, if the proposed sale of DMG is not completed on the terms set forth in the equity purchase agreement or at all, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price may be materially adversely affected.

Our liquidity following the close of our pending sale of DMG and our planned subsequent entry into new external financing arrangements may be less than we anticipate, and we may use the proceeds from the pending sale of DMG and other available funds, including external financing and cash flow from operations, in ways that may not improve our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or enhance the value of our common stock.

The purchase price for the sale of the DMG business is subject to customary adjustments, both upward and downward,which could be significant. Following the closing of the pending DMG sale, we plan to use sale proceeds and other available funds, including from external financing and cash flow from operations, to repay debt, make significant stockrepurchases and for general corporate purposes, which may include growth investments. A number of factors may impact our ability torepurchase stock and the timing of any such stock repurchases, including market conditions, the price of our common stock, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, available financing, leverage ratios, and legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and restrictions. Accordingly, the actual amount of common stock we repurchase may be less, perhaps substantially, and the period of time over which we make any stock repurchases may be substantially longer, than we currently anticipate. In addition, we may identify investments or other uses for our available funds (other than the DMG sale proceeds that we plan to use to repay debt) that we believe are more attractive than our current intended uses. Further, there can be no assurance that any investment will yield a favorable return.










Under the terms of the equity purchase agreement, we are subject to certain contractual restrictions while the sale of DMG is pending that, in some cases, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Under the terms of the equity purchase agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of the DMG business prior to completing the sale of DMG, which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations have negatively affected and could continue to negatively affect our business and operations prior to the completion of the sale of DMG. Each of these risks may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the sale of DMG.

Risk factors related to our U.S. dialysis and related lab services, ancillary services and strategic initiatives:

If patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Approximately31%of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were generated from patients who have commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) as their primary payor. The majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than Medicare rates. The payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profit and all of our nonacute dialysis profits come from commercial payors. We continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general conditions in the market, including as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. In addition, many commercial payors that sell individual plans both on and off exchange have publicly announced losses in the marketplace. These payors may seek discounts on rates for marketplace plans on and off exchange. Commercial payment rates could be materially lower in the future.

A number of commercial payors have incorporated policies into their provider manuals limiting or refusing to accept charitable premium assistance from non-profit organizations, such as the American Kidney Fund, which may impact the number of patients who are able to afford commercial plans. Paying for coverage is a significant financial burden for many patients, and ESRD disproportionately affects the low-income population. Charitable premium assistance supports continuity of coverage and access to care for patients, many of whom are unable to continue working full-time as a result of their severe condition. A material restriction in patients' ability to access charitable premium assistance may restrict the ability of dialysis patients to obtain and maintain optimal insurance coverage, and may adversely impact a large number of dialysis centers across the U.S. by making certain centers economically unviable, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We also believe commercial payors have or will begin to restructure their benefits to create disincentives for patients to stay with commercial insurance or to select or remain with out-of-network providers. In addition, payors may seek to decrease payment rates for out-of-network providers. Decreases in the number of patients with commercial plans, decreases in out-of-network rates and restrictions on out-of-network access, our turning away new patients in instances where we are unable to come to agreement with commercial payors on rates, new business activities of commercial payors, or decreases in contracted rates could result in a significant decrease in our overall revenues derived from commercial payors. If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, or if we see a decline in commercial patients, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For additional details regarding specific risks










we face regarding regulatory changes that could result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "Changes in federal and state healthcare regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."

If the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Changes in the structure of and payment rates under the Medicare ESRD program could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Approximately44%of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were generated from patients who have Medicare as their primary payor. For patients with Medicare coverage, all ESRD payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment that are related to the treatment of dialysis, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers, such as erythropoietin (EPO), vitamin D analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed, except in the case of calcimimetics, which are subject to a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment for the Medicare Part B ESRD payment. Most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. Under the ESRD PPS, the bundled payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility's performance in specified quality measures set










annually by CMS through the ESRD Quality Incentive Program, which was established by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. The bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors. In addition, the ESRD PPS is subject to rebasing, which can have a positive financial effect, or a negative one if the government fails to rebase in a manner that adequately addresses the costs borne by dialysis facilities. Similarly, as new drugs, services or labs are added to the ESRD bundle, CMS' failure to adequately calculate the costs associated with the drugs, services or labs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The current bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks, which include:

•Risk that our rates are reduced by CMS. Uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business.

•Risk that CMS, through its contracted Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) or otherwise, implements Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) or other decisions that limit our ability to bill for treatments or other drugs and services or other rules that may impact reimbursement. Such coverage determinations could have an adverse impact on our revenue. There is also risk commercial insurers could seek to incorporate the requirements or limitations associated with such LCDs into their contracted terms with dialysis providers, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.

•Risk that a MAC, or multiple MACs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance; or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance.

•Risk that increases in our operating costs will outpace the Medicare rate increases we receive. We expect operating costs to continue to increase due to inflationary factors, such as increases in labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet changing regulatory requirements and business needs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in Medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.

•Risk of federal budget sequestration cuts. As a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the BBA, an annual 2% reduction to Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013, and has been extended through 2027. These across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

•Risk that failure to adequately develop and maintain our clinical systems or failure of our clinical systems to operate effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For example, in connection with claims for which at least part of the government's payments to us is based on clinical performance or patient outcomes or co-morbidities, if our clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to CMS or we otherwise have data integrity issues with respect to the reported information, we might be over-reimbursed by the government, which could subject us to liability. For example, CMS published a final rule that implemented a provision of the ACA, requiring providers to report and return Medicare and Medicaid overpayments within the later of (a) 60 days after the overpayment is identified and quantified, or (b) the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. An overpayment impermissibly retained under this statute could, among other things, subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs, and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute and could adversely impact our reputation.



We are subject to similar risks for services billed separately from the ESRD bundled payment, including the risk that a MAC, or multiple MACs, change their interpretations of existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance; or seek to implement or enforce new interpretations that are inconsistent with how we have interpreted existing regulations, manual provisions and/or guidance. For additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adhere to our Medicare and Medicaid regulatory compliance obligations, see the risk factor above under the heading "If we fail to adhere to all of the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price."










Changes in state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs or payment rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Approximately25%of our U.S. dialysis and related lab services net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were generated from patients who have state Medicaid or other non-Medicare government-based programs, such as coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as their primary coverage. As state governments and other governmental organizations face increasing budgetary pressure, we may in turn face reductions in payment rates, delays in the receipt of payments, limitations on enrollee eligibility or other changes to the applicable programs. For example, certain state Medicaid programs and the VA have recently considered, proposed or implemented payment rate reductions.

The VA adopted Medicare's bundled PPS pricing methodology for any veterans receiving treatment from non-VA providers under a national contracting initiative. Since we are a non-VA provider, these reimbursements are tied to a percentage of Medicare reimbursement, and we have exposure to any dialysis reimbursement changes made by CMS. Approximately3%of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were generated by the VA.

In 2013, we entered into a five-year Nationwide Dialysis Services contract with the VA which is subject to one-year renewal periods, consistent with all provider agreements with the VA under this contract. During the length of the contract, the VA has elected not to make adjustments to reimbursement percentages that are tied to a percentage of Medicare reimbursement rates. These agreements provide the VA with the right to terminate the agreements without cause on short notice. Should the VA renegotiate, or not renew or cancel these agreements for any reason, we may cease accepting patients under this program and may be forced to close centers or experience lower reimbursement rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

State Medicaid programs are increasingly adopting Medicare-like bundled payment systems, but sometimes these payment systems are poorly defined and are implemented without any claims processing infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters. If these payment systems are implemented without any adjusters and claims processing infrastructure, Medicaid payments will be substantially reduced and the costs to submit such claims may increase, which will have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, some state Medicaid program eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in such programs provide documented proof of citizenship. If our patients cannot meet these proof of citizenship documentation requirements, they may be denied coverage under these programs, resulting in decreased patient volumes and revenue. These Medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar changes to other non-Medicare government programs could reduce the rates paid by these programs for dialysis and related services, delay the receipt of payment for services provided and further limit eligibility for coverage which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting pharmaceuticals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and negatively impact our ability to care for patients.

Medicare bundles certain pharmaceuticals into the PPS at industry average doses and prices. Any variation above the industry average may be subject to partial reimbursement through the PPS outlier reimbursement policy.

Commercial payors have increasingly examined their administration policies for pharmaceuticals and, in some cases, have modified those policies. Changes in labeling of pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns, including their independent determinations as to appropriate dosing, or accepted clinical practices, and/or changes in private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of administration policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further increased utilization of certain pharmaceuticals for patients for whom the cost of which is included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or further decreases in reimbursement for pharmaceuticals that are not included in a bundled reimbursement rate, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, calcimimetics became part of the Medicare Part B ESRD payment, but subject to a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment.  We implemented processes designed to provide the drug as required under the applicable regulations and prescribed by physicians and have entered into agreements to provide for access to and distribution of the drug.  If payors do not pay as anticipated, if we are not adequately reimbursed for the cost of the drug, or the processes we have implemented to provide the drug do not perform as anticipated, then we could be subject to both financial and operational risk, among other things.

We may be subject to increased inquiries or audits from a variety of governmental bodies or claims by third parties related to pharmaceuticals, which would require management's attention and could result in significant legal expense. Any










negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties or repayment obligations, the imposition of certain obligations on and changes to our practices and procedures as well as the attendant financial burden on us to comply with the obligations, or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

If we fail to comply with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

Delays in state Medicare and Medicaid certification or other licensing and/or anything impacting the licensing of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










If our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As of December 31, 2018, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis-related joint ventures, which represented approximately

25%

There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of dialysis revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize, and if our estimates of revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition or have a material adverse effect on our business,resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows.

There are significant risks associated with estimating the amount of U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize in a reporting period. The billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payor issues, such as ensuring appropriate documentation. Determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for approximately

202,700



U.S. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. Errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. Revenues associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. Collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. We generally expect our range of U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of net revenues for the segment. If our estimates of U.S. dialysis and related lab services revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations, that we operate or invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs.

$11 million

and incurred asset impairment charges of

$17 million

related to the restructuring of our pharmacy business.

If any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our international operations, are unsuccessful, it would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we may determine to exit










that line of business. We could incur significant termination costs if we were to exit certain of these lines of business. In addition, we may incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives. In that regard, we have taken, and may in the future take, impairment and restructuring charges in addition to those described above related to our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including in our international and pharmacy businesses.

If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Physicians, including medical directors, choose where they refer their patients. Some physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. As a result, referral sources for many of our centers include the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center.

Our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally ten years, and at any given time a large number of them could be up for renewal at the same time. Medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us and, under certain circumstances, our former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. Neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers.

The aging of the nephrologist population and opportunities presented by our competitors may negatively impact a medical director's decision to enter into or extend his or her agreement with us. Moreover, different affiliation models in the changing healthcare environment that limit a nephrologist's choice in where he or she can refer patients, such as an increase in the number of physicians becoming employed by hospitals or a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers, may limit a nephrologist's ability or desire to refer patients to our centers or otherwise negatively impact treatment volumes.

In addition, if the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which would lead to the early termination of the agreement. If we are unable to obtain qualified medical directors to provide supervision of the operations and care provided at our dialysis centers, it could affect physicians' desire to refer patients to our dialysis centers. If a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

If our labor costs continue to rise, including due to shortages, changes in certification requirements and higher than normal turnover rates in skilled clinical personnel; or currently pending or future rules, regulations or initiatives impose additional requirements or limitations on our operations or profitability; or, if we are unable to attract and retain key leadership talent, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We face increasing labor costs generally, and in particular, we face increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. We compete for nurses with hospitals and other healthcare providers. This nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. Furthermore, changes in certification requirements can impact our ability to maintain sufficient staff levels, including to the extent our teammates are not able to meet new requirements, among other things. In addition, if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth may be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also face competition in attracting and retaining talent for key leadership positions. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, we may experience disruptions in our business operations, including our ability to achieve strategic goals, which could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to challenge and prepare for and, if implemented, impose additional requirements on our operations, including increases in the required staffing levels or staffing ratios for clinical personnel, minimum transition times between treatments, limits on how much patients may be charged for care, limitations as to the amount that can be spent on certain medical costs, and limitations on the amount of revenue that providers can retain. Changes such as those mandated by proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating expense and impact our ability to staff our clinics to any new, elevated staffing levels, in particular given the ongoing










nationwide shortage of healthcare workers, especially nurses. Any of these events or circumstances could materially reduce our revenues and increase our operating and other costs, require us to close or consolidate existing dialysis centers, postpone or not build new dialysis centers, reduce shifts or negatively impact employee relations, treatment growth and productivity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For additional information on these risks, see "Changes in federal and state health regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows."

Our business is labor intensive and could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees or if union organizing activities or legislative or other changes result in significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.

Our business is labor intensive, and our financial and operating results have been and continue to be subject to variations in labor-related costs, productivity and the number of pending or potential claims against us related to labor and employment practices. Political or other efforts at the national or local level could result in actions or proposals that increase the likelihood or success of union organizing activities at our facilities and ongoing union organizing activities at our facilities could continue or increase for other reasons. We could experience an upward trend in wages and benefits and labor and employment claims, including the filing of class action suits, or adverse outcomes of such claims, or face work stoppages. In addition, we are and may continue to be subject to targeted corporate campaigns by union organizers in response to which we have been and may continue to be required to expend substantial resources, both time and financial. Any of these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our employee relations, treatment growth, productivity, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Complications associated with our billing and collections system could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our billing system is critical to our billing operations. If there are defects in the billing system, we may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered, including a delay in collections, a reduction in the amounts collected, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance with reimbursement regulations, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Risk factors primarily related to DMG:

DMG is subject to many of the same risks to which our dialysis business is subject.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, DMG is subject to many of the same risks as our dialysis business is, as described in the risk factors set forth above in this Part I, Item 1A, many of which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Under most of DMG's agreements with health plans, DMG assumes some or all of the risk that the cost of providing services will exceed its compensation.

Approximately

84%










agreements during their then-current terms and could, directly or indirectly through its contracts with its associated physician groups, suffer losses with respect to such agreements.

Changes in DMG's or its associated physician groups' anticipated ratio of medical expense to revenue can significantly impact DMG's financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control medical costs and expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported claims, could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Historically, DMG's and its associated physician groups' medical costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue have fluctuated. Factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed estimates include:

•the health status of members;

•higher than expected utilization of new or existing healthcare services or technologies;

•an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise;

•changes to mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices;

•periodic renegotiation of provider contracts with specialist physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers;

•periodic renegotiation of contracts with DMG's affiliated primary care physicians and specialists;

•changes in the demographics of the participating members and medical trends;

•contractual or claims disputes with providers, hospitals or other service providers within and outside of a health plan's network;

•the occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics or acts of terrorism; and

•the reduction of health plan premiums.

Risk-sharing arrangements that DMG and its associated physician groups have with health plans and hospitals could result in their costs exceeding the corresponding revenues, which could reduce or eliminate any shared risk profitability.

Renegotiation, renewal or termination of capitation agreements with health plans could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Under most of DMG's and its associated physician groups' capitation agreements with health plans, the health plan is generally permitted to modify the benefit and risk obligations and compensation rights from time to time during the terms of the agreements. If a health plan exercises its right to amend its benefit and risk obligations and compensation rights, DMG and its associated physician groups are generally allowed a period of time to object to such amendment. If DMG or its associated physician group so objects, under some of the risk agreements, the relevant health plan may terminate the applicable agreement upon 90 to 180 days written notice. If DMG or its associated physician groups enter into capitation contracts or other risk










sharing arrangements with unfavorable economic terms, or a capitation contract is amended to include unfavorable terms, DMG could, directly or indirectly through its contracts with its associated physician groups, suffer losses with respect to such contract. Since DMG does not negotiate with CMS or any health plan regarding the benefits to be provided under their Medicare Advantage plans, DMG often has just a few months to familiarize itself with each new annual package of benefits it is expected to offer. Depending on the health plan at issue and the amount of revenue associated with the health plan's risk agreement, the renegotiated terms or termination could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

If DMG's agreements or arrangements with any physician equity holder(s) of associated physicians, physician groups or independent practice associations (IPAs) are deemed invalid under state law, including laws against the corporate practice of medicine, or federal law, or are terminated as a result of changes in state law, or if there is a change in accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the interpretation thereof affecting consolidation of entities, it could have a material adverse effect on DMG's consolidation of total revenues derived from such associated physician groups.

DMG's financial statements are consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting standards and include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries and certain non-owned DMG-associated and managed physician groups. Such consolidation for accounting and/or tax purposes does not, is not intended to, and should not be deemed to, imply or provide to DMG any control over the medical or clinical affairs of such physician groups. In the event of a change in accounting standards promulgated by FASB or in interpretation of its standards, or if there is an adverse determination by a regulatory agency or a court, or a change in state or federal law relating to the ability to maintain present agreements or arrangements with such physician groups, DMG may not be permitted to continue to consolidate the total revenues of such organizations. A change in accounting for consolidation with respect to DMG's present agreements or arrangements would diminish DMG's reported revenues but would not be expected to materially and adversely affect its reported results of operations, while regulatory or legal rulings or changes in law interfering with DMG's ability to maintain its present agreements or arrangements could materially diminish both revenues and results of operations.

If DHPC is not able to satisfy financial solvency or other regulatory requirements, wecould become subject to sanctions and its license to do business in California could be limited, suspended or terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Knox-Keene requires healthcare service plans operating in California to comply with financial solvency and other requirements overseen by the California Department of Managed HealthCare (DMHC). Under Knox-Keene, DHPC is required to, among other things:

•Maintain, at all times, a minimum tangible net equity (TNE);

•Submit periodic financial solvency reports to the DMHC containing various data regarding performance and financial solvency;

•Comply with extensive regulatory requirements; and

•Submit to periodic regulatory audits and reviews concerning DHPC operations and compliance with Knox-Keene.

In the event that DHPC is not in compliance with the provisions of Knox-Keene, we could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or suspension of its license to do business in California, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

If DMG's associated physician group is not able to satisfy the California DMHC's financial solvency requirements, DMG's associated physician group could become subject to sanctions and DMG's ability to do business in California could be limited or terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The California DMHC has instituted financial solvency regulations to monitor the financial solvency of capitated physician groups. Under these regulations, DMG's associated physician group is required to, among other things:

•Maintain, at all times, a minimum cash-to-claims ratio (where cash-to-claims ratio means the organization's cash, marketable securities and certain qualified receivables, divided by the organization's total unpaid claims liability). The regulation currently requires a cash-to-claims ratio of 0.75.










•Submit periodic reports to the California DMHC containing various data and attestations regarding performance and financial solvency, including incurred but not reported calculations and documentation, and attestations as to whether or not the organization was in compliance with Knox-Keene requirements related to claims payment timeliness, had maintained positive TNE (i.e., at least $1.00) and had maintained positive working capital (i.e., at least $1.00).

In the event that DMG's associated physician group is not in compliance with any of the above criteria, DMG's associated physician group could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or termination of, its ability to do business in California, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Reductions in Medicare Advantage health plan reimbursement rates stemming from healthcare reforms and any future related regulations could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

A significant portion of DMG's revenue is directly or indirectly derived from the monthly premium payments paid by CMS to health plans for medical services provided to Medicare Advantage enrollees. As a result, DMG's results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for Medicare Advantage programs. Any changes that limit or reduce Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, such as reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under programs, reductions in funding of programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under programs, could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Each year, CMS issues a final rule to establish the Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates for the following calendar year. Any reduction to Medicare Advantage rates impacting DMG that is greater compared to the industry average rate may have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The final impact of the Medicare Advantage rates can vary from any estimate we may have and may be further impacted by the relative growth of DMG's Medicare Advantage patient volumes across markets as well as by the benefit plan designs submitted. It is possible that we may underestimate the impact of the Medicare Advantage rates on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG's Medicare Advantage revenues may continue to be volatile in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










The ACA contains a number of provisions that negatively impact Medicare Advantage plans, each of which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These provisions include the following:

•Medicare Advantage benchmarks for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. From 2012 through 2016, Medicare Advantage benchmark rates were phased down from prior levels. The new benchmarks were fully phased-in in 2017 and range between 95% and 115% of the Medicare Fee-for-Service (Medicare FFS) costs, depending on a plan's geographic area. If our costs escalate faster than can be absorbed by the level of revenues implied by these benchmark rates, then it could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business and results of operations.

•Rebates received by Medicare Advantage plans that were reduced, with larger reductions for plans failing to receive certain quality ratings.

•The Secretary of the HHS has been granted the explicit authority to deny Medicare Advantage plan bids that propose significant increases in cost sharing or decreases in benefits. If the bids submitted by plans contracted with DMG are denied, this could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business and results of operations.

•Medicare Advantage plans with medical loss ratios below 85% are required to pay a rebate to the Secretary of HHS. The rebate amount is the total revenue under the contract year multiplied by the difference between 85% and the plan's actual medical loss ratio. The Secretary of HHS will halt enrollment in any plan failing to meet this ratio for three consecutive years, and terminate any plan failing to meet the ratio for five consecutive years. If a DMG-contracting Medicare Advantage plan experiences a limitation on enrollment or is otherwise terminated from the Medicare Advantage program, it could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business and results of operations.

•Prescription drug plans are required to provide coverage of certain drug categories on a list developed by the Secretary of HHS, which could increase the cost of providing care to Medicare Advantage enrollees, and thereby reduce DMG's revenues and earnings. The Medicare Part D premium amount subsidized for high-income beneficiaries has been reduced, which could lower the number of Medicare Advantage enrollees, which would have a negative impact on DMG's business and results of operations.

•CMS increased coding intensity adjustments for Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2019, which reduces CMS payments to Medicare Advantage plans, which in turn will likely reduce the amounts payable to DMG and its associated physicians, physician groups, and IPAs under its capitation agreements.

Recent legislative, judicial and executive efforts to enact further healthcare reform legislation have caused the future state of the exchanges, other ACA reforms, and many core aspects of the current U.S. health care system to be unclear. While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, enacted reforms and future legislative, regulatory, judicial, or executive changes could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

There is also uncertainty regarding both Medicare Advantage payment rates and beneficiary enrollment, which, if reduced, would reduce DMG's overall revenues and net income. For example, although the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted in 2010 that Medicare Advantage participation would drop substantially by 2020, the CBO has more recently predicted, without taking into account potential future reforms, that enrollment in Medicare Advantage (and other contracts covering Medicare Parts A and B) could reach 31 million by 2027. Although Medicare Advantage enrollment increased by approximately 5.6 million, or by 50%, between the enactment of the ACA in 2010 and 2015, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. Further, fluctuation in Medicare Advantage payment rates are evidenced by CMS's annual announcement of the expected average change in revenue from the prior year: for 2018, CMS announced an average increase of 0.45%; and for 2019, 3.4%. Uncertainty over Medicare Advantage enrollment and payment rates present a continuing risk to DMG's business.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Medicare Advantage enrollment continues to be highly concentrated among a few payors, both nationally and in local regions. In 2018, the KFF reported that three payors together accounted for more than half of Medicare Advantage enrollment and seven firms accounted for approximately 75% of the lives. Consolidation among Medicare Advantage plans in certain regions, or the Medicare program's failure to attract additional plans to participate in the Medicare Advantage program, could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.










DMG's operations are dependent on competing health plans and, at times, a health plan's and DMG's economic interests may diverge.

For the year ended December 31, 2018,69%of DMG's consolidated capitated medical revenues were earned through contracts with three health plans.

DMG expects that, going forward, substantially all of its revenue will continue to be derived from its contracts with health plans. Each health plan may immediately terminate any of DMG's contracts and/or any individual credentialed physician upon the occurrence of certain events. They may also amend the material terms of the contracts under certain circumstances. Failure to maintain the contracts on favorable terms, for any reason, would materially and adversely affect DMG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A material decline in the number of members could also have a material adverse effect on DMG's results of operations.

DMG and its associated physicians, physician groups and IPAs and other physicians may be required to continue providing services following termination of certain agreements with health plans.

There are circumstances under federal and state law pursuant to which DMG and its associated physician groups, IPAs and other physicians could be obligated to continue to provide medical services to DMG members in their care following a termination of their applicable risk agreement with health plans and termination of the receipt of payments thereunder. In certain cases, this obligation could require the physician group or IPA to provide care to such member following the bankruptcy or insolvency of a health plan. Accordingly, the obligations to provide medical services to DMG members (and the associated costs) may not terminate at the time the applicable agreement with the health plan terminates, and DMG may not be able to recover its cost of providing those services from the health plan, which could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG operates primarily in California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington and Colorado and may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions.

DMG derives substantially all of its revenue from operations in California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Washington and Colorado (which we refer to as the Existing Geographic Regions). As a result, DMG's exposure to many of the risks described herein is not mitigated by a greater diversification of geographic focus. Furthermore, due to the concentration of DMG's operations in the Existing Geographic Regions, it may be adversely affected by economic conditions, natural disasters (such as earthquakes or hurricanes), or acts of war or terrorism that disproportionately affect the Existing Geographic Regions as compared to other states and geographic markets.

To expand the operations of its network outside of the Existing Geographic Regions, DMG must devote resources to identify and explore perceived opportunities. Thereafter, DMG must, among other things, recruit and retain qualified personnel, develop new offices, establish potential new relationships with one or more health plans, and establish new relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers. The ability to establish such new relationships may be significantly inhibited by competition for such relationships and personnel in the healthcare marketplace in the targeted new geographic regions. Additionally, DMG may face the risk that a substantial portion of the patients served in a new geographic area may be enrolled










in a Medicare FFS program and will not desire to transition to a Medicare Advantage program, such as those offered through the health plans that DMG serves, or they may enroll with other health plans with which DMG does not contract to receive services, which could reduce substantially DMG's perceived opportunity in such geographic area. In addition, if DMG were to seek to expand outside of the Existing Geographic Regions, DMG would be required to comply with laws and regulations of states that may differ from the ones in which it currently operates, and could face competitors with greater knowledge of such local markets. DMG anticipates that any geographic expansion may require it to make a substantial investment of management time, capital and/or other resources. There can be no assurance that DMG will be able to establish profitable operations or relationships in any new geographic markets.

Reductions in the quality ratings of the health plans DMG serves could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As a result of the ACA, the level of reimbursement each health plan receives from CMS is dependent, in part, upon the quality rating of the Medicare plan. Such ratings impact the percentage of any cost savings rebate and any bonuses earned by such health plan. Since a significant portion of DMG's revenue is expected to be calculated as a percentage of CMS reimbursements received by these health plans with respect to DMG members, reductions in the quality ratings of a health plan that DMG serves could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Given each health plan's control of its plans and the many other providers that serve such plans, DMG believes that it will have limited ability to influence the overall quality rating of any such plan. The BBA passed in February 2018 implements certain changes to prevent artificial inflation of star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans offered by the same organization. In addition, CMS has terminated plans that have had a rating of less than three stars for three consecutive years, whereas Medicare Advantage plans with five stars are permitted to conduct enrollment throughout almost the entire year. Because low quality ratings can potentially lead to the termination of a plan that DMG serves, DMG may not be able to prevent the potential termination of a contracting plan or a shift of patients to other plans based upon quality issues which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG's records and submissions to a health plan may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members, which could cause DMG to overstate or understate its revenue and subject it to various penalties.

DMG, on behalf of itself and its associated physicians, physician groups and IPAs, submits to health plans claims and encounter data that support the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (RAF) scores attributable to members. These RAF scores determine, in part, the revenue to which the health plans and, in turn, DMG is entitled for the provision of medical care to such members. The data submitted to CMS by each health plan is based, in part, on medical charts and diagnosis codes prepared and submitted by DMG. Each health plan generally relies on DMG and its employed or affiliated physicians to appropriately document and support such RAF data in DMG's medical records. Each health plan also relies on DMG and its employed or affiliated physicians to appropriately code claims for medical services provided to members. Erroneous claims and erroneous encounter records and submissions could result in inaccurate PMPM fee revenue and risk adjustment payments, which may be subject to correction or retroactive adjustment in later periods. This corrected or adjusted information may be reflected in financial statements for periods subsequent to the period in which the revenue was recorded. DMG might also need to refund a portion of the revenue that it received, which refund, depending on its magnitude, could damage its relationship with the applicable health plan and could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In September 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and OIG to resolve matters related to our and our subsidiaries' (including DMG and its subsidiary JSA) provision of services to Medicare Advantage plans and related patient diagnosis coding and risk adjustment submissions and payments. See Note17to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details and discussions of legal proceedings elsewhere in these Risk Factors.

Additionally, CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members chosen at random. The Medicare Advantage plans ask providers to submit the underlying documentation for members that they serve. It is possible that claims associated with members with higher RAF scores could be subject to more scrutiny in a CMS or plan audit. There is a possibility that a Medicare Advantage plan may seek repayment from DMG should CMS make any payment adjustments to the Medicare Advantage plan as a result of its audits. The plans also may hold DMG liable for any penalties owed to CMS for inaccurate or unsupportable RAF scores provided by DMG. In addition, DMG could be liable for penalties to the government under the FCA that range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. On January 29, 2018, the DOJ issued a final rule announcing










adjustments to FCA penalties, under which the per claim penalty range increases to a range from $11,181 to $22,363 for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.

CMS has indicated that payment adjustments will not be limited to RAF scores for the specific Medicare Advantage enrollees for which errors are found but may also be extrapolated to the entire Medicare Advantage plan subject to a particular CMS contract. CMS has described its audit process as plan-year specific and stated that it will not extrapolate audit results for plan years prior to 2011. Because CMS has not stated otherwise, there is a risk that payment adjustments made as a result of one plan year's audit would be extrapolated to prior plan years after 2011.

There can be no assurance that a health plan will not be randomly selected or targeted for review by CMS or that the outcome of such a review will not result in a material adjustment in DMG's revenue and profitability, even if the information DMG submitted to the plan is accurate and supportable.

A failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical expense could adversely affect DMG's results of operations.

Patient care costs include estimates of future medical claims that have been incurred by the patient but for which the provider has not yet billed DMG. These claim estimates are made utilizing actuarial methods and are continually evaluated and adjusted by management, based upon DMG's historical claims experience and other factors, including an independent assessment by a nationally recognized actuarial firm. Adjustments, if necessary, are made to medical claims expense and capitated revenues when the assumptions used to determine DMG's claims liability change and when actual claim costs are ultimately determined.

Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the factors used in these estimates and changes in the patterns and rates of medical utilization, materially different amounts could be reported in DMG's financial statements for a particular period under different conditions or using different, but still reasonable, assumptions. It is possible that DMG's estimates of this type of claim may be inadequate in the future. In such event, DMG's results of operations could be adversely impacted. Further, the inability to estimate these claims accurately may also affect DMG's ability to take timely corrective actions, further exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on DMG's results of operations.

DMG faces certain competitive threats which could reduce DMG's profitability and increase competition for patients.

DMG faces certain competitive threats based on certain features of the Medicare programs, including the following:

•As a result of the direct and indirect impacts of the ACA, many Medicare beneficiaries may decide that an original Medicare FFS program is more attractive than a Medicare Advantage plan. As a result, enrollment in the health plans DMG serves may decrease.

•Managed care companies offer alternative products such as regional preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and private FFS plans. Medicare PPOs and private FFS plans allow their patients more flexibility in selecting physicians than Medicare Advantage health plans, which typically require patients to coordinate care with a primary care physician. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 has encouraged the creation of regional PPOs through various incentives, including certain risk corridors, or cost reimbursement provisions, a stabilization fund for incentive payments, and special payments to hospitals not otherwise contracted with a Medicare Advantage plan that treat regional plan enrollees. The formation of regional Medicare PPOs and private FFS plans may affect DMG's relative attractiveness to existing and potential Medicare patients in their service areas.

•The payments for the local and regional Medicare Advantage plans are based on a competitive bidding process that may indirectly cause a decrease in the amount of the PMPM fee or result in an increase in benefits offered.

•The annual enrollment process and subsequent lock-in provisions of the ACA may adversely affect DMG's level of revenue growth as it will limit the ability of a health plan to market to and enroll new Medicare beneficiaries in its established service areas outside of the annual enrollment period.

•CMS allows Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan with a quality rating of 4.5 stars or less to enroll in a 5-star rated Medicare Advantage plan at any time during the benefit year. Therefore, DMG may face a competitive disadvantage in recruiting and retaining Medicare beneficiaries.

In addition to the competitive threats intrinsic to the Medicare programs, competition among health plans and among healthcare providers may also have a negative impact on DMG's profitability. For example, due to the large population of










Medicare beneficiaries, DMG's Existing Geographic Regions have become increasingly attractive to health plans that may compete with DMG. DMG may not be able to continue to compete profitably in the healthcare industry if additional competitors enter the same market. If DMG cannot compete profitably, the ability of DMG to compete with other service providers that contract with competing health plans may be substantially impaired. Furthermore, if DMG is unable to obtain new members or experiences a loss of existing members to competitors during the open enrollment period for Medicare it could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG competes directly with various regional and local companies that provide similar services in DMG's Existing Geographic Regions. DMG's competitors vary in size and scope and in terms of products and services offered. DMG believes that some of its competitors and potential competitors may be significantly larger than DMG and have greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources. Furthermore, it is DMG's belief that some of its competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves.

A disruption in DMG's healthcare provider networks could have a material adverse effect on DMG's operations and profitability.

In any particular service area, healthcare providers or provider networks could refuse to contract with DMG, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, disruption of benefits to DMG's members, or difficulty in meeting applicable regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some service areas, healthcare providers or provider networks may have significant market positions. If healthcare providers or provider networks refuse to contract with DMG, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts, or place DMG at a competitive disadvantage, then DMG's ability to market or to be profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. DMG's provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large provider group. Any disruption in DMG's provider networks could result in a loss of members or higher healthcare costs.

DMG's revenues and profits could be diminished if DMG fails to retain and attract the services of key primary care physicians.

Key primary care physicians with large patient enrollment could retire, become disabled, terminate their provider contracts, get lured away by a competing independent physician association or medical group, or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or continue contracting with DMG or its associated physicians, physician groups or IPAs. In addition, DMG's associated physicians, physician groups and IPAs could view the business model as unfavorable or unattractive to such providers, which could cause such associated physicians, physician groups or IPAs to terminate their relationships with DMG. Moreover, given limitations relating to the enforcement of post-termination noncompetition covenants in California, it would be difficult to restrict a primary care physician from competing with DMG's associated physicians, physician groups or IPAs. As a result, members who have been served by such physicians could choose to enroll with competitors' physician organizations or could seek medical care elsewhere, which could reduce DMG's revenues and profits. Moreover, DMG may not be able to attract new physicians to replace the services of terminating physicians or to service its growing membership.

Participation in ACO programs is subject to federal regulation, supervision, and evolving regulatory developments that may result in financial liability.

The ACA established the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) for ACOs, which took effect in January 2012. Under the MSSP, eligible organizations are accountable for the quality, cost and overall care of Medicare beneficiaries assigned to an ACO and may be eligible to share in any savings below a specified benchmark amount. The Secretary of HHS is also authorized, but not required, to use capitation payment models with ACOs. CMS has also implemented the Next Generation ACO model, which allows the ACO to assume higher levels of financial risk and reward than under the MSSP program. DMG has formed an MSSP ACO through a subsidiary in New Mexico and a Next Generation ACO (previously an MSSP ACO) through a subsidiary in California, and is evaluating whether to participate in more ACOs in the future. The continued development and expansion of ACOs, and potential changes to the participation requirements in ACOs, will have an uncertain impact on DMG's revenue and profitability. DaVita Kidney Care is also participating as a dialysis provider in Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania for the Innovation Center's CEC Model. Further, in December 2018, CMS issued a final rule for the MSSP, which among other things, requires ACOs to accept a two-sided risk model (as opposed to a one-sided model), wherein ACOs need to share in the financial risk of their patients' healthcare spending (

i.e.

, shared losses) in addition to shared savings. This rule could negatively impact the revenue and profitability of DMG's MSSP ACO.

The ACO programs are relatively new and therefore operational and regulatory guidance is limited. It is possible that the operations of DMG's subsidiary ACOs may not fully comply with current or future regulations and guidelines applicable to ACOs, may not achieve quality targets or cost savings, or may not attract or retain sufficient physicians or patients to allow










DMG to meet its objectives. Additionally, poor performance could put the DMG ACOs at financial risk with a potential obligation to CMS. Traditionally, other than fee-for-service billing by the medical clinics and healthcare facilities offered by DMG, DMG has not directly contracted with CMS and has not operated any health plans or provider sponsored networks. Therefore, DMG may not have the necessary experience, systems or compliance to successfully achieve a positive return on its investment in the ACOs or to avoid financial or regulatory liability. DMG believes that its historical experience with fully delegated managed care will be applicable to operation of its subsidiary ACOs, but there can be no such assurance.

California hospitals may terminate their agreements with HealthCare Partners Affiliates Medical Group and DaVita Health Plan of California, Inc. (formerly HealthCare Partners Plan, Inc., and, together with HealthCare Partners Affiliates Medical Group (AMG)) or reduce the fees they pay to DMG.

In California, AMG maintains significant hospital arrangements designed to facilitate the provision of coordinated hospital care with those services provided to members by AMG and its associated physicians, physician groups and IPAs. Through contractual arrangements with certain key hospitals, AMG provides utilization review, quality assurance and other management services related to the provision of patient care services to members by the contracted hospitals and downstream hospital contractors. In the event that any one of these key hospital agreements is amended in a financially unfavorable manner or is otherwise terminated, such events could have a significant adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG's professional liability and other insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover DMG's potential liabilities.

DMG maintains primary professional liability insurance and other insurance coverage through California Medical Group Insurance Company, Risk Retention Group, an Arizona corporation in which DMG is the majority owner, and through excess coverage contracted through third-party insurers. DMG believes such insurance is adequate based on its review of what it believes to be all applicable factors, including industry standards. Nonetheless, potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations, the amount of insurance coverage and/or related reserves may be inadequate, or the amount of any DMG self-insured retention may be substantial. There can be no assurances that DMG will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost-effective basis, if at all. Moreover, even if claims brought against DMG are unsuccessful or without merit, DMG would have to defend itself against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly and may distract DMG management's attention. As a result, DMG may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate its business.

Changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements may materially adversely affect DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Any negative changes in governmental capitation or FFS rates or methods of reimbursement for the services DMG provides could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Since governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, DMG generally cannot increase its revenues from these programs by increasing the amount it charges for its services. Moreover, if DMG's costs increase, DMG may not be able to recover its increased costs from these programs. Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and delivery of healthcare services due to budgetary constraints, and cost containment pressures as well as other financial issues. DMG believes that these trends in cost containment will continue. These cost containment measures, and other market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted DMG's ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, any increased costs that DMG experiences. DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by these cost containment measures, and other market changes.

DMG's business model depends on numerous complex management information systems and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm DMG's operations and result in potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.

DMG depends on a complex, specialized, and integrated management information system and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for DMG's billing operations. DMG may experience unanticipated delays, complications or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating these integrated systems. Moreover, DMG may be unable to enhance its existing management information system or implement new management information systems where necessary. DMG's management information system may require modifications, improvements or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. DMG's ability to implement and operate its integrated systems is subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist DMG in creating and maintaining these systems.










DMG's failure to successfully implement and maintain all of its systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For example, DMG's failure to successfully operate its billing systems could lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations. If DMG is unable to handle its claims volume, or if DMG is unable to pay claims timely, DMG may become subject to a health plan's corrective action plan or de-delegation until the problem is corrected, and/or termination of the health plan's agreement with DMG. This could have a material adverse effect on DMG's operations and profitability. In addition, if DMG's claims processing system is unable to process claims accurately, the data DMG uses for its incurred but not reported estimates could be incomplete and DMG's ability to accurately estimate claims liabilities and establish adequate reserves could be adversely affected. Finally, if DMG's management information systems are unable to function in compliance with applicable state or federal rules and regulations, including medical information confidentiality laws such as HIPAA, possible penalties and fines due to this lack of compliance could have a material adverse effect on DMG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

DMG may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.

Due to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. The ACA has increased the participation of individuals in the Medicaid program in states that elected to participate in the expanded Medicaid coverage. A shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors as well as an increase in the number of uninsured patients may result in a reduction in the rates of reimbursement to DMG or an increase in uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in net revenue. Changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs such as the Medicaid program under the ACA and state decisions on whether to participate in the expansion of such programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of uninsured patients. Even for those patients who remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible receivables. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on DMG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or DMG in particular could adversely affect DMG's results of operations or business.

Negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally, the Medicare Advantage program or DMG in particular, may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase DMG's costs of doing business and adversely affect DMG's results of operations or business by:

•requiring DMG to change its products and services;

•increasing the regulatory, including compliance, burdens under which DMG operates, which, in turn, may negatively impact the manner in which DMG provides services and increase DMG's costs of providing services;

•adversely affecting DMG's ability to market its products or services through the imposition of further regulatory restrictions regarding the manner in which plans and providers market to Medicare Advantage enrollees; or

•adversely affecting DMG's ability to attract and retain members.

Risk factors related to ownership of our common stock:

Provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and Delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.

Our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. These include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent; requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our Board of Directors (or 120 days for nominations made using proxy access); and granting our Board of Directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval.

Most of our outstanding employee stock-based compensation awards include a provision accelerating the vesting of the awards in the event of a change of control. We also maintain a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which has been in place since 2001, and which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. Based on the market price of our common stock and shares outstanding on December 31, 2018, these cash bonuses under the program would total approximately$337 millionif a change of control










transaction occurred at that price and our Board of Directors did not modify this program. These and any other change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for our Company.

We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.

These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
