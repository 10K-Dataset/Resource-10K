ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.

Consumers, public health officials and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with
obesity, particularly among young people. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners. Increasing public concern about these issues; possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning
the marketing, labeling or availability of our beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the
marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for our beverages, which could affect our profitability.

Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system's production costs and capacity.

Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. It is also a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented
challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution, poor management and climate change. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of
available water deteriorates, our system may incur increasing production costs or face capacity constraints which could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.

Changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment could impact our financial results.

The nonalcoholic beverages business environment is rapidly evolving as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, including
changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In
addition, our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the retail channel, particularly in Europe and the United States. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly
changing environment, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.

If we fail to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of CCE's North American business, the value of your investment in our Company may
be adversely affected.

On October 2, 2010, we acquired CCE's North American bottling and distribution operations. We believe that the acquisition will enable us to
evolve our entire business in North America, including the acquired operations, to more profitably deliver our valuable brands in the largest nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverage market in the world. When we










We may incur higher than expected costs in connection with the integration of the acquired CCE North American business, which could hurt our financial performance in future
periods.

We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs and expenses in connection with the integration of the North American businesses
we owned prior to the CCE transaction with the acquired CCE North American business. While we believe that our estimates of integration costs and expenses are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our
actual costs and expenses will not be significantly higher than our current estimates or that we will not incur significant unanticipated integration costs and expenses in the future. If we
underestimated or incur significant unanticipated integration costs and expenses, our future financial results could suffer.

Our indebtedness following completion of the acquisition of CCE's North American business is substantially greater than our historical level of indebtedness, which will
increase our borrowing costs and interest expense in future periods and, therefore, may adversely affect our financial performance.

As a result of the CCE transaction, we assumed approximately $7.9 billion of debt from CCE. As a result of the substantial increase in our
indebtedness, our borrowing costs and interest expense in future periods will be higher than in the past. The increased indebtedness and higher borrowing costs and interest expense may reduce amounts
available for dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and may cause rating agencies to downgrade our debt, all of which could have adverse effects on our future financial
performance.

Our pension expense has substantially increased as a result of the acquisition of CCE's North American business and we may incur multi-employer plan withdrawal liabilities
in the future, which could negatively impact our financial performance.

Our total pension expense for 2010 was $176 million. In 2011, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $240 million,
with most of the expected increase due to the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American business. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of CCE's North American business, the Company
currently participates in various multi-employer pension plans in the United States. Our pension expense for
U.S. multi-employer plans totaled $9 million in 2010. The plans we participate in have contractual arrangements that extend into 2015. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from these plans,
we will likely need to record withdrawal liabilities, some of which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods.

Continuing uncertainty in the credit and equity market conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.

The global credit markets experienced unprecedented disruptions during late 2008 and early 2009. While credit market conditions have improved
somewhat since the crisis, the improvements have not been uniform. The cost and availability of credit vary by market and are subject to changes in the global or regional economic environment. If the
current uncertain conditions in the credit markets continue or worsen, our ability to access credit markets on favorable terms










may
be negatively affected, which could increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, the current uncertain credit market conditions may make it more difficult for our bottling partners to access
financing on terms comparable to those available prior to the global credit crisis, which would affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability as well as our share of the income of bottling
partners in which we have equity method investments. The current uncertain global credit market conditions and their actual or perceived effects on our and our major bottling partners' results of
operations and financial condition, along with the current unfavorable economic environment in the United States and much of the world, may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit
agencies will downgrade our credit ratings, which could have a negative effect on our borrowing costs.

The
significant decline in the equity markets and in the valuation of other assets precipitated by the global credit crisis and related financial system instability affected the value of our pension
plan assets. In spite of improving asset values in late 2009 and 2010, the fair value of our plan assets remains lower than pre-crisis levels, and this could lead to higher pension expense
in the future.

In
addition, some of the major financial institutions remain fragile, and the counterparty risk associated with our existing derivative financial instruments remains higher than pre-crisis
levels. Therefore, we may be unable to secure creditworthy counterparties for derivative transactions in the future or may incur higher than anticipated costs in our hedging activities. The decrease
in availability of consumer credit resulting from the financial crisis, as well as general unfavorable economic conditions, may also cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which would
reduce the demand for our beverages and negatively affect our net revenues and the Coca-Cola system's profitability.

Increased competition could hurt our business.

The nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry is highly competitive. We compete with major international beverage companies
that, like our Company, operate in multiple geographic areas, as well as numerous companies that are primarily local in operation. In many countries in which we do business, including the United
States, PepsiCo, Inc., is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl√©, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Groupe Danone,
Kraft Foods Inc. and Unilever. In certain markets, our competition includes major beer companies. Our beverage products also compete against local or regional brands as well as against store or
private label brands developed by retailers, some of which are Coca-Cola system customers. Our ability to gain or maintain share of sales or gross margins in the global market or in
various local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors.

If we are unable to expand our operations in developing and emerging markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.

Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, which in turn depends on economic and political
conditions in those markets and on our ability to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local bottlers and to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities,
distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Moreover, the supply of our products in developing and emerging markets must match consumers' demand for those products. Due to product price,
limited purchasing power and cultural differences, there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular developing or emerging market.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the
Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. In 2010, we used 74 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived approximately $24.5 billion of net operating revenues
from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and
liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major
currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic devaluations of
currencies in developing or emerging markets, such as the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, could negatively affect the value of our earnings from, and of the assets located in, those markets.
Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We also use derivative financial










instruments
to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, would not materially affect our financial results.

If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.

We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could
suffer.

We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent
companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, many of our bottling
partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottling
partners through a combination of pricing and marketing and advertising support, they may take actions that, while maximizing their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our
Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their energy and resources to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long run, have an adverse
effect on our profitability.

If our bottling partners' financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.








Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

We are subject to income tax in the United States and in numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate net operating revenues. Increases in
income tax rates could reduce our after-tax income from affected jurisdictions. In addition, there have been proposals to reform U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S.
multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will
pass, several of the proposals being considered, if enacted into law, could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.

Increased or new indirect taxes in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect our business.

Our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as "indirect taxes," including
import duties, excise taxes, sales or value-added taxes, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including indirect taxes imposed by state and local
governments. In addition, in early 2009, as part of the proposed health care reform legislation, the United States Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar,
HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners to offset part of the cost of implementing the proposed legislation. The proposed federal excise tax would have applied to our sparkling, juice and juice drink and
sports beverages. While this proposal was not included in the health care legislation signed into law in March 2010, there is no assurance that similar proposals will not be reintroduced in the
future. In addition, as federal, state and local governments experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have proposed singling out beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items.
Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less
affordable.

If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our
business could suffer.

Many of our associates at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. With the acquisition
of CCE's North American business on October 2, 2010, the number of our associates in North America represented by labor unions has substantially increased to approximately 18,600 as of
December 31, 2010. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which would affect our profit margins. In addition, many of
our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our or our major bottlers'
plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which would reduce our revenues and could
expose us to customer claims.

Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of energy could affect our profitability.

CCR, our North America bottling and customer service organization, and our Company-owned or controlled bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and
other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to customers. In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our concentrate
plants and the bottling plants and distribution facilities operated by CCR and our Company-owned or controlled bottlers. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other
energy sources in North America, in other countries in which we have concentrate plants or in any of the major markets in which our Company-owned or controlled bottlers operate that may be caused by
increasing demand or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or the like would increase our operating costs and negatively impact our profitability.

Our
bottling partners also operate large fleets of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to their own customers and use a significant amount of electricity,
natural gas and other energy sources to operate their own bottling plants and distribution facilities. Increases in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in any
of the major markets in which our bottling partners operate would increase the affected bottling partners' operating costs and could indirectly negatively impact our results of operations.










Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients or packaging materials could harm our business.

Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.

We and our bottlers currently offer nonrefillable, recyclable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal
requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain
nonrefillable beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United
States and overseas, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers'
increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. If these
types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale in any of the major markets in which we operate, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which
could reduce our net operating revenues or profitability.

Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.










and
to potential legal challenge. If we were required to add warning labels under Proposition 65 on one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer
reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.

Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States or in other major markets could negatively impact our financial performance.

Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets,
could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, some of our beverages. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing
purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private label brands. Softer consumer demand for our beverages in the
United States or in other major markets could reduce the Coca-Cola system's profitability and could negatively affect our financial performance.

Unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets could hurt our business.

We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of our products in international markets. In 2010, our operations outside
the United States accounted for approximately $24.5 billion of our net operating revenues. Unfavorable economic and political conditions in certain of our international markets,
including civil unrest and governmental changes, could undermine consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, product boycotts
resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products, while restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders which may be imposed or expanded as a result of
political and economic instability could impact our profitability. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentences, the unfavorable business environment in Venezuela, the current unstable
economic and political conditions and civil unrest and political activism in the Middle East, India, Pakistan or the Philippines, the civil unrest and potential instability in Egypt and other
countries in North Africa; the unstable situation in Iraq or the continuation or escalation of terrorist activities could adversely impact our international business.

Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.

Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.

The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather
during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.

If we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand
extensions. We cannot assure you, however, that additional expenditures and our continuing commitment to advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products' brand image and on










consumer
preferences. Product quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause
consumers to choose other products. Allegations of product contamination, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a beverage or other product from all of the markets in which the
affected production was distributed. Product recalls could negatively affect our profitability and brand image. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or "spurious" products,
which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. Also, adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our
products, water usage, labor relations and the like, and campaigns by activists attempting to connect our system to environmental issues, water shortages or workplace or human rights violations in
certain countries in which we operate, could negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and our products' acceptance by consumers.

Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating
revenues.

Changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results.

New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to our Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing
standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods.

If we are not able to achieve our overall long-term goals, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.

We have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives were based on our evaluation of our
growth prospects, which are generally based on volume and sales potential of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and product
mix. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the required volume or revenue growth or the mix of products necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.

If we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our
operations could be disrupted.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage
or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution and invoicing and collection of payments for concentrate or finished
products. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with
regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax










requirements.
In addition, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between
Company personnel and our bottlers and other customers and suppliers. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or
shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers,
telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our information technology
systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our
inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrate or finished products, and could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, if we are
unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our bottling partners, customers
or suppliers.

We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges which could materially affect our financial results.

If we do not successfully integrate and manage our Company-owned or controlled bottling operations, our results could suffer.

From time to time we acquire or take control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and
expertise to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring, taking control of or managing bottling operations and may encounter unexpected
difficulties and costs in restructuring and integrating them into our Company's operating and internal control structures. We may also experience delays in extending our Company's internal control
over financial reporting to newly acquired or controlled bottling operations, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in such operations' financial records and in our
consolidated financial statements. In 2010, net operating revenues generated by our Bottling Investments group (which includes Company-owned or controlled bottling operations other than those managed
by CCR) represented approximately 23 percent of our Company's consolidated net operating revenues. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the
performance of Company-owned or controlled bottling operations. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations. If
we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.

Climate change may negatively affect our business.

There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural
productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, beets, citrus, coffee and
tea, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our










supply
chain or impact demand for our products. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water
availability for our system's bottling operations. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and financial results.

Because of our global presence and worldwide operations, our business can be affected by large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed
against the United States or other major industrialized countries; the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; major natural disasters; or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H1N1
influenza, avian influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (generally known as SARS). Such events could impair our ability to manage our business around the world, could disrupt our supply of raw
materials, and could impact production, transportation and delivery of concentrates, syrups and finished products. In addition, such events could cause disruption of regional or global economic
activity, which can affect consumers' purchasing power in the affected areas and, therefore, reduce demand for our products.
