ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS

The nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to the Company's business activities. Other risks are described in "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations," "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." These risks are not the only risks facing the Company. The Company's business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial. If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations and impair the Company's ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of the Company's common stock could decline.

The prices of oil, NGL and gas are highly volatile. A sustained decline in these commodity prices could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Company's revenues, profitability, cash flow and future rate of growth are highly dependent on commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, NGL and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the Company's control, such as:

•domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, NGL and gas;

•inventory levels at Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark for WTI oil prices;

•oil, NGL and gas inventory levels in the United States;

•the capacity of U.S. refiners to absorb increasing domestic supplies of oil and condensate;

•weather conditions;

•overall domestic and global political and economic conditions, including laws, regulations and administrative policies that restrict the export of the Company's products;

•actions of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;

•the effect of liquefied natural gas deliveries to and exports from the United States;

•technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;

•domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



•the effect of energy conservation efforts;

•the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities; and

•the price and availability of alternative fuels.

In the past, commodity prices have been extremely volatile, and the Company expects this volatility to continue. For example, during2013, oil prices fluctuated from a low of $86.68 per BBL in April to a high of $110.53 per BBL in September, while gas prices fluctuated from a low of $3.11 per MCF in January to a high of $4.46 per MCF in December. During2012, oil prices fluctuated from a high of $109.77 per BBL in February to a low of $77.69 per BBL in June, while gas prices fluctuated from a low of $1.91 per MCF in April to a high of $3.90 per MCF in November. The Company makes price assumptions that are used for planning purposes, and a significant portion of the Company's cash outlays, including rent, salaries and noncancelable capital commitments, are largely fixed in nature. Accordingly, if commodity prices are below the expectations on which these commitments were based, the Company's financial results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected because these cash outlays are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to unanticipated decreases in commodity prices.

Significant or extended price declines could also adversely affect the amount of oil, NGL and gas that the Company can produce economically. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require the Company to reduce capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively affect the Company's ability to replace its production and its future rate of growth.

The Company could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce the Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.

Historically, the Company's capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, NGL and gas prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond the Company's control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that the Company and its vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Increased levels of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry in recent periods have led to increased costs of some drilling equipment, materials and supplies. Such costs may rise faster than increases in the Company's revenue, thereby negatively impacting the Company's profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget. This impact may be magnified to the extent that the Company's ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by its derivative risk management activities.

The Company's derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses.

To mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities, support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects, the Company's strategy is to enter into derivative arrangements covering a portion of its oil, NGL and gas production. These derivative arrangements are subject to MTM accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company's statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant noncash gains or losses. These derivative contracts may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:

•production is less than the contracted derivative volumes;

•the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations; or

•the derivative contracts limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.

On the other hand, failure to protect against declines in commodity prices exposes the Company to reduced liquidity when prices decline.

The failure by counterparties to the Company's derivative risk management activities to perform their obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

The use of derivative risk management transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. If any of these counterparties were to default on its obligations under the Company's derivative arrangements, such a default could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, and could result in a larger percentage of the Company's future production being subject to commodity price changes.

Exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.

Drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, or become costlier, as a result of a variety of factors, including:

•unexpected drilling conditions;






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



•unexpected pressure or irregularities in formations;

•equipment failures or accidents;

•fracture stimulation accidents or failures;

•adverse weather conditions;

•restricted access to land for drilling or laying pipelines; and

•access to, and the cost and availability of, the equipment, services, resources and personnel required to complete the Company's drilling, completion and operating activities.

The Company's future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure could have an adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental, extension or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory and extension drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The Company expects that it will continue to experience exploration and abandonment expense in2014.

Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.

Declines in commodity prices may result in the Company having to make substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if the Company's estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require the Company to impair, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties. The Company is required to perform impairment tests on proved oil and gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved properties may not be recoverable. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of the Company's oil and gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment charge would be required to reduce the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value. For example, during 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized impairment charges of $1.5 billion, $532.6 million and $354.4 million, respectively, due to the impairment of the Company's Raton field, Barnett Shale field, and Edwards and Austin Chalk gas fields in South Texas, respectively, due to declines in long-term gas prices and downward adjustments to the economically recoverable resource potential. The Company may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations in the period incurred.

The Company periodically evaluates its unproved oil and gas properties and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.

AtDecember 31, 2013, the Company carried unproved oil and gas property costs of$123.4 million. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis. These evaluations are affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, and contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.

The Company periodically evaluates its goodwill for impairment and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.

AtDecember 31, 2013, the Company carried goodwill of$274.3 million. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually during the third quarter and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may be impaired, which may require an estimate of the fair values of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities. Those assessments may be affected by (a) additional reserve adjustments both positive and negative, (b) results of drilling activities, (c) management's outlook for commodity prices and costs and expenses, (d) changes in the Company's market capitalization, (e) changes in the Company's weighted average cost of capital and (f) changes in income taxes. If the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets is not sufficient to fully support the goodwill balance in the future, the Company will reduce the carrying value of goodwill for the impaired value, with a corresponding noncash charge to earnings in the period in which goodwill is determined to be impaired.

The Company may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, and any acquisition it completes is subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect its business.

Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have from time to time contributed to the Company's growth. The Company's growth following the full development of its existing property base could be impeded if it is unable to acquire additional oil and gas reserves on a profitable basis. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas industry are very competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause the Company to refrain from, completing acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors and involves potential risks, including among other things:






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



•the inability to estimate accurately the costs to develop the reserves, the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net cash flows attainable from the reserves;

•the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which the Company is not indemnified or for which the indemnity the Company receives is inadequate;

•the validity of assumptions about costs, including synergies;

•the effect on the Company's liquidity or financial leverage of using available cash or debt to finance acquisitions;

•the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and

•an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the Company's growing business and assets.

All of these factors affect whether an acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable return on investment. Even though the Company performs a review of the properties it seeks to acquire that it believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are often limited in scope. As a result, among other risks, the Company's initial estimates of reserves may be subject to revision following an acquisition, which may materially and adversely affect the desired benefits of the acquisition.

The Company's ability to complete dispositions of assets, or interests in assets, may be subject to factors beyond its control, and in certain cases the Company may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.

From time to time, the Company sells an interest in a strategic asset for the purpose of assisting or accelerating the asset's development. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its property base for the purpose of identifying nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. Various factors could materially affect the ability of the Company to dispose of such interests or nonstrategic assets or complete announced dispositions, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the nonstrategic assets on terms and at prices acceptable to the Company.

Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release the Company from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, the Company may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.

The Company's gas processing operations are subject to operational risks, which could result in significant damages and the loss of revenue.

As ofDecember 31, 2013, the Company owned interests insixgas processing plants andninetreating facilities. The Company is the operator oftwoof the gas processing plants and allnineof the treating facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of gas processing plants. Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include carcinogens. Damage to or improper operation of a gas processing plant or facility could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which could result in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue source.

The Company's operations involve many operational risks, some of which could result in unforeseen interruptions to the Company's operations and substantial losses to the Company for which the Company may not be adequately insured.

The Company's operations, including well stimulation and completion activities, such as hydraulic fracturing, are subject to all the risks normally incident to the oil and gas development and production business, including:

•blowouts, cratering, explosions and fires;

•adverse weather effects;

•environmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, encountering NORM, and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;

•high costs, shortages or delivery delays of equipment, labor or other services or water for hydraulic fracturing;

•facility or equipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;

•title problems;

•pipe or cement failures or casing collapses;

•compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;

•lost or damaged oilfield workover and service tools;

•unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure or irregularities in formations; and

•natural disasters.






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



The Company's overall exposure to operational risks may increase as its drilling activity expands and as it seeks to directly provide drilling, fracture stimulation and other services internally. Any of these risks could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations.

The Company is not fully insured against certain of the risks described above, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining such insurance. Additionally, the Company relies to a large extent on facilities owned and operated by third-parties, and damage to or destruction of those third-party facilities could affect the ability of the Company to produce, transport and sell its hydrocarbons.

Part of the Company's strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.

The Company's operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by it and its service providers. Risks that the Company faces while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:

•landing the wellbore in the desired drilling zone;

•staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;

•running casing the entire length of the wellbore; and

•being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.

Risks that the Company faces while completing wells include, but are not limited to, the following:

•the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;

•the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and

•the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.

The results of drilling in emerging areas are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. New discoveries and emerging formations have limited or no production history and, consequently, the Company is more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If the Company's drilling results are worse than anticipated, the return on investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as anticipated and the Company may recognize noncash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of its unproved properties.

The Company's expectations for future drilling activities will be realized over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of such activities.

The Company has identified drilling locations and prospects for future drilling opportunities, including development, exploratory and infill drilling activities. These drilling locations and prospects represent a significant part of the Company's future drilling plans. For example, the Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2013 include proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed reserves that are behind pipe of

102.5

MMBBLs of oil,

41.9

MMBBLs of NGLs and

328.9

BCF of gas. The Company's ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, negotiation of agreements with third parties, commodity prices, costs, access to and availability of equipment, services, resources and personnel and drilling results.  Changes in the laws or regulations on which the Company relies in planning and executing its drilling programs could adversely impact the Company's ability to successfully complete those programs.  For example, under current Texas laws and regulations the Company may receive permits to drill, and may drill and complete, certain horizontal wells that traverse one or more units and/or leases; a change in those laws or regulations could adversely impact the Company's ability to drill those wells. Because of these uncertainties, the Company cannot give any assurance as to the timing of these activities or that they will ultimately result in the realization of proved reserves or meet the Company's expectations for success. As such, the Company's actual drilling activities may materially differ from the Company's current expectations, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's proved reserves, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing, fractionation and refining facilities to market its oil, NGL and gas production; the Company relies on a limited number of purchasers for a majority of its products.

The marketing of oil, NGL and gas production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing, fractionation and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. If there were insufficient capacity available on these systems, if these systems were unavailable to the Company, or if access to these systems were to become commercially unreasonable, the price offered for the Company's production could be significantly depressed, or the Company could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while it constructs its own facility or awaits the availability of third party facilities. The Company also relies (and expects to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transport, fractionate and sell its oil, NGL and gas production. The Company's plans to develop and sell its oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient transportation, storage or processing and fractionation facilities to the Company, especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities do not currently exist.

For example, following Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, certain Permian Basin gas processors were forced to shut down their plants due to the shutdown of the Texas Gulf Coast NGL fractionators. The Company was able to produce its oil wells and vent or flare the associated gas; however, there is no certainty the Company will be able to vent or flare gas in the future due to potential changes in regulations.The amount of oil and gas that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities, or lack of capacity on such facilities. The Company has periodically experienced high line pressure at its tank batteries, which has occasionally led to the flaring of gas due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas to support the increased gas production. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, the Company may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.

To the extent that the Company enters into transportation contracts with gas pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, the Company is subject to FERC requirements related to use of such capacity.  Any failure on the Company's part to comply with FERC's regulations and policies or with an interstate pipeline's tariff could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties.

A limited number of companies purchase a majority of the Company's oil, NGLs and gas. The loss of a significant purchaser could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell its production.

The Company is growing production in areas of high industry activity, which may affect its ability to obtain the personnel, equipment, services, resources and facilities access needed to complete its development activities as planned or result in increased costs.

The Company's operations and drilling activity are concentrated in areas in which industry activity has increased rapidly, particularly in the Spraberry field in West Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas. As a result, demand for personnel, equipment, power, services and resources, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, has increased, as have the costs for those items. In addition, hydraulic fracturing and other operations require significant quantities of water, which supply may be affected by drought conditions. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources and facilities access necessary for the Company to complete its planned development activities, including the result of any changes in laws or regulations applicable to the Company's operations relating to water usage, could result in oil and gas production volumes being below the Company's forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flow and profitability.

The refining industry may be unable to absorb rising U.S. oil and condensate production; in such a case, the resulting surplus could depress prices and restrict the availability of markets.

Under U.S. law and regulations, the export of oil and certain condensates is restricted.  Absent a change in this law or an expansion of U.S. refining capacity, rising U.S. production of oil and condensate could result in a surplus of these products, which would likely cause prices for these commodities to fall and markets to constrict. In such circumstances, the returns on the Company’s capital projects would decline, possibly to levels that would make execution of the Company’s drilling plans uneconomical, and a lack of market for the Company's products could require that the Company shut in some portion of its production.  If this were to occur, the Company’s production and cash flow could decrease, or could increase less than forecasted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's cash flow and profitability.

The nature of the Company's assets and production operations exposes it to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and occupational health and safety matters.

The oil and gas business involves the production, handling, sale and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials and is subject to environmental hazards, such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks, pipeline and vessel ruptures and unauthorized discharges of substances or gases, that could expose the Company to substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. Pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductible associated with obtaining such insurance. A variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of the oil and gas business. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject the Company to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial cleanups, and natural resource damages or other liabilities, and compliance with these laws and regulations may increase the cost of the Company's operations. Such laws and






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



regulations may also affect the costs of acquisitions. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations — Environmental and occupational health and safety matters" above for additional discussion related to environmental risks.

Environmental laws and regulations are subject to amendment or replacement by more stringent laws and regulations and no assurance can be given that continued compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not result in a curtailment of production or processing activities, result in a material increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or processing operations or adversely affect the Company's future operations and financial condition.

The Company could incur significant costs and liabilities in responding to contamination that occurs at its properties or as a result of its operations.

There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in operations upon the Company's properties due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and water discharges related to its operations, and as a result of historical operations and waste disposal practices by prior owners and operators.  The Company currently owns, leases or operates properties that for many years have been used for oil and gas exploration and production activities, and petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes have been released on or under such properties and could be released during future operations.  Joint and several strict liabilities may be incurred in connection with such releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on, under or from the Company's properties.  Private parties, including lessors of properties on which the Company operates and the owners or operators of properties adjacent to the Company's operations and facilities where the Company's petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage.  The Company may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or other sources of contractual indemnity.

The Company's credit facility and debt instruments have substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict its business and financing activities.

The Company is a borrower under fixed rate senior notes and a credit facility. The terms of the Company's borrowings specify scheduled debt repayments and require the Company to comply with certain associated covenants and restrictions. The Company's ability to comply with the debt repayment terms, associated covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among other things, factors outside the Company's direct control, such as commodity prices and interest rates. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Company's outstanding debt as ofDecember 31, 2013and the terms associated therewith.

The Company's ability to obtain additional financing is also affected by the Company's debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing.

The Company faces significant competition, and some of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources.

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a large number of companies, producers and operators in a number of areas such as:

•seeking to acquire oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration;

•marketing oil, NGL and gas production; and

•seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise, including trained personnel, necessary to evaluate, operate and develop properties.

Some of the Company's competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" for additional discussion regarding competition.

The Company is subject to regulations that may cause it to incur substantial costs.

The Company's business is regulated by a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. For instance, in connection with the Company's CBM operations in the Raton Basin in Colorado, the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed a state water court holding that water produced in connection with CBM operations should be subject to state water-use regulations, including regulations requiring permits for diversion and use of surface and subsurface water, an evaluation of potential competing permits, possible uses of the water and a possible requirement to provide augmentation water supplies for water rights owners with more senior rights. As another example, the underground injection well program under the SDWA requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for the Company's disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected. In some areas of Texas, there has been concern that certain formations into which disposal wells are injecting produced waters could become over-pressured after many years of injection, and the governing Texas regulatory agency is reviewing the data to determine whether any action is necessary to address this issue. If the Texas state






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



agency were to decline to issue permits for new injection wells into the formations currently utilized by the Company, the Company may be required to seek alternative methods of disposing of produced waters, including injecting into deeper formations, which could increase its costs.  There can be no assurance that present or future regulations will not adversely affect the Company's business and operations, including that the Company may be required to suspend drilling operations or shut in production pending compliance. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" for additional discussion regarding government regulation.

The Company's sales of oil, gas, NGLs or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to such energy commodities, expose the Company to potential regulatory risks.

FERC, the FTC and the CFTC hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to the Company's business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to the Company's physical sales of oil, gas, NGLs or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to these energy commodities, the Company is required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business results of operations and financial condition.

Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities and net cash flows of the Company's proved reserves may prove to be lower than estimated.

Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows set forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.

Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and estimates of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:

•historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;

•the quality and quantity of available data;

•the interpretation of that data;

•the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;

•assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and

•assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance, ad valorem and excise taxes, development costs, transportation costs and workover and remedial costs.

Because all proved reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:

•the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered;

•the production costs incurred to recover the reserves;

•the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and

•future commodity prices.

Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of proved reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The Company's actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to proved reserves will likely be different from estimates, and the differences may be material.

As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on average prices preceding the date of the estimate and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:

•the amount and timing of actual production;

•levels of future capital spending;

•increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil, NGLs and gas; and

•changes in governmental regulations or taxation.

Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In general, it requires the use of commodity prices that are based upon a 12-month unweighted average, as well as operating and development costs being incurred at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or Standardized Measure in this Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.

The Company's actual production could differ materially from its forecasts.

From time to time, the Company provides forecasts of expected quantities of future oil and gas production. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Should these estimates prove inaccurate, actual production could be adversely affected. In addition, the Company's forecasts assume that none of the risks associated with the Company's oil and gas operations summarized in this "Item 1A. Risk Factors" occur, such as facility or equipment malfunctions, adverse weather effects, or downturns in commodity prices or significant increases in costs, which could make certain drilling activities or production uneconomical.

The Company's business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.

A failure by purchasers of the Company's production to perform their obligations to the Company could require the Company to recognize a pre-tax charge in earnings and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation.

The Company relies on a limited number of purchasers to purchase a majority of its products. To the extent that purchasers of the Company's production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time. If for any reason the Company were to determine that it was probable that some or all of the accounts receivable from any one or more of the purchasers of the Company's production were uncollectible, the Company would recognize a pre-tax charge in the earnings of that period for the probable loss.

Declining general economic, business or industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

The worldwide economic outlook has been improving steadily since 2010, but if there are renewed concerns about global economic growth or government debt in Europe or the United States, there could be a significant adverse effect on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad were to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could depress the prices at which the Company could sell its oil, NGLs and gas and ultimately decrease the Company's net revenue and profitability.

Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.

In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas companies. Such tax legislation changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical

expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, NGLs and gas the Company produces.

The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with its business.

alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Company encounters, reduce the Company's ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts, and increase the Company's exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, the Company's results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. The Company's revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and its results of operations.

Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect the Company's production.

In addition, the U.S. Congress, from time to time, has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. Certain states in which the Company operates, including Colorado and Texas have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well-construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations. In addition, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event federal, state or local restrictions are adopted in areas where the Company is currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, the Company may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that the Company is ultimately able to produce from its reserves.

Certain governmental reviews were recently conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and a draft report is expected to be available for public comment and peer review in 2014. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and is expected to propose these standards in 2014. These studies, or future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. See "Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulations - Environmental and occupational health and safety matters" for additional discussion related to environmental risks associated with the Company's hydraulic fracturing activities.

Laws and regulations pertaining to threatened and endangered species could delay or restrict the Company's operations and cause it to incur substantial costs.

Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. These statutes include the ESA, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the CWA and CERCLA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and gas development. If harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA before completion of the agency's 2017 fiscal year.  The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where the Company conducts operations could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on its development and production activities that could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to develop and produce reserves.

Provisions of the Company's charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.

Provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in the Company's board of directors and management. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transaction and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.

The Company's sand mining operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond the Company's control, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.

Ownership of industrial sand mining operations are subject to risks, many of which are beyond the Company's control. These risks include:

•unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;

•cave-ins, pit wall failures or rock falls;

•unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;

•inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;

•environmental hazards, such as unauthorized spills, releases and discharges of wastes, vessel ruptures and emission of unpermitted levels of pollutants;

•changes in laws and regulations;

•inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;

•restrictions on blasting operations;

•inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;

•reduction in the amount of water available for processing;

•technical difficulties or failures;

•labor disputes;

•late delivery of supplies;

•fires, explosions or other accidents; and

•facility interruptions or shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions.

Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company's mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Not all of these risks are insurable, and the Company's insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. The Company's insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet its needs in the event of loss and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company's estimates of sand reserves and resource deposits are imprecise and actual reserves could be less than estimated.

The Company bases its sand reserve and resource estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by engineers and geologists, which are periodically reviewed by outside firms. However, commercial sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of commercial sand reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Estimates of economically recoverable commercial sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



•geological and mining conditions or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;

•assumptions concerning future prices of commercial sand products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and

•assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.

The Company's sand mining operations are subject to extensive environmental and occupational health and safety regulations that impose significant costs and potential liabilities.

Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in connection with its sand mining operations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely affect the Company, including:

•issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;

•denial, modification or revocation of permits or other authorizations;

•imposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on the Company's operations, including interruptions or cessation of operations; and

•requirements to perform site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.

In addition to environmental regulation, the Company's sand mining operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, including such matters as human exposure to crystalline silica dust. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment.

The Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of the Company's sand mining operations.

The Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. The Company's failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations or otherwise impose significant restrictions on the Company's ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.

The Company's sand mining operations are subject to extensive other regulations that impose significant costs and liabilities.

In addition to the environmental and occupational health and safety regulation discussed above, the Company's sand mining operations are also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, and the effects that mining have on groundwater quality and availability. Also, the Company's sand mining operations require numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each sand mining facility.

In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future for its sand mining operations, the Company may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the effect that any such activities may have on the environment.






Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY



Obtaining or renewing required permits may be delayed or prevented due to opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the public or other third parties and other factors beyond the Company's control. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations at the affected facility. Current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations and the Company may not be able to renew or obtain permits in the future.

The Company's sand mining operations entail silica-related health issues and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The inhalation of respirable crystalline silica dust is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders, such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the commercial sand industry. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling sand could materially and adversely affect the Company through the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits and increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities.

Premier Silica is named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of Premier Silica's customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. As of December 31, 2013, Premier Silica was the subject of approximately 2,200 silica exposure claims, the great majority of which have been inactive for many years due to the plaintiffs' failure to meet specific legal requirements to advance their claims. Almost all of the claims pending against Premier Silica arise out of the alleged use of Premier Silica's sand products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Florida and Missouri, although some cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years.

It is possible that Premier Silica will continue to have silica-related products liability claims filed against it, including claims that allege silica exposure for periods for which there is not insurance coverage. Any pending or future claims or inadequacies of insurance coverage or indemnification from the seller could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.
