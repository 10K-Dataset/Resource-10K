ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor or potential investor in our securities should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.

A substantial or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a material adverse effect on Newmont.

Our business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:

●

Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;

●

Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold or copper;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

●

The relative strength of the U.S. dollar;

●

The monetary policies employed by the world’s major Central Banks;

●

The fiscal policies employed by the world’s major industrialized economies;

●

Expectations of the future rate of inflation;

●

Interest rates;

●

Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;

●

Decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

●

Increased import and export taxes;

●

Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

●

Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; and

●

Availability of cheaper substitute materials.

Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold or copper sales. We have recorded asset write-downs in the past and may experience additional write-downs as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the future.

In addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:

●

Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained lower gold or copper prices;

●

Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record as an impairment charge related to the carrying value of its stockpiles;

●

Halt or delay the development of new projects;

●

Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and

●

Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper Price.

We may be unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become depleted.

Gold and copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits, or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.

We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold or copper prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with future acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.

As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.

Estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.

The reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold and copper that we estimated, at December 31, 2014, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold and copper and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.

Additionally, the term “mineralized material” as used in this report does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company’s standards. Estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Despite the Company’s history of converting a substantial portion of mineralized material to reserves through additional drilling and study work, the Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the mineralized material deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.

In addition, if the price of gold or copper declines from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves or mineralized material as currently reported can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our ore reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and mineralized material. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and mineralized material are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.

Increased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.

Costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.

We could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the last several years, as a result of factors beyond our control, including the prices of steel and other commodities and labor, as well as the demand for certain mining and processing equipment. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Estimates relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up.

Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:

●

Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;

●

Changes in input commodity and labor costs;

●

The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;

●

Adverse geotechnical conditions;

●

Availability of adequate and skilled labor force;

●

Availability, supply and cost of water and power;

●

Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;

●

Availability and terms of financing;

●

Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development;

●

Changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;

●

Weather or severe climate impacts, including without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation and/or sub-zero temperatures; and

●

Potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages.

Our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.

The exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:

●

Environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;

●

Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining transportation equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling, processing and transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials;

●

Surface or underground fires or floods;

●

Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);

●

Ground and water conditions;

●

Fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;

●

Failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;

●

Seismic activity; and



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

●

Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.

The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development and production of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.

Shortages of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.

The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules.

Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

As a result of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally and large multinational corporations in natural resources industries, such as Newmont, in particular, face increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, communities surrounding operations and the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have a high impact on their social and physical environment. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increasing social investment obligations and pressure to increase taxes and royalties payable to governments and communities.

In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate in communities around the world will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals may adversely affect our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be varied in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations.

Our exploration, development, mining and processing operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water quality, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous waste management and reclamation. Some of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our closure processes and operations.

Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. For instance, the operation of our mines in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. If such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Over the past several years MSHA has significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations and increased the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is currently seeking to regulate as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) process solution streams derived from core beneficiation operations, such as our roasting operations, in Nevada. Historically, such streams have been considered exempt from RCRA and have been regulated by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. The regulation of these streams as hazardous waste under RCRA could subject us to civil and criminal penalties for past practices.

Increased global attention or regulation on consumption of water by industrial activities, as well as water quality discharge, and on restricting or prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in processing activities could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.

We have implemented a management system designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate, and thus, our results of operations and our financial position, could be adversely affected by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.

Mine closure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.

Natural resource companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. For example, we have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. We are conducting remediation activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive uranium mine and mill site formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont.

Any underestimated or unanticipated rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders in the related period. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position. For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

Regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Energy costs account for approximately twenty percent of our overall operating costs, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal.

A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 18

th

Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in 2012, Parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed to a second commitment period of emissions reductions from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020, which takes the form of an amendment to the Protocol. The 37 countries with binding targets in the second commitment period include Australia, and all members of the European Union. Several Annex I Parties who participated in Kyoto's first-round have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period, including Japan, New Zealand, and Russia. Other Annex I Parties without second-round targets are the United States (which never became a member to the Kyoto Protocol) and Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol effective 2012).

Some of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

current and projected concentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare. Regulations have been adopted and additional laws or regulations may be promulgated in the U.S. to address the concerns raised by such endangerment finding. To date, U.S. regulations do not impose carbon tax on our operations but may in the future. Australia passed the Clean Energy Act in 2011 that sets up a mechanism to mitigate climate change by imposing a “carbon tax” on greenhouse gas emissions and encourage investment in clean energy, which had the potential to impact our Australian operations. However, the Australian Clean Energy Act was subsequently repealed, thereby removing the related “carbon tax”. The current legislation, Direct Action, remains to be defined and it is currently unclear if it will have a cost impact on our business.

Legislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. In June 2014, the EPA proposed new rules for existing power plants under Section 111(d) of the Clean Act that would require, if the proposed rules are enacted as currently drafted, the decommissioning or conversion to natural gas of the TS Power Plant in Nevada by 2020. Final rules are expected in 2015. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future requirements becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to compete.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. Operations that rely on national hydro-electric grid power can be adversely affected by drought resulting in power load-shedding and lost production. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.

Our operations are subject to risks of doing business.

Exploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business, including:

●

Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act;

●

Changes in laws or regulations;

●

Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, New Zealand, Peru, Suriname, the U.S. and the State of Nevada;

●

Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;

●

Delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements;

●

Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals, such as the ratification of the Akyem mining lease.

●

Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;

●

Expropriation or nationalization of property;

●

Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;

●

Foreign exchange controls;

●

Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;

●

Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold and/or copper;

●

Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington and Batu Hijau operations where use of alternative ports is not currently economically feasible or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

●

Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;

●

Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;

●

Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism;

●

Risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues, such as Ebola;

●

Disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues;

●

Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;

●

Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; and

●

Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights.

Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.

Our business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.

We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our Code of Conduct and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. There can be no assurance that Newmont’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.

Our Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia is subject to political and economic risks.

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone periods of financial crises and currency devaluation, outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts of terrorism, changes in national leadership, devolution of authority to regional governments, and the secession of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, regulatory changes that impose greater financial burdens, increased taxation and royalties (at both the national and regional level), denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. In 2014, elections for the president of Indonesia and the national parliament were held and the new administration’s policies pertaining to foreign investment remain under development. In regard to issues of resource nationalism, certain government officials and members of parliament may have a preference for government or domestic company ownership of Indonesia’s mineral assets and mining operations, and the government has advocated policies intended to result in development of additional in-country processing and refining of minerals mined in Indonesia and restrictions on exportation, including the smelting and refining and exportation of copper concentrates.

Most recently, in 2014, the Indonesian government issued new regulations pertaining to the export of copper concentrate that contain potentially restrictive conditions in respect of obtaining an export permit and impose a new export duty. The 2009 mining law preserves the validity of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara’s (“PTNNT,” the entity operating the Batu Hijau mine) Contract of Work (the investment agreement entered into by PTNNT and the Indonesian government in 1986, which includes the right to export copper concentrates and a prohibition against new taxes, duties, and levies), and the Company believes and contended that these 2014 regulations were contrary to the Contract of Work. After PTNNT’s Batu Hijau mine was shut down in June 2014 due to an inability to export copper concentrate and PTNNT and its majority shareholder filed for international arbitration, PTNNT and the government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2014 in which, among other things, PTNNT agreed to pay higher



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

royalties and certain export duties and the government agreed to issue permits to allow PTNNT to export and sell copper concentrates. The government then issued a six month export permit that expires in mid March 2015. PTNNT is working with the government to amend its Contract of Work to resolve ongoing issues pertaining to in-country smelting and refining and export of copper concentrate. However, due to the limited smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia, the 2014 regulations could result in the inability to export copper concentrate or additional financial obligations, which could adversely impact our future operating and financial results.

Violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other countries and U.S. involvement in conflicts in the Middle East, may increase the risk that foreign operations owned by U.S. companies will be the target of violence. If our Batu Hijau operation were so targeted it could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our Batu Hijau operation faced demonstrations by the local community in 2011 relating to a worker recruitment process, including protests and roadblocks. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur and the recurrence of significant opposition from the local community could disrupt mining activities and, thereby, adversely affect Batu Hijau’s assets and operations. Batu Hijau also faced temporary work stoppages in 2011 and 2012, and the operation’s collective bargaining agreement with the workforce expired at the end of 2014 and negotiations for a new agreement are ongoing. Indonesia has seen greater worker and union activism in recent times, and a strike or protracted labor agreement negotiation could adversely affect Batu Hijau’s operations.

We are required to apply for renewals of certain key permits related to Batu Hijau. For example, PTNNT utilizes a submarine tailings placement (“STP”) system. The STP system is operated pursuant to a permit from the government of Indonesia that was renewed in 2011. The inability to renew the STP permit, the export permit or other key permits would be expected to adversely impact Batu Hijau operations and may adversely impact our future operating and financial results.

Our ownership interest in Batu Hijau has been reduced in accordance with the Contract of Work issued by the Indonesian Government and future reductions in our interest in PTNNT may result in our loss of control over the Batu Hijau operations.

We currently have a 31.5% direct ownership interest in PTNNT, held through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which is owned with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan (“Sumitomo”). We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and a Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PTNNT, the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009, Newmont entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated non-controlling shareholder in PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTPI’s 20% shareholding in PTNNT; (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax; (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine; and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, powers of attorney to vote and sell the PTNNT shares (only as further security for the financing arrangement in support of the pledge, and only enforceable in an event of default). On June 25, 2010, PTPI completed the sale of approximately a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), and, to effectuate PTPI’s desire to sell the shares, Newmont entered into a transaction with PTIMI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTIMI’s 2.2% shareholding in PTNNT; (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax; and (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company has no powers of attorney or other right to vote PTIMI’s shares. Based on the above transactions, Newmont recognizes an additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined with Newmont’s 56.25% ownership in NTPBV, Newmont has a 48.5% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the Indonesian government and PTNNT, 51% of PTNNT’s shares were required to be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. As PTPI owned 20% of PTNNT’s shares at relevant times and an additional 24% stake in PTNNT had previously been divested, a final 7% stake was offered to the Indonesian government in March 2010. On May 6, 2011 we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance for the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake. Subsequently, a dispute over the legality of the purchase under relevant laws and regulations arose between certain members of parliament and the Ministry of Finance, and the transaction never closed despite NTPBV and the agency repeatedly agreeing to extend the period for satisfying the closing conditions. Upon divestment of the 7% stake, our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s production, assets and proven and probable reserves would reduce to a 27.5625% direct ownership interest as NTPBV’s ownership interest in PTNNT would reduce to 49%, thus potentially affecting our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau. We will also continue to hold, however, a 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT through the financing arrangements with existing shareholders described above, and we have identified Variable Interest Entities in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to these financing arrangements and shareholder commitments. Therefore, we expect to continue to consolidate PTNNT in our Consolidated Financial



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Statements after the final 7% sale is completed. Loss of effective control over PTNNT operations may result in our deconsolidation of PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, total assets and operating cash flows. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Item 2 - Properties – Indonesia for more information about the PTNNT share divestiture.

As part of the negotiation of the 2009 divestiture share sale agreements with PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), the nominee of the local governments, the parties executed an operating agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), under which each recognizes the rights of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards to the management of PTNNT’s operations, including standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The Operating Agreement became effective in February 2010 and will continue for so long as Newmont and Sumitomo collectively own more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the Operating Agreement terminates, then Newmont may lose control over the applicable operating standards for Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that detracts from value or results in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by Newmont and Sumitomo.

The Contract of Work has been and may continue to be the subject of dispute, legal review, or requests for renegotiation by the Indonesian government, and is subject to termination by the Indonesian government if we do not comply with our obligations, which would result in the loss of all or much of the value of Batu Hijau.

The divestiture provisions of the Contract of Work have been the subject of dispute. In 2008, Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the “MEMR”) alleged that PTNNT breached its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatened to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest shares in accordance with the direction of the MEMR. The matter was resolved by an international arbitration panel in March 2009. The arbitration decision led to NTPBV divesting 24% of PTNNT’s shares to PTMDB, the party nominated by the MEMR.

Although the Indonesian government has not, since the 2008 arbitration, alleged that PTNNT is in breach of the Contract of Work, future disputes may arise under the Contract of Work. From time to time, some Indonesian government officials have advocated for the elimination of Contracts of Work and could instigate future disputes surrounding the Contract of Work, particularly given that Batu Hijau is a large business operated by a non-Indonesian company. Although any dispute under the Contract of Work is subject to international arbitration, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such dispute and any termination of the Contract of Work could result in substantial diminution in the value of our interests in PTNNT. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2 - Properties – Indonesia for more information about the disputes involving the Contract of Work.

In January 2009, the Indonesian Government passed a new mining law. While the law preserves the validity of the Contract of Work, and therefore, PTNNT’s right to operate Batu Hijau pursuant to the Contract of Work, in January 2014 the Indonesian government issued new regulations pertaining to domestic processing and refining and the export of copper concentrate that contained restrictive conditions for export permits and a new export duty, which regulations conflict with the provisions of the Contract of Work. After PTNNT’s Batu Hijau mine was shut down due to an inability to export copper concentrate and PTNNT and its majority shareholder filed for international arbitration, PTNNT and the government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2014 that set out a framework for negotiating an amendment to the Contract of Work and in which, among other things, PTNNT agreed to pay higher royalties and certain export duties and the government agreed to grant recommendations and permits necessary to allow PTNNT to export and sell copper concentrates. The government then issued a six-month export permit that expires in mid March 2015. PTNNT and the Indonesian government have not yet reached agreement on terms for an amendment to the Contract of Work and no assurances can be made in respect of the outcome of such negotiations or future permit renewals. Future disputes relating to the Contract of Work or the failure to obtain export permits could impact operating plans at Batu Hijau and adversely impact our future operating and financial results.

Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks, which have resulted most recently in the rescheduling of construction activities in our Conga project.

During the last several years, Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect Conga’s development and the continued operation of Yanacocha.

Construction activities on our Conga project were suspended on November 30, 2011 at the request of Peru’s central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010, was reviewed by independent experts, in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided some recommendations to improve water management. Yanacocha is currently focusing on the construction of water reservoirs prior to the development of other project facilities. However, development of Conga is contingent upon generating acceptable project returns and getting local community and government support. Should the Company be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, the Company may in the future reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Suriname, which may result in an impairment of the Conga project.

The Central Government of Peru continued to support responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru in 2014. However, we are unable to predict whether the Central government will continue to take similar positions in the future. The regional government of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed the Conga project and continue to reject the viability of its development. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect Yanacocha or Conga. Such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties, as well as future protests, community demands and road blockages. We cannot predict future positions of either the Central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any inability to continue to develop the Conga project or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth if we are not able to replace its expected production.

Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.

Newmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines, including, without limitation, in Indonesia at the Batu Hijau open-pit mine and at our operations in Australia, Nevada, Peru and Waihi.

No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides and pit wall failures, will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.

Geotechnical failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of ore and other impacts, which could cause one or more of our projects to be less profitable than currently anticipated and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Currency fluctuations may affect our costs.

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations. Gold and copper is sold throughout the world based principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States.

The foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every $0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $77 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking into account the impact of currency hedging. During the majority of 2014, the Australian dollar was relatively weaker than the U.S. dollar compared to 2013. The annual average Australian dollar exchange rate depreciated by approximately 7% from 2014 to 2013. We hedge a portion of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures to reduce the variability of our Australian dollar exposure. At December 31, 2014 we have hedged 21%, 12%, 8%, and 4% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Our Australian dollar derivative programs will limit the benefit to Newmont of future decreases, if any, in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rates. For additional information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates,



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

below. For a more detailed description of how currency exchange rates may affect costs, see discussion in Foreign Currency in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk.

Our business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms.

The construction and operation of potential future projects and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and costs of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations, retire or service all of our outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.

Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.

There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. In November 2013, Standard & Poor’s lowered our credit rating from BBB+ to BBB, and, in June 2014, revised its outlook to negative from stable. In January 2014, Moody’s Investors Service issued a notice that Newmont’s debt had been placed on “Review for possible downgrade”. Subsequently in May 2014, Moody’s Investors Service issued a notice that Newmont’s debt has been downgraded to Baa2 with negative outlook. We cannot make assurances regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.

To the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.

From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand our operations and reported reserves and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

●

Identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;

●

Obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially Newmont’s shareholders;

●

Maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;

●

Implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and

●

To the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

Our operations may be adversely affected by energy shortages.

Our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Our principal energy sources are electricity, purchased petroleum products, natural gas and coal. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.

We have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana resulting primarily from drought, insufficient rainfall or other circumstances, increasing demands for electricity and insufficient hydroelectric or other generating capacity which caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo and Akyem operations. Most recently, in late January 2015, in response to power shortages in Ghana resulting from insufficient rainfall, the Government of Ghana notified the mining industry of the need to reduce power usage, which could result in intermittent and frequent shut downs of operations. The Company is in discussions with the government to explore power conservation alternatives that minimize disruptions to operations, employee incomes and government tax revenues. However, no assurances can be made that an alternative solution will be agreed to. Shut downs or load shedding relating to such power shortages may result in the deferral or curtailment of production at our Ahafo and Akyem operations, impact plant maintenance and impact other fuel availability and costs. The need to use alternative sources of power may result in higher than anticipated costs, which will affect operating costs. Continued power shortages or disruptions and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

Continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations.

Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control. For example, the continuation of the drought in southwest Australia could impact our raw water supply at Boddington. While we incorporated systems to address the impact of dry season as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.

We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.

We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.

We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.

The occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.

Our business depends on good relations with our employees.

Production at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2014, various unions represented approximately 44% of our employee work force worldwide. There can be no assurance that any future disputes will be resolved without disruptions to operations.

We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.

A significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:

●

Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;

●

The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;

●

Reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;

●

Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;

●

Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;

●

Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and

●

Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.

In addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.

We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to Newmont, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Title to some of our properties may be defective or challenged.

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not preclude third parties from challenging our title or related property rights. While we believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native title or traditional landowner claims, and our ability to use these properties is dependent on agreements with traditional owners of the properties. A determination of defective title or restrictions in connection with a challenge to title rights could impact our ability to develop and operate at certain properties, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For information regarding native title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Australia/New Zealand section of Item 2, Properties, below.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Competition from other natural resource companies may harm our business.

We compete with other natural resource companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We also compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper and other minerals. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.

Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s current and long-term deferred tax assets were $240 and $1,790, respectively.

Returns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.

We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. During the second half of 2008 and early 2009, market conditions caused the value of the investments in our pension plans to decrease significantly. As a result, we contributed $53 and $54 to the pension plans in 2014 and 2013, respectively. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions. For a more detailed discussion of the funding status and expected benefit payments to plan participants, see the discussion in Employee-Related Benefits, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock and utilized a gold price-linked dividend policy as described under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.
