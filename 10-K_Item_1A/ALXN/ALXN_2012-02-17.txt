Item 1A.Risk Factors.

You should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in Alexion and our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Lead Product Soliris



We depend heavily on the success of our lead product, Soliris. If we are unable to increase sales of Soliris, or obtain approval or commercialize Soliris in new territories for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or for additional indications, or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.

Our ability to generate revenues will continue to depend on commercial success of Soliris in the United States, Europe, Japan and in a number of key markets in the rest of the world and whether physicians, patients and health care payers view Soliris as therapeutically effective and safe relative to cost.  Since we launched Soliris in the United States in April 2007, essentially all of our revenue has been attributed to sales of Soliris, and we expect that Soliris product sales will continue to contribute to a significant percentage or almost all of our total revenue over the next several years.

In September and November 2011 we obtained marketing approval in the United States and the European Union, respectively, for Soliris for the treatment of a second indication, aHUS.

The commercial success of Soliris and our ability to generate and increase revenues will depend on several factors, including the following:

•receipt of marketing approvals for Soliris for the treatment of PNH in new territories and the maintenance of marketing approvals for the treatment of PNH in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories;

•receipt and maintenance of marketing approvals for Soliris for the treatment of aHUS in Japan and other territories and the maintenance of the marketing approval in the United States and the European Union;

•the number of patients with PNH and aHUS, and the number of those patients who are diagnosed with PNH and aHUS and identified to us;

•the number of patients with PNH and aHUS that may be treated with Soliris;

•successful continuation of commercial sales in the United States, Japan and in European countries where we are already selling Soliris for the treatment of PNH, and successful launch in countries where we have not yet obtained, or only recently obtained, marketing approval or commenced sales;

•successfully launching commercial sales of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS in the United States and Europe, and in countries where we have not yet obtained marketing approval;

•ability to obtain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third-party payers and our ability to maintain coverage or reimbursement at anticipated levels;

•acceptance of Soliris in the medical community;








•establishment and maintenance of commercial manufacturing capabilities ourselves or through third-party manufacturers; and

•our ability to develop, register and commercialize Soliris for indications other than PNH, including aHUS.

If we are not successful in increasing sales of Soliris in the United States, Europe and Japan and commercializing in the rest of the world, or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, we may experience surplus inventory, our business may be materially harmed and we may need to significantly curtail operations.



Because the target patient populations of Soliris for the treatment of PNH and aHUS are small and have not been definitively determined, we must be able to successfully identify patients and achieve a significant market share in order to maintain profitability and growth.



PNH and aHUS are each ultra-rare diseases with small patient populations that have not been definitively determined.  There can be no guarantee that any of our programs will be effective at identifying patients and the number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with Soliris, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.





If we are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels, reimbursement for Soliris from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, our pricing may be affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.



We may not be able to sell Soliris on a profitable basis or our profitability may be reduced if we are required to sell our product at lower than anticipated prices or reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount. Soliris is significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments and almost all patients require some form of third party coverage to afford its cost.  Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on governmental, private third-party payers and other third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States or country specific governmental organizations, to defray the cost of Soliris to the patient.  These entities may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to Soliris, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and reimbursement than anticipated, or reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, including in the form of higher mandatory rebates or modified pricing terms.  In any such case, our pricing or reimbursement for Soliris may be affected and our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.

The potential increase in the number of patients receiving Soliris may cause third-party payers to modify or limit coverage or reimbursement for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS, or both indications.

Changes in pricing or the amount of reimbursement in countries where we currently commercialize Soliris may also reduce our profitability and worsen our financial condition.  In the United States, European countries, and elsewhere, there








have been, and we expect there will continue to be, efforts to control and reduce health care costs. Government and other third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for health care products and increasingly limiting and attempting to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs. For example, during 2010 the German government adopted legislation to increase mandatory discounts on pharmaceutical products and impose a temporary freeze on pharmaceutical pricing, including Soliris.  A significant reduction in the amount of reimbursement or pricing for Soliris in one or more countries may have a material adverse effect on our business.  See additional discussion below under the headings “Government initiatives that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products could adversely affect our business” and “The credit and financial market conditions may aggravate certain risks affecting our business.”  In addition, certain countries establish pricing and reimbursement amounts by reference to the price of the same or similar products in other countries.  If coverage or the level of reimbursement is limited in one or more countries, we may be unable to obtain or maintain anticipated pricing or reimbursement in current or new territories.

Many third-party payers cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such payer more expensive for patients, and require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug.  Third-party payers may be especially likely to impose these obstacles to coverage for higher-priced drugs such as Soliris.

Even in countries where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts or annual or lifetime caps on reimbursements may represent a barrier to obtaining or continuing Soliris.  We have financially supported non-profit organizations which assist patients in accessing treatment for PNH, including Soliris.  Such organizations assist patients whose insurance coverage leaves them with prohibitive co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations.  Such organizations' ability to provide assistance to PNH patients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at adequate levels, if at all.  We have also provided Soliris without charge to patients who have no insurance coverage for drugs for related charitable purposes.  We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however, substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future.



We are also focusing development efforts on the use of eculizumab for the treatment of additional diseases.  The success of these programs depends on many factors, including those described under the heading "Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates, including Eculizumab for Indications Other than PNH and aHUS."  If eculizumab is approved by regulatory agencies for indications other than PNH, the potential increase in the number of patients receiving Soliris may cause third-party payers to refuse coverage or reimbursement for Soliris for the treatment of PNH or any other approved indication, or provide a lower level of coverage or reimbursement than anticipated or currently in effect.



We may not be able to gain or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients, which would prevent us from maintaining profitability or growth in the future.





If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with continuing United States and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market Soliris or our manufacturers could lose their approvals to manufacture Soliris, and our business would be seriously harmed.



We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our regulatory approvals for Soliris.  If we do not maintain our regulatory approvals for Soliris, the value of our company and our results of operations will be materially harmed.  We and our current and future partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal and state agencies, and governmental authorities in other territories.  These regulations continue to apply after product approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, finishing, vialing, labeling,








advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, adverse event reporting requirements, and export of biologics.  For example, the risk management program established in 2007 upon the FDA's approval of Soliris for the treatment of PNH was replaced with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program (REMS) program, approved by the FDA in 2010.  The REMS program requires mandatory physician certification in the United States.  Each physician must certify that the physician is aware of the potential risks associated with the administration of Soliris and that the physician will inform each patient of these risks using educational material approved by the FDA.

As a condition of approval for marketing Soliris, governmental authorities may require us to conduct additional studies.  For example, in connection with the approval of Soliris in the United States, European Union and Japan, for the treatment of PNH, we agreed to establish a PNH Registry, monitor immunogenicity, monitor compliance with vaccination requirements, and determine the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal among PNH patients receiving eculizumab, and, specifically in Japan, we agreed to conduct a trial in a limited number of Japanese PNH patients to evaluate the safety of a meningococcal vaccine.  Further, in connection with the approval of Soliris in the United States for the treatment of aHUS, we agreed to establish an aHUS Registry and complete additional human clinical studies in adult and pediatric patients.  In the United States, for example, the FDA can propose to withdraw approval for a product if it determines that such additional studies are inadequate or if new clinical data or information shows that a product is not safe for use in an approved indication.  We are required to report any serious and unexpected adverse experiences and certain quality problems with Soliris to the FDA, the EMA, MHLW, and certain other health agencies.  We, the FDA, the EMA, the MHLW or another health agency may have to notify health care providers of any such developments.

The discovery of any previously unknown problems with Soliris, a manufacturer or a facility may result in restrictions on Soliris, a manufacturer or a facility, including withdrawal of Soliris from the market, batch failures, or interruption of production.  Certain changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often require prior regulatory approval before the product as modified may be marketed.  Our manufacturing and other facilities and those of any third parties manufacturing Soliris will be subject to inspection prior to grant of marketing approval by each regulatory authority where we seek marketing approval and subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities.  We and any third party we would use to manufacture Soliris for sale, including Lonza, must also be licensed by applicable regulatory authorities.

Failure to comply with the laws and requirements, including statutes and regulations, administered by the FDA, the EMA, the MHLW or other agencies, could result in:



•administrative and judicial sanctions, including, warning letters;

•fines and other civil penalties;

•withdrawal of a previously granted approval for Soliris;

•interruption of production;

•operating restrictions;

•delays in approving or refusal to approve Soliris or a facility that manufactures Soliris;

•product recall or seizure;

•injunctions; and

•criminal prosecution.



If the use of Soliris harms people, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to Soliris, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.



The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of drugs for use in humans exposes us to product liability risks.  Side effects and other problems from using Soliris could (1) lessen the frequency with which physicians decide to prescribe Soliris, (2) encourage physicians to stop prescribing Soliris to their patients who previously had been prescribed Soliris, (3) cause serious adverse events and give rise to product liability claims against us, and (4) result in our need to withdraw or recall Soliris from the marketplace.  Some of these risks are unknown at this time.

We tested Soliris in only a small number of patients.  The FDA marketing approval for the treatment of patients with aHUS was based on two prospective studies in a total of 37 adult and adolescent patients, together with a retrospective study that included 19 pediatric patients.  PNH and aHUS are ultra-rare diseases.  As more patients use Soliris, including more children and adolescents, new risks and side effects may be discovered, the rate of known risks or side effects may increase, and risks previously viewed as less significant could be determined to be significant.  Previously unknown risks and adverse








We may be sued by people who use Soliris, whether as a prescribed therapy, during a clinical trial, during an investigator initiated study, or otherwise.  Many patients who use Soliris are already very ill.  Any informed consents or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our trials or use Soliris may not protect us from liability or litigation.  Our product liability insurance may not cover all potential types of liabilities or may not cover certain liabilities completely.  Moreover, we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.  In addition, negative publicity relating to the use of Soliris or a product candidate, or to a product liability claim, may make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to market and sell Soliris.  As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Patients who use Soliris already often have severe and advanced stages of disease and known as well as unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks, including, for example, bone marrow failure.  During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to Soliris.  Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market Soliris, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts.  Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to Soliris, the investigation into the circumstance may be time consuming or inconclusive.  These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals Soliris receives or maintains.

We are also aware of a potential risk for PNH patients who delay a dose of Soliris or discontinue their treatment of Soliris. Treatment with Soliris blocks complement and allows complement-sensitive PNH red blood cells to increase in number. If treatment with Soliris is thereafter delayed or discontinued, a greater number of red blood cells therefore would become susceptible to destruction when the patient's complement system is no longer blocked. The rapid destruction of a larger number of a patient's red blood cells may lead to numerous complications, including death. Several PNH patients in our studies of Soliris have received delayed doses or discontinued their treatment. In none of those circumstances were significant complications shown to be due to rapid destruction of a larger number of PNH red blood cells; however, we have not studied the delay or termination of treatment in enough patients to determine that such complications in the future are unlikely to occur. Additionally, such delays or discontinuations may be associated with significant complications without evidence of such rapid cell destruction.

We are aware of a risk for aHUS patients who delay or miss a dose of Soliris or discontinue their treatment of Soliris.  Treatment with Soliris blocks complement and inhibits complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).  After missing a dose or discontinuing Soliris, blood clots may form in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction








in platelet count.  The reduction in platelet count may lead to numerous complications, including changes in mental status, seizures, angina, thrombosis, renal failure or even death.  In our aHUS clinical studies, such TMA complications were observed in some patients who missed a dose.

Clinical evaluations of outcomes in the post-marketing setting are required to be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations.  Determination of significant complications associated with the delay or discontinuation of Soliris could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell Soliris.

Although we obtained regulatory approval to market and sell Soliris for PNH and aHUS in the United States and European Union, and Soliris for PNH in Japan and other territories, we cannot guarantee that we will obtain the regulatory approval or reimbursement approval for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or other diseases in each territory where we seek approvals.



Governments in countries where we seek to commercialize Soliris regulate the distribution of drugs and the facilities where such drugs are manufactured, and obtaining their approvals can be lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain.  The approval process varies from country to country, and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.  In certain jurisdictions, we are required to finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes prior to marketing our products, even in countries where marketing approval has been obtained.  We received regulatory approval for Soliris for treatment of patients with PNH in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories.  In September and November 2011 we received regulatory approval for Soliris for the treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States and the European Union, respectively.  We may not receive regulatory approval for Soliris for the treatment of PNH, aHUS or any other disease in any other territories on a timely basis, if ever.



Our commercialization of Soliris may be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if we or any other third party provider fails to provide sufficient quantities of Soliris. Commercial quantities of Soliris can only be manufactured at two facilities, including our own facility in Rhode Island, and vial filling can only be performed at one third party facility.  We are currently entirely dependent on a single third party to manufacture commercial quantities of Soliris for sale in Japan.



Commercial quantities of Soliris are manufactured by us at Alexion's Rhode Island Manufacturing Facility (ARIMF) and by Lonza. Manufacturing processes must comply with applicable regulations and manufacturing practices, as well as our own quality standards. In particular, the manufacture of Soliris is heavily regulated by governmental authorities around the world, including the FDA, EMA and MHLW. If we or our third-party providers, including our product vialer, packagers and labelers, fail to comply fully with such regulations then there could be a government-enforced shutdown of production facilities or production lines, which in turn could lead to product shortages.

The manufacture of Soliris is difficult.  Manufacture of a biologic requires a multi-step controlled process and even minor problems or deviations could result in defects or failures.  We cannot be certain that we, Lonza or our other third party providers will be able to perform uninterrupted supply chain services. The failure to manufacture appropriate supplies of Soliris, on a timely basis, or at all, may prevent or interrupt the commercialization of Soliris.  If we, Lonza or our other third party providers were unable to manufacture Soliris for any period, or if we, Lonza or our other third party providers do not obtain approval of the respective facility by the applicable regulatory agencies, we may incur substantial loss of sales.  If we are forced to find an alternative supplier or other third party providers for Soliris, in addition to loss of sales, we may also incur significant costs and experience significant delay in establishing a new arrangement.








The EC and the FDA approved the use of ARIMF for the production of Soliris in December 2009 and August 2010, respectively.  We are authorized to sell product that is manufactured in our facility in the United States, the European Union and certain other territories.  However, we will not be capable of manufacturing Soliris at ARIMF for commercial sale in Japan or other territories until such time as we have received the required regulatory approval for our facility, if ever.  We will continue to depend entirely on one company, Lonza, to manufacture Soliris for commercial sale in Japan and such other territories until that time.

In September and November 2011 we received marketing approval for Soliris for the treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States and European Union, respectively.  If Soliris is approved in other territories for the treatment of patients with aHUS, or for additional indications, we expect that the demand for Soliris will increase.  We may underestimate demand, or experience product interruptions at ARIMF, Lonza or a facility of a third party provider, including as a result of risks and uncertainties described in this report.  If we, Lonza or our other third party providers do not manufacture sufficient quantities of Soliris to satisfy demand, our business will be materially harmed.

Many additional factors could cause production interruptions at ARIMF or at the facilities of Lonza or our third party providers, including natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, human error, equipment malfunctions, contamination, or raw material shortages.  The occurrence of any such event could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for Soliris, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.



We are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or significant reduction or cancellation in sales to, any one of these customers could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.





If we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to successfully commercialize Soliris.



We are marketing and selling Soliris ourselves in the United States, Europe, Japan and several other territories.  If we are










If we market Soliris in a manner that violates health care fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.



In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care “fraud and abuse” laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations.  Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally or state financed health care programs.  This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other.  Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.  Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, or "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.  Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would also harm our financial condition.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and because government scrutiny in this area is high, it is possible that some of our business activities could come under that scrutiny.

In recent years, several states and localities, including California, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada,








New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities.  Similar legislation is being considered in other states.  Additionally, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal government has enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions.  Beginning in 2013, the Sunshine provisions require manufacturers to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals.  Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear.  Nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity.



Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates, Including Eculizumab for Indications Other than PNH and aHUS



None of our product candidates except for Soliris has received regulatory approvals. Soliris has not been approved for any indication other than for the treatment of patients with PNH and aHUS. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, including Soliris for other indications, our business may be adversely affected.



Outside the United States, our ability to market any of our potential products is dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities.  These foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above.  If we are unable to receive regulatory approvals, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates, and our business may be adversely affected.



Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development.



Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional studies or trials for our product candidates, that if further studies or trials are initiated what the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed, or that if these further studies or trials are completed, that the design or results will provide a sufficient basis to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to commercialize products.  Results of clinical trials could be inconclusive, requiring additional or repeat trials.  If the design or results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to regulatory approval of our product candidates, our company could be materially adversely affected.  Failure of a clinical trial to achieve its pre-specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies or trials will be required if we determine to continue development of the product candidate, reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate, and may decrease the chances for successfully achieving the primary endpoint in scientifically similar indications.



There are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.



For human trials, patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical indication.  In addition, to ensure safety and effectiveness, the effect of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time, especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying.  Many of our programs focus on diseases with small patient populations and insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program.  We may decide to abandon development of a product candidate at any time due to unfavorable results or other reasons, or we may have to spend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either








of which would increase costs and delay any revenue from those product candidates, if any.

Additional factors that can cause delay, impairment or termination of our clinical trials or our product development efforts include:



•slow patient enrollment, including, for example, due to the rarity of the disease being studied;

•long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness;

•lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;

•disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites;

•adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients;

•the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials;

•insufficient clinical trial data to support effectiveness of the product candidates;

•lack of effectiveness or safety of the product candidate being tested;

•lack of sufficient funds;

•inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and

•failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the approvals for the facilities in which such product candidate is manufactured.



The regulatory approval process is costly and lengthy and we may not be able to successfully obtain all required regulatory approvals.



•failure of our product candidates to meet a regulatory agency's requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;

•limitation on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed;

•unforeseen safety issues or side effects; and

•governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.



Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and health care payers.

Physicians may elect not to recommend our drugs even if they receive marketing approval for a variety of reasons, including the timing of the market introduction of competitive drugs; lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs; perceived lack of cost-effectiveness; lack of availability of reimbursement from third-party payers; convenience and ease of administration; prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and ineffective marketing and distribution support.  Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid in the United States and similar programs in other countries, and other third-party payers.  These health insurance programs may restrict coverage of some products by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co-payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by using utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment.  Payers may especially impose these obstacles to








coverage for higher-priced drugs, and consequently our drug candidates may be subject to payer-driven restrictions.  In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed.  The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.  For example, countries in the European Union may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use.  A member state may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.  The reimbursement or budget identified by a government or non-government payer for Soliris in a new indication, if obtained, may be adversely affected by the reimbursement or budget for Soliris in previously approved indications and/or adversely affect the reimbursement or budget for Soliris in such previously approved indication by that payer.



Inability to contract with third-party manufacturers and other third party providers on commercially reasonable terms, or failure or delay by us or our third-party manufacturers or other third party providers to provide services with respect to our drug products in the volumes and quality required, would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Manufacture of drug products, including the need to develop and utilize manufacturing processes that consistently produce our drug products to their required quality specifications, is highly regulated by the FDA and other domestic and foreign authorities.  Regulatory authorities must approve the facilities in which our products are manufactured vialed, packaged and labeled prior to granting marketing approval for any product candidate.  Such facilities are also subject to ongoing inspections, and minor changes in manufacturing or other related processes may require additional regulatory approvals.  We cannot assure you that we or our third-party providers will successfully comply with all requirements and regulations, which failure could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We currently have limited experience in manufacturing drug products in volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. We acquired ARIMF in July 2006.  The E.C. and the FDA have approved the use of ARIMF for the production of Soliris, and we are authorized to sell Soliris manufactured in our facility in the United States, the European Union and certain other territories.  The plant is not currently approved by the MHLW in Japan or other regulatory agencies to manufacture Soliris and we will not be capable of manufacturing Soliris for commercial sale in Japan on our own until such time as we have received MHLW approval of our manufacturing facility, if ever.  We are still entirely dependent on a single third party for commercial quantities of Soliris for sale in Japan and only one third party provider for global vialing.  We have limited experience in developing commercial-scale manufacturing.  We can provide no assurance that we will be able to manufacture our drug products at ARIMF under conditions required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies on a timely basis, if at all.  ARIMF is subject to approval by other national and regional regulatory agencies before we can begin sales of Soliris or other drug products manufactured in this facility in the applicable countries or regions, and we will continue to be subject to ongoing regulatory inspections thereafter.

We, and our third party providers, may experience higher failure rates than in the past if and when we attempt to increase production volume.  If we experience interruptions in the manufacture our supply of our products, our drug development and commercialization efforts will be delayed.  If any of our outside third party providers stops manufacturing or supplying our products or reduces the amount manufactured or supplied, or is otherwise unable to provide our required amounts at our required quality, we may need to find other alternatives, which is likely to be expensive and time consuming, and also may result in reduced revenue during this period.  Even if we are able to find alternatives they may ultimately be








insufficient for our needs.  As a result, our ability to conduct testing and drug trials and our plans for commercialization could be materially adversely affected.  Submission of products and new development programs for regulatory approval, as well as our plans for commercialization, would be delayed or suspended.  Our competitive position and our prospects for achieving or maintaining profitability could be materially and adversely affected.

Due to the nature of the current market for third-party commercial manufacturing, many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity for which it contracted.  Penalty payments under these agreements typically decrease over the life of the agreement, and may be substantial initially and de minimis or non-existent in the final period.  The payment of a substantial penalty could harm our financial condition.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property



If we cannot obtain new patents, maintain our existing patents and protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our business and competitive position will be harmed.



In order to protect our drugs and technology more effectively, we need to obtain and maintain patents covering the drugs and technologies we develop.  We have and may in the future obtain patents or the right to practice patents through ownership or license.  Our patent applications may not result in the issue of patents in the United States or other countries. Our patents may not afford adequate protection for our products. Third parties may challenge our patents.  If any of our patents are narrowed, invalidated or become unenforceable, competitors may develop and market products similar to ours that do not conflict with or infringe our patents rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  We may also finance and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational or research institutions.  Such research partners may be unwilling to grant us exclusive rights to technology or products developed through such collaborations.  There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties.  Soliris and our drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming to test and develop. Even if we obtain and maintain patents, our business may be significantly harmed if the patents are not broad enough to protect our drugs from copycat products.

In addition, our business requires using sensitive technology, techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets.  However, we may also rely heavily on collaboration with, or discuss the potential for collaboration with, suppliers, outside scientists and other drug companies.  Collaboration and discussion of potential collaboration present a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets.  If our trade secrets were exposed, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business prospects.



If we are found to be infringing on patents owned by others, we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and/or obtain a license to continue the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs, including Soliris, which would adversely affect our business.



•Soliris and our product candidates do not infringe the patents;

•the patents are not valid; or








•we have identified and tested or are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit commercialization of our product candidates.



Any holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling or developing our drugs.  Legal disputes can be costly and time consuming to defend.  If we cannot successfully defend against any future actions or conflicts, if they arise, we may incur substantial legal costs and may be liable for damages, be required to obtain costly licenses or need to stop manufacturing, using or selling Soliris, which would adversely affect our business.  We may seek to obtain a license prior to or during legal actions in order to reduce further costs and the risk of a court determination that our product infringes the third party's patents.  A required license may be costly or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

There can be no assurance that we would prevail in a patent infringement action or that we would be able to obtain a license to any third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms or any terms at all; successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis; or license alternative non-infringing technology, if any exists, on commercially reasonable terms.  Any impediment to our ability to manufacture, use or sell approved forms of Soliris or our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.



Risks Related to Our Operations



We have had a history of losses and cannot guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals, including our ability to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.





If our competitors get to the marketplace before we do, or with better or less expensive drugs, it may not be profitable to continue to produce Soliris and our product candidates.



The FDA, E.C. and the MHLW granted orphan drug designation for Soliris in the treatment of PNH and the FDA and E.C. granted orphan drug designation for aHUS.  Orphan drug status which entitles us to exclusivity for a total of seven years in the United States and for ten years in Europe and Japan.  However, if a competitive product that is the same as Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, is shown to be clinically superior to Soliris in the treatment of the stated disease, or if a competitive product is different from Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, the orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained may not block the approval of such competitive product.  Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies








throughout the world have programs to develop complement inhibitor therapies or have publicly announced their intentions to develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system.  These and other companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, may develop, manufacture, and market better or cheaper drugs than Soliris or our product candidates.  They may establish themselves in the marketplace before us for Soliris for other indications or for any of our other product candidates.  Other pharmaceutical companies also compete with us to attract academic research institutions as drug development partners, including for licensing these institutions' proprietary technology. If our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions, we will be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent opportunities elsewhere.



If we fail to satisfy our debt service obligations or obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue the commercialization of Soliris or continue or complete our product development.

Additional financing could take the form of public or private debt or equity offerings, equity line facilities, bank loans, including additional borrowing under our existing credit facility, collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners and/or the sale or licensing of some of our property.  The amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including:



•the cost necessary to sell, market and distribute Soliris;

•the rate of new patient sales and drug utilization by treated patients;

•the time and cost necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Soliris in multiple countries;

•the ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement approvals and funding for Soliris and the time necessary to obtain such approvals and funding;

•the time and cost necessary to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities outside the United States;

•the time and cost necessary to purchase or to further develop manufacturing processes, arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing facilities and obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities;

•changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies or requests by regulatory agencies for additional information or data;

•the progress, timing and scope of our research and development programs;

•the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;

•the integration of the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec businesses;

•any new collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish; and

•the cost of any acquisition.



We may not receive additional funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms.  Financial markets in the United States, Europe and the rest of the world have been experiencing significant volatility in security prices, substantially diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to access additional credit or the equity markets in order to finance our operations, grow our operations in any territory, or expand development programs for our product candidates, or that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in economies.  If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay, scale-back or eliminate our research and development activities








or future operations.  We might have to license our technology to others or relinquish commercialization rights.  This could result in sharing revenues that we might otherwise retain for ourselves.  Any of these actions would harm our business.



If we fail to recruit and retain personnel, we may not be able to implement our business strategy.

We are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel, particularly Dr. Leonard Bell, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Stephen P. Squinto, Ph.D., our Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development.  There is intense competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel.  Since our business is science-oriented and specialized, we need to continue to attract and retain such people.  We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business.  We have employment agreements with Dr. Bell and Dr. Squinto.  None of our key personnel is nearing retirement age or to our knowledge, planning to retire.  To our knowledge, there is no tension between any of our key personnel and the Board of Directors.  If we are unable to retain and recruit highly qualified personnel, our ability to execute our business plan will be materially and adversely affected.

In particular, we highly value the services of Dr. Bell, our Chief Executive Officer.  The loss of his services could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our objectives.



We are significantly leveraged.

The Facilities, and the contingent consideration payable in connection with our acquisitions remain outstanding or available, and the degree to which we are leveraged could, among other things:

•make it difficult for us to make payments on the Facilities;

•make it difficult for us to obtain financing for additional acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities or other purposes on favorable terms, if at all;

•make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures; and

•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.



We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.



We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including our manufacturing operations at ARIMF, the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, such as medical and biological wastes, and emissions and discharges into the environment, such as air, soils and water sources.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities.  We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations to which wastes were sent from its








facilities, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or necessarily caused, the contamination.  Such obligations and liabilities, which to date have not been material, could have a material impact on our business and financial condition.



We may expand our business through acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.



Our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities.  In 2011, we acquired Taligen and certain assets of Orphatec.  In February 2012 we acquired Enobia.  We may seek additional acquisitions or in-licensing of businesses or products to expand our products and capabilities.  Acquisitions of new businesses or products, including the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, and in-licensing of new products involve numerous risks, including:



•substantial cash expenditures;

•potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;

•incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;

•difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies;

•diverting our management's attention away from other business concerns;

•risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;

•the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies; and

•failure of any acquired businesses or products or in-licensed products to achieve the scientific, medical, commercial or other results anticipated.

We have limited experience in the acquisition and integration of other companies.  We cannot assure you that the Enobia, Taligen and Orphatec acquisitions, or any other acquisition or in-licensing of new products, will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us.  We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business, such as Enobia, Taligen or Orphatec, or an acquired or in-licensed product.  In addition, the future success of such transactions would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with any such acquisitions or in-licensing.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of Enobia, Taligen or Orphatec, or any other acquired businesses or companies work or be successful.

We compete with pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater resources than we for many of the same acquisition and in-licensing opportunities.  Such pharmaceutical companies may be less leveraged and have better access to capital resources that may preclude us from completing any acquisition or in-licensing.  For this and other reasons, we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.  Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business, any acquired business or any acquired or in-licensed products may require a substantial capital investment by us.  We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders' ownership interest in our company, or securities convertible into our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders' ownership interest in our company upon conversion.



Our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of Alexion, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.



As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $464.9 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOL's), available to reduce taxable income in future years.  Included in our U.S. federal net operating losses is approximately $36.5 million associated with the acquisition of Taligen.  A portion of these NOL's are currently subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  We believe it is more likely than not that we will use the majority of net operating losses.  However, the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income.  The net operating loss carryforwards may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income.

Our ability to utilize the NOL's may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change, as defined in section 382.  This ownership change could be triggered by substantial changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock, which are generally outside of our control.  An ownership change would exist if the stockholders, or group of stockholders, who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the value of our stock, or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under section 382 and the regulations promulgated there under, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change.  In the event of an ownership








change, section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change NOL's.  The limitation imposed by section 382 for any post-change year would be determined by multiplying the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate.  Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built-in gains which may be present with respect to assets held by us at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five-year period after the ownership change.  Our use of NOL's arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected.



We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.



As a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities.  Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements.  If the Internal Revenue Service, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions taken by our company, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, the United States government and other governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Our sales and operations are subject to the economic, political, legal and business conditions in the countries in which we do business, and our failure to operate successfully or adapt to changes in these conditions could cause our sales and operations to be limited or disrupted.



Since 2007, we have significantly expanded our operations and expect to continue to do so in the future.  Our operations in foreign countries subject us to the following additional risks:

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•political or economic determinations that adversely impact pricing or reimbursement policies;

•economic problems or political instability that disrupt health care payment systems;

•difficulties or inability to obtain financing in markets;

•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;

•difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;

•changes in laws, regulations or enforcement practices with respect to our business, including without limitation laws relating to reimbursement, competition, pricing and sales and marketing of our products;

•trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities;

•compliance with tax, employment and labor laws;

•costs and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and employees to manage and operate the business in local jurisdictions;

•costs and difficulties in managing and monitoring international operations; and

•longer payment cycles.

Our business and marketing methods are also subject to regulation by the governments of the countries in which we operate. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in other countries prohibit companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We have policies and procedures designed to help ensure that we and our representatives, including our employees, comply with such laws, however we cannot guarantee that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws for actions taken by our representatives.  Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate could materially harm our business.

We conduct, or anticipate that we will conduct, a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than the US dollar.  We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of our business.  The exposures result from portions of our revenues, as well as the related receivables, and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.  We manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives. All of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes, and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. We enter








into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of up to 36 months, to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The purpose of the hedges of intercompany revenue is to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues.  Further, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts, with durations of approximately 30 days, designed to limit the balance sheet exposure of monetary assets and liabilities. We enter into these hedges to reduce the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on our operating results.  Gains and losses on these hedge transactions are designed to offset gains and losses on underlying balance sheet exposures.  While we attempt to hedge certain currency risks, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the past and will likely do so in the future.  Likewise, past currency fluctuations have at times resulted in foreign currency transaction gains, and there can be no assurance that these gains can be reproduced.  See also Footnote 7, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



The credit and financial market conditions may aggravate certain risks affecting our business.



We continue to monitor economic conditions, including volatility associated with international economies, associated impacts on the financial markets and our business, and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.  The credit and economic conditions in Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal, among other members of the European Union have deteriorated throughout 2011.  These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries.  We have recorded a reserve related to receivables in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal that have been outstanding for greater than one year as of December 31, 2011.

We may not be able to successfully mitigate or prevent our exposures due to volatile economic and financial conditions and our failure to operate successfully or adapt to changes in these conditions could cause our sales and operations to be limited or disrupted or otherwise harm our business.

Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including Lonza, licensees, wholesale distributors of Soliris, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and other third-party suppliers and financial institutions.  Because of the volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.



Government initiatives that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products could adversely affect our business.

Governments in countries where we operate have adopted or have shown significant interest in pursuing legislative initiatives to reduce costs of health care, such as the Affordable Care Act adopted in the United States in March 2011.  Any such government-adopted health care measures could adversely impact the pricing of Soliris or the amount of coverage and reimbursement available for Soliris from governmental agencies or other third-party payers.  For example, the governments of Germany and Spain each approved increases to mandatory rebates on the sales of pharmaceutical products.  The pricing and reimbursement environment for Soliris may become more challenging due to, among other reasons, changes in government policies or new legislation, or the impact of total Soliris reimbursement to any one payer.  In many cases, these government initiatives, even if enacted into law, are subject to future rulemaking by regulatory agencies.  Although we have evaluated these








government initiatives and the impact on our business, we cannot know with certainty whether any such law, rule or regulation will adversely affect coverage and reimbursement of Soliris, or to what extent, until such laws, rules and regulations are promulgated, implemented and enforced.  The announcement or adoption of regulatory or legislative proposals could delay or prevent our entry into new markets, affect our reimbursement or sales in the markets where we are already selling Soliris and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, customers and business partners, and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business.

Natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, shipping embargos, labor unrest or political instability, could adversely affect our operations, including our ability to supply and commercialize Soliris.

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the effects of these natural disasters, as well as acts of war or terrorism, shipping embargos, labor unrest or political instability could disrupt our operations, or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers.  Such events could adversely impact our facilities, or interfere with the manufacture or distribution of Soliris.



Risks Related to Our Common Stock



If the trading price of our common stock continues to fluctuate in a wide range, our stockholders will suffer considerable uncertainty with respect to an investment in our common stock.

The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors' operating results or clinical or scientific results, fluctuations in the trading prices or business prospects of our competitors and collaborators, changes in our prospects, particularly with respect to sales of Soliris, and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock.  In particular, the trading price of the common stock of many biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected.  This is due to several factors, including general market conditions, sales of Soliris, the announcement of the results of our clinical trials or product development and the results of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for our products.  While we cannot predict our future performance, if our stock price continues to fluctuate in a wide range, an investment in our common stock may result in considerable uncertainty for an investor.



Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholders' rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management.



Because we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Laws, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

Our corporate charter and by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control that might be beneficial to us or our stockholders.  Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, or a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the written request of stockholders who together own of record 50% of the outstanding stock of all classes entitled to vote at such meeting.  Our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors.  Our charter does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors, which may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to elect








one or more directors.  Under our charter, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to designate up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series.  The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.

Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock has an associated preferred stock purchase right.  The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock.  The rights are designed to make it more likely that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard against the use of partial tender offers or other coercive tactics to gain control of us.  These provisions could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices.  These provisions could also limit the ability of stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that stockholders may deem to be in their best interests and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
