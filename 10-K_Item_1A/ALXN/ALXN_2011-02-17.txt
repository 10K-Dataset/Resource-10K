Item 1A.Risk Factors.

You should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in our Company and our business because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating
results, financial condition, and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Lead Product Soliris

We depend heavily on the success of our
lead product, Soliris. If we are unable to increase sales of Soliris or obtain approval or commercialize Soliris in new territories for the treatment of PNH or for additional indications, or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so,
our business may be materially harmed.

Our ability to generate revenues will depend on commercial success of Soliris
in the United States, Europe and throughout the rest of the world and whether physicians, patients and healthcare payors view Soliris as therapeutically effective and safe relative to cost. Since we launched Soliris in the United States in April
2007, almost all of our revenue has been attributed to sales of Soliris, and we expect that Soliris product sales will continue to contribute to a significant percentage or almost all of our total revenue over the next several years.

We dedicate significant resources to the worldwide expansion of the commercialization of Soliris for the treatment of PNH. We have
established sales and marketing capabilities, and are commercializing Soliris in many countries throughout the world. In certain countries, including Canada and certain countries in the European Union, we continue discussions with authorities to
finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes so that we may, upon conclusion of such discussions, commence commercial sales in those countries. We have submitted applications for marketing authorization of Soliris for
the treatment of PNH in additional territories. We cannot guarantee that any such marketing application will be approved in all countries where we seek authorization to sell Soliris for the treatment of PNH, or even if approved, that we will be able
to obtain reimbursement for Soliris or that we will be able to successfully commercialize Soliris in any additional countries. As a result, sales in certain countries may be delayed or never occur, or may be subsequently reduced.

In November 2010 we announced that two Phase II clinical studies investigating Soliris as a treatment for patients with aHUS who are
resistant to plasma therapy met primary and key secondary endpoints. We cannot guarantee that the data from such studies will be sufficient to proceed with the filing of a BLA for Soliris for the treatment of aHUS. The FDA and other regulatory
agencies may have varying interpretations of our clinical trial data, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval or clearance. Even if the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities do grant marketing approval of Soliris for the treatment
of aHUS, they may impose restrictions on the use or marketing of the product, or may require us to conduct additional post-marketing trials. A narrowed indication or other restrictions may limit the market potential for Soliris for the treatment of
aHUS.

The commercial success of Soliris and our ability to generate and increase revenues will depend on several factors,
including the following:



•receipt of marketing approvals for Soliris for the treatment of PNH in new territories and the maintenance of marketing approvals for the treatment of
PNH in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories;



•receipt and maintenance of marketing approvals for Soliris for the treatment of aHUS from United States and foreign regulatory authorities,



•the number of patients with PNH and, if approved for the treatment of aHUS, aHUS, who are diagnosed with the disease and identified to us;







•the number of patients with PNH and aHUS that may be treated with Soliris;



•successful continuation of commercial sales in the United States, Japan and in European countries where we are already selling Soliris for the
treatment of PNH, and successful launch in countries where we have not yet obtained, or only recently obtained, marketing approval or commenced sales;



•ability to obtain and maintain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors;



•acceptance of Soliris in the medical community;



•establishment and maintenance of commercial manufacturing capabilities ourselves or through third-party manufacturers; and



•our ability to develop, register and commercialize Soliris for indications other than PNH, including aHUS.

If we are not successful in increasing sales of Soliris in the United States, Europe and Japan and commercializing in the rest of the
world, or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, we may experience a surplus inventory, our business may be materially harmed and we may need to significantly curtail operations.

Because the target patient populations of Soliris for the treatment of PNH and aHUS are small and have not been definitively determined, we must be able to successfully identify patients and achieve
a significant market share in order to achieve or maintain profitability.

Soliris has been approved for the treatment
of PNH and we are advancing our efforts to seek marketing approval of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS. PNH and aHUS are each ultra-rare diseases with small patient populations that have not been definitively determined. There can be no guarantee
that any of our programs will be effective at identifying patients and the number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected or may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with Soliris, all of which
would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.

If we are unable to obtain, or maintain at anticipated levels,
reimbursement for Soliris from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, our pricing may be affected or our product sales, results of operations or financial condition could be harmed.

We may not be able to sell Soliris on a profitable basis or our profitability may be reduced if we are required to
sell our product at lower than anticipated prices or reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount. Soliris is significantly more expensive than traditional drug treatments and almost all patients require some form of third party
coverage to afford its cost. Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on governmental, private third-party payors and other third-party payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States or country
specific governmental organizations, to defray the cost of Soliris to the patient. If these entities refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to Soliris, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and reimbursement than
anticipated, or reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, including in the form of higher mandatory rebates, then our pricing or reimbursement for Soliris may be affected and our product sales, results of operations or
financial condition could be harmed.

In certain countries where we are seeking or may seek to commercialize Soliris, pricing,
coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us, or such coverage, pricing, and reimbursement may
differ in separate regions in the same country. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country, and we
cannot guarantee that we will have the capabilities or resources to successfully conclude the necessary processes and commercialize Soliris in every or even most countries in which we seek to sell Soliris. Reimbursement sources are different in each
country and in each







country may include a combination of distinct potential payors, including private insurance and governmental payors. For example, countries in the European Union may restrict the range of
medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may from time to time approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it
may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to successfully and timely conclude reimbursement, price
approval or funding processes and begin to market Soliris in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for Soliris in foreign countries is limited. If we are not able to obtain coverage, pricing or reimbursement on terms acceptable to us or
at all, or if such terms should change in any foreign countries, we may not be able to or we may determine not to sell Soliris in such countries, or we could decide to sell Soliris at a lower than anticipated price in such countries, and our
revenues may be adversely affected as a result.

Many third-party payors cover only selected drugs, making drugs that are not preferred by such payor more expensive for patients, and
require prior authorization or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug. Third-party payors may be especially likely to impose these obstacles to coverage for higher-priced drugs such as Soliris.

Even in countries where patients have access to insurance, their insurance co-payment amounts or annual or lifetime caps on
reimbursements may represent a barrier to obtaining or continuing Soliris. In the United States, we have financially supported non-profit organizations, such as the PNH Fund of the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) which assist
patients in accessing treatment for PNH, including Soliris. Such organizations assist patients whose insurance coverage leaves them with prohibitive co-payment amounts or other expensive financial obligations. NORD’s, and other similar
organizations’, ability to provide assistance to PNH patients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at adequate levels, if at all. We have also provided Soliris without charge
to patients who have no insurance coverage for drugs for related charitable purposes in the United States and elsewhere. We are not able to predict the financial impact of the support we may provide for these and other charitable purposes; however,
substantial support could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future.

We are also focusing development
efforts on the use of eculizumab for the treatment of diseases other than PNH, including for the treatment of aHUS. The success of these programs depends on many factors, including those described under the heading “Risks Related to
Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates, including Eculizumab for Indications Other than PNH.” If eculizumab is approved by regulatory agencies for indications other than PNH, the potential increase in
the number of patients receiving Soliris may cause third party payers to refuse coverage or reimbursement for Soliris for the treatment of PNH or provide a lower level of coverage or reimbursement than is currently in effect.







We may not be able to gain or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients,
which would prevent us from maintaining profitability in the future.

We cannot be certain that Soliris will gain or
maintain market acceptance in a particular country among physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and others. Although we have received regulatory approval for Soliris in certain territories, including the United States, Japan and Europe, such
approvals do not guarantee future revenue. We cannot predict whether physicians, other healthcare providers, government agencies or private insurers will determine or continue to accept that Soliris is safe and therapeutically effective relative to
its cost. Medical doctors’ willingness to prescribe, and patients’ willingness to accept, Soliris depends on many factors, including prevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use, effectiveness
of our marketing strategy and the pricing of Soliris, publicity concerning Soliris, our other product candidates or competing products, our ability to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or reimbursement, and availability of alternative
treatments, including bone marrow transplant as an alternative treatment for PNH. If Soliris fails to achieve or maintain market acceptance among the medical community or patients in a particular country, we may not be able to market and sell it
successfully in such country, which would limit our ability to generate revenue and could harm our overall business.

If we or our
contract manufacturers fail to comply with continuing United States and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market Soliris or our manufacturers could lose their approvals to manufacture Soliris, and our business would be seriously
harmed.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our regulatory approvals for Soliris. If we do not
maintain our regulatory approvals for Soliris, the value of our company and our results of operations will be materially harmed. We and our current and future partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive
regulation by the FDA other federal and state agencies, and governmental authorities in other territories. These regulations continue to apply after product approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling,
advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, adverse event reporting requirements, and export of biologics. For example, the risk management program established in 2007 upon the FDA’s approval of Soliris for the treatment of PNH was replaced with a
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program (REMS) program, approved by the FDA in 2010. The REMS program requires mandatory physician certification in the United States. Each physician must certify that the physician is aware of the potential
risks associated with the administration of Soliris and that the physician will inform each patient of these risks using educational material approved by the FDA.







Failure to comply with the laws and requirements, including statutes and regulations,
administered by the FDA, the EMA, MHLW or other agencies could result in:



•administrative and judicial sanctions, including, warning letters;



•fines and other civil penalties;



•withdrawal of a previously granted approval for Soliris;



•interruption of production;



•operating restrictions;



•delays in approving or refusal to approve Soliris or a facility that manufactures Soliris;



•product recall or seizure;



•injunctions; and



•criminal prosecution.

If the use of Soliris harms people, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to Soliris, our regulatory approvals could be
revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.

The
testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of drugs for use in humans exposes us to product liability risks. Side effects and other problems from using Soliris could (1) lessen the frequency with which physicians decide to prescribe Soliris,
(2) encourage physicians to stop prescribing Soliris to their patients who previously had been prescribed Soliris, (3) cause serious adverse events and give rise to product liability claims against us, and (4) result in our need to
withdraw or recall Soliris from the marketplace. Some of these risks are unknown at this time.

We may be sued by people who use Soliris, whether as a prescribed therapy, during a clinical trial, during an investigator initiated study, or otherwise. Many patients who use Soliris are already very
ill. Any informed consents or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our trials or use Soliris may not protect us from liability or litigation. Our product liability insurance may not cover all potential types of liabilities or may not cover
certain liabilities completely. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms. In addition, negative publicity relating to the use of Soliris or a product candidate, or to a product liability claim, may make it more
difficult, or impossible, for us to market and sell Soliris. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.







Patients who use Soliris already often have severe and advanced stages of disease and known
as well as unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks, including, for example, bone marrow failure. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may
not be related to Soliris. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market
Soliris, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to Soliris, the investigation into the circumstance may be time consuming or inconclusive.
These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals Soliris receives or maintains.

Some patients treated with Soliris for PNH or other diseases, including patients who have participated in our clinical trials, have died
or suffered potentially life-threatening diseases either during or after ending their Soliris treatments. In particular, use of C5 Inhibitors, such as Soliris, is associated with an increased risk for certain types of infection, including
Meningococcal infection. Serious cases of Meningococcal infection can result in severe illness, including but not limited to brain damage, loss of limbs or parts of limbs, kidney failure, or death. Patients in our eculizumab trials all receive
vaccination against Meningococcal infection prior to first administration of Soliris and patients who are prescribed Soliris in most countries are required by prescribing guidelines to be vaccinated prior to receiving their first dose; however,
vaccination does not eliminate all risk of Meningococcal infection. Some patients treated with Soliris who had been vaccinated have experienced Meningococcal infection, including patients who have suffered serious illness or death. Each such
incident is required to be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations.

We are also
aware of a potential risk for PNH patients who delay a dose of Soliris or discontinue their treatment of Soliris. Treatment with Soliris blocks complement and allows complement-sensitive PNH red blood cells to increase in
number. If treatment with Soliris is thereafter delayed or discontinued, a greater number of red blood cells therefore would become susceptible to destruction when the patient’s complement system is no longer blocked. The rapid
destruction of a larger number of a patient’s red blood cells may lead to numerous complications, including death. Several PNH patients in our studies of Soliris have received delayed doses or discontinued their treatment. In none of
those circumstances were significant complications shown to be due to rapid destruction of a larger number of PNH red blood cells; however, we have not studied the delay or termination of treatment in enough patients to determine that such
complications in the future are unlikely to occur. Additionally, such delays or discontinuations may be associated with significant complications without evidence of such rapid cell destruction. Clinical evaluations of outcomes in the
post-marketing setting are required to be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies in accordance with relevant regulations. Determination of significant complications associated with the delay or discontinuation of Soliris could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to sell Soliris for PNH.

Although we obtained regulatory approval to market and sell Soliris for PNH in
the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories, we cannot guarantee that we will obtain the regulatory approval or reimbursement approval for Soliris for the treatment of PNH or other diseases in each territory where we seek
approvals.

Governments in countries where we seek to commercialize Soliris regulate the distribution of drugs and the
facilities where such drugs are manufactured, and obtaining their approvals can be lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain. The approval process varies from country to country, and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product
manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes prior to marketing our products,
even in countries where marketing approval has been obtained. Soliris became commercially available in certain countries in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2007. We received regulatory approval for Soliris for treatment of patients with PNH in the
United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories. We may not receive regulatory approval for Soliris in any other territories for at least the next several years, if ever.







Regulatory agencies may require additional information or data with respect to our
submissions for Soliris. We may have to conduct additional lengthy clinical testing and other costly and time-consuming procedures to satisfy foreign regulatory agencies. Even with approval of Soliris in certain countries, the regulatory agencies in
other countries may not agree with our interpretations of our clinical trial data for Soliris and may decide that our results are not adequate to support approval for marketing of Soliris. In those circumstances, we would not be able to obtain
regulatory approval in such country on a timely basis, if ever. Even if approval is granted in such country, the approval may require limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed. The foreign regulatory approval process
includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as country-specific regulations. We must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of
the product in those countries. For example, we were required to conduct clinical studies with Soliris in patients with PNH in Japan prior to obtaining marketing approval in that country.

Our commercialization of Soliris may be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if we or any other supply vendor fails to provide sufficient quantities of Soliris. Commercial quantities of Soliris
can only be manufactured at two facilities, including our own facility in Rhode Island. We are currently entirely dependent on a single third party to manufacture commercial quantities of Soliris for sale in Japan.

Commercial quantities of Soliris are manufactured by us at our Rhode Island manufacturing facility and by Lonza Sales AG (Lonza).
Manufacturing processes must comply with applicable regulations and manufacturing practices, as well as our own quality standards. In particular, the manufacture of Soliris is heavily regulated by governmental authorities around the world, including
the FDA, EMA and MHLW. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply fully with such regulations then there could be a government-enforced shutdown of production facilities or production lines, which in turn could lead to product shortages.

The manufacture of Soliris is difficult. Manufacture of a biologic requires a multi-step controlled process and even minor
problems or deviations could result in defects or failures. We cannot be certain that we or Lonza will be able to perform uninterrupted supply chain services. The failure to manufacture appropriate supplies of Soliris, on a timely basis, or at all,
may prevent or interrupt the commercialization of Soliris. If we or Lonza were unable to manufacture Soliris for any period, or if we do not obtain approval of our facility by the applicable regulatory agencies, we may incur substantial loss of
sales. If we are forced to find an alternative supplier for Soliris, in addition to loss of sales, we may also incur significant costs and experience significant delay in establishing a new arrangement.

Until December 2009, only Lonza was capable of manufacturing commercial quantities of Soliris. The E.C. and the FDA approved the use of
our Rhode Island manufacturing facility for the production of Soliris in December 2009 and August 2010, respectively. We are authorized to sell product that is manufactured in our facility in the United States, the European Union and certain other
territories. However, we will not be capable of manufacturing Soliris at our own facility in Rhode Island for commercial sale in Japan or other territories until such time as we have received the required regulatory approval for our facility, if
ever. We will continue to depend entirely on one company, Lonza, to manufacture Soliris for commercial sale in Japan and such other territories until that time.

We also depend on a limited number of outside vendors for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial requirements, including product finishing, packaging, vialing and labeling. We do not
have control over any third-party manufacturer’s, vialer’s or other third party provider’s compliance with the rules and regulations of the FDA, EMA, MHLW or any other applicable regulations or standards. Any difficulties or delays in
our third party manufacturing and supply of Soliris and other product candidates, or any failure of our third party providers to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase our costs, constrain our ability to
satisfy demand for Soliris from customers, cause us to lose revenue or incur penalties for failure to deliver product, make us postpone or cancel clinical trials, or cause our products to be recalled or withdrawn.







We are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the
loss of, or significant reduction or cancellation in sales to, any one of these customers could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

If we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so, we will be unable to successfully
commercialize Soliris.

If we market Soliris in a manner that violates health care fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care “fraud and abuse” laws, such
as the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering,
paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service







reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally or state financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers
on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe
harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the
federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as
allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set
reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, or “off-label” uses, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the
Medicaid Rebate Program.

Although physicians are permitted to, based on their medical judgment, prescribe products for
indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. We market Soliris for PNH and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians
regarding the use of Soliris for PNH. Although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute off-label promotion of Soliris, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials,
training or other activities constitute off-label promotion of Soliris, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning
letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment
of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is later determined we are not in violation of these laws,
we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state
programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal
fines, and imprisonment. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would also harm our
financial condition. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and because government scrutiny in this area is high, it is possible that some of our business activities could come under that scrutiny.

In recent years, several states and localities, including California, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico,
Vermont, and West Virginia, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical
trials, and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. Additionally, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal government has enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions. Beginning
in 2013, the Sunshine provisions require manufacturers to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements
are unclear. Nonetheless, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity.







Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product
Candidates, Including Eculizumab for Indications Other than PNH

None of our product candidates except for Soliris has received
regulatory approvals. Soliris has not been approved for any indication other than for the treatment of patients with PNH. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, including Soliris for other
indications, our business may be adversely affected.

Outside the United States, our ability to market any
of our potential products is dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities. These foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above. If
we are unable to receive regulatory approvals, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates, and our business may be adversely affected.

Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development.

Completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee that we will initiate additional studies or trials for our product candidates, that if further studies or trials are initiated what
the scope and phase of the trial will be or that they will be completed, or that if these further studies or trials are completed, that the design or results will provide a sufficient basis to apply for or receive regulatory approvals or to
commercialize products. Results of clinical trials could be inconclusive, requiring additional or repeat trials. If the design or results achieved in our clinical trials are insufficient to proceed to further trials or to regulatory approval of our
product candidates, our company could be materially adversely affected. Failure of a clinical trial to achieve its pre-specified primary endpoint generally increases the likelihood that additional studies or trials will be required if we determine
to continue development of the product candidate, reduces the likelihood of timely development of and regulatory approval to market the product candidate, and may decrease the chances for successfully achieving the primary endpoint in scientifically
similar indications.

In November 2010 we announced that two Phase II clinical studies investigating Soliris as a treatment
for patients with aHUS who are resistant to plasma therapy met primary and key secondary endpoints. We cannot guarantee that the data from such studies will be sufficient to proceed with the filing of a BLA and regulatory agencies may have varying
interpretations of the clinical trial data, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval or clearance.







There are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated.

For human trials, patients must be recruited and each product candidate must be tested at various doses and formulations for each clinical
indication. In addition, to ensure safety and effectiveness, the effect of drugs often must be studied over a long period of time, especially for the chronic diseases that we are studying. Many of our programs focus on diseases with small patient
populations and insufficient patient enrollment in our clinical trials could delay or cause us to abandon a product development program. We may decide to abandon development of a product candidate at any time due to unfavorable results or other
reasons, or we may have to spend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either of which would increase costs and delay any revenue from those product candidates, if any.

During the first quarter of 2011, we acquired Taligen Therapeutics, Inc. and certain assets of Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH. We are
evaluating our clinical development strategies for the drug candidates acquired from Taligen and Orphatec, which may include additional preclinical testing and initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials.

Additional factors that can cause delay, impairment or termination of our clinical trials or our product development efforts include:



•slow patient enrollment, including, for example, due to the rarity of the disease being studied;



•long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness;



•lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;



•disruption of operations at the clinical trial sites;



•adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients;



•the failure of patients taking the placebo to continue to participate in our clinical trials;



•insufficient clinical trial data to support effectiveness of the product candidates;



•lack of effectiveness or safety of the product candidate being tested;



•lack of sufficient funds;



•inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient
manner; and



•failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the approvals for the facilities in which such product candidate is
manufactured.

The regulatory approval process is costly and lengthy and we may not be able to successfully obtain all
required regulatory approvals.

The preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of
pharmaceuticals are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities and agencies in the United States and other countries. We must obtain regulatory approval for each of our product candidates before marketing or selling any
of them. It is not possible to predict how long the approval processes of the FDA or any other applicable federal or foreign regulatory authority or agency for any of our product candidates will take or whether any such approvals ultimately will be
granted. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, and positive results in preclinical testing or early phases of clinical studies offer no assurance of success in later phases of the approval
process. The approval process varies from country to country and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Generally,
preclinical and clinical testing of product candidates can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit
or prevent regulatory approval. If we encounter significant delays in the regulatory process that result in







excessive costs, this may prevent us from continuing to develop our product candidates. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our
products and our ability to generate product revenue. The risks associated with the approval process include:



•failure of our product candidates to meet a regulatory agency’s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;



•limitation on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed;



•unforeseen safety issues or side effects; and



•governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.

Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and health care payors.

Inability to contract with third-party manufacturers and other third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or
failure or delay by us or our third-party manufacturers or other third party providers to provide services with respect to our drug products in the volumes and quality required, would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Clinical quantities of eculizumab are manufactured by us in our Rhode Island facility and by Lonza. Clinical
quantities of samalizumab are manufactured solely by us in Rhode Island. Manufacture of our drug products is highly technical, and only a small number of companies have the ability and capacity to manufacture our drug products for our development
and commercialization needs. Due to the highly technical requirements of manufacturing our drug products, we and our third-party collaborators may be unable to manufacture our drug products despite our and their efforts. In addition, we cannot be
certain that any third party will be able or willing to honor the terms of its agreement, including any obligations to manufacture the drug products in accordance with regulatory requirements and to our quality specifications and volume
requirements. Further, we have no experience manufacturing the drug candidates that we acquired from Taligen and Orphatec. We cannot guarantee that we or any third party will be able to manufacture such drug candidates, or that we or a third party
will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities to satisfy our requirements.







Manufacture of drug products, including the need to develop and utilize manufacturing
processes that consistently produce our drug products to their required quality specifications, is highly regulated by the FDA and other domestic and foreign authorities. Regulatory authorities must approve the facilities in which our products are
manufactured prior to granting marketing approval for any product candidate. Manufacturing facilities are also subject to ongoing inspections, and minor changes in manufacturing processes may require additional regulatory approvals. We cannot assure
you that we or our third-party collaborators will successfully comply with all requirements and regulations, which failure could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We, and our outside manufacturers, may experience higher manufacturing failure rates than in the past if and when we attempt
to substantially increase production volume. If we experience interruptions in the manufacture of our products, our drug development and commercialization efforts will be delayed. If any of our outside manufacturers stops manufacturing our products
or reduces the amount manufactured, or is otherwise unable to manufacture our required amounts at our required quality, we may need to find other alternatives, which is likely to be expensive and time consuming, and also may result in reduced
revenue during this period. Even if we are able to find alternatives they may ultimately be insufficient for our needs. As a result, our ability to conduct testing and drug trials and our plans for commercialization could be materially adversely
affected. Submission of products and new development programs for regulatory approval, as well as our plans for commercialization, would be delayed or suspended. Our competitive position and our prospects for achieving or maintaining profitability
could be materially and adversely affected.

Due to the nature of the current market for third-party commercial manufacturing,
many arrangements require substantial penalty payments by the customer for failure to use the manufacturing capacity for which it contracted. Penalty payments under these agreements typically decrease over the life of the agreement, and may be
substantial initially and de minimis or non-existent in the final period. The payment of a substantial penalty could harm our financial condition.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

If we cannot obtain new patents, maintain
our existing patents and protect the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our business and competitive position will be harmed.

In order to protect our drugs and technology more effectively, we need to obtain and maintain patents covering the drugs and technologies
we develop. We have and may in the future obtain patents or the right to practice patents through ownership or license. Our patent applications may not result in the issue of patents in the United States or other countries. Our patents may not
afford adequate protection for our products. Third parties







may challenge our patents. For example, a third party filed an opposition with the European Patent Office to our European Patent 0758904, which covers Soliris. The opposition argues that
essential claims in our European Patent 0758904 should be narrowed or invalidated. If any of our patents are narrowed, invalidated or become unenforceable, including European Patent 0758904, competitors may develop and market products similar to
ours that do not conflict with or infringe our patents rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We may also finance and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or
other educational or research institutions. Such research partners may be unwilling to grant us exclusive rights to technology or products developed through such collaborations. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to
technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. Soliris and our drug candidates are expensive and time-consuming to test and develop. Even if we obtain and maintain patents, our business may be significantly harmed if the
patents are not broad enough to protect our drugs from copycat products.

In addition, our business requires using sensitive
technology, techniques and proprietary compounds that we protect as trade secrets. However, we may also rely heavily on collaboration with, or discuss the potential for collaboration with, suppliers, outside scientists and other drug companies.
Collaboration and discussion of potential collaboration present a strong risk of exposing our trade secrets. If our trade secrets were exposed, it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business prospects.

If we are found to be infringing on patents owned by others, we may be forced to pay damages to the patent owner and/or obtain a license to
continue the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs. If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the manufacture, sale or development of our drugs, including Soliris, which would adversely affect our business.



•Soliris and our product candidates do not infringe the patents;



•the patents are not valid; or



•we have identified and tested or are testing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents and which should permit
commercialization of our product candidates.







Any holder of these patents or other patents covering similar technology could sue us for
damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling or developing our drugs. Legal disputes can be costly and time consuming to defend. If we cannot successfully defend against any future actions or conflicts, if they arise, we may incur
substantial legal costs and may be liable for damages, be required to obtain costly licenses or need to stop manufacturing, using or selling Soliris, which would adversely affect our business. A required license may be costly or may not be available
on acceptable terms, if at all. A costly license, or inability to obtain a necessary license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

There can be no assurance that we would prevail in a patent infringement action; that we would be able to obtain a license to any third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms or any terms at all;
successfully develop non-infringing alternatives on a timely basis; or license alternative non-infringing technology, if any exists, on commercially reasonable terms. Any impediment to our ability to manufacture, use or sell approved forms of
Soliris or our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.

Risks Related to Our
Operations

We have had a history of losses and cannot guarantee that we will achieve our financial goals, including our ability to
maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.

If our competitors get to the marketplace before we do, or with better or cheaper drugs, Soliris and our product candidates may not be profitable to continue to pursue.

The FDA, E.C. and the MHLW granted orphan drug designation for Soliris in the treatment of PNH, which entitles us to exclusivity for a
total of seven years in the United States and for ten years in Europe and Japan. However, if a competitive product that is the same as Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, is shown to be clinically superior to Soliris in the
treatment of PNH, or if a competitive product is different from Soliris, as defined under the applicable regulations, the orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained may not block the approval of such competitive product. Several biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies throughout the world have programs to develop complement inhibitor therapies or have publicly announced their intentions to







develop drugs which target the inflammatory effects of complement in the immune system. Other companies have publicly announced intentions to develop therapeutic human antibodies from libraries
of human antibody genes or therapeutic human antibodies from mice that have been bred to include some human antibody genes. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases
being targeted by us. These and other companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, may develop, manufacture, and market better or cheaper drugs than Soliris or our product candidates. They may establish themselves in the
marketplace before us for Soliris for other indications or for any of our other product candidates. Other pharmaceutical companies also compete with us to attract academic research institutions as drug development partners, including for licensing
these institutions’ proprietary technology. If our competitors successfully enter into such arrangements with academic institutions, we will be precluded from pursuing those unique opportunities and may not be able to find equivalent
opportunities elsewhere.

If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue the
commercialization of Soliris or continue or complete our product development.

We believe that revenues and collections
from sales of Soliris along with our existing cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations and product development for at least twelve months. We may need to raise additional capital before or after that time to
complete or continue the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates. We are currently selling or preparing for the commercialization of Soliris in the United States, Europe, Japan, and several other territories,
evaluating and preparing regulatory submissions for Soliris in several countries, and conducting, preparing or evaluating several clinical trials. Funding needs may shift between projects and potentially accelerate and increase as we continue launch
and commercialization activities throughout the world and as we initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates.

Additional financing could take the form of public or private debt or equity offerings, equity line facilities, bank loans, collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners
and/or the sale or licensing of some of our property. The amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including:



•the cost necessary to sell, market and distribute Soliris;



•the rate of new patient sales and drug utilization by treated patients;



•the time and cost necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Soliris and for eculizumab for other indications in multiple countries;



•the ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement approvals and funding for Soliris and the time necessary to obtain such approvals and funding;



•the time and cost necessary to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities outside the United States;



•the time and cost necessary to purchase or to further develop manufacturing processes, arrange for contract manufacturing or build manufacturing
facilities and obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for those facilities;



•changes in applicable governmental regulatory policies or requests by regulatory agencies for additional information or data;



•the progress, timing and scope of our research and development programs;



•the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;



•the integration of the Taligen and Orphatec business; and



•any new collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish.







We may not receive funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable
terms. Financial markets in the United States, Europe and the rest of the world have been experiencing significant volatility in security prices, substantially diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments
and declining valuations of others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access credit or equity markets in order to finance our operations in the United States, Europe or Japan, grow our operations in any territory, or expand
development programs for our product candidates, or that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in economies. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to delay,
scale-back or eliminate our research and development activities or future operations. We might have to license our technology to others or relinquish commercialization rights. This could result in sharing revenues that we might otherwise retain for
ourselves. Any of these actions would harm our business.

If we fail to recruit and retain personnel, we may not be able to implement
our business strategy.

We are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel,
particularly Dr. Leonard Bell, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Stephen P. Squinto, Ph.D., our Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development. There is intense competition in the
biopharmaceutical industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel. Since our business is science-oriented and specialized, we need to continue to attract and retain such people. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain the
qualified personnel necessary for developing our business. We have employment agreements with Dr. Bell and Dr. Squinto. None of our key personnel is nearing retirement age or to our knowledge, planning to retire. To our knowledge, there is
no tension between any of our key personnel and the Board of Directors. If we are unable to retain and recruit highly qualified personnel, our ability to execute our business plan will be materially and adversely affected.

In particular, we highly value the services of Dr. Bell, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of his services could materially and
adversely affect our ability to achieve our objectives.

We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental
liabilities.

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our
operations, including the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, including medical and biological wastes, and emissions and discharges into the environment, including air, soils and water sources. Failure to comply with such
laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances
into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating its property or locations to which wastes were sent from its facilities, without regard
to whether the owner or operator knew of, or necessarily caused, the contamination. Such obligations and liabilities, which to date have not been material, could have a material impact on our business and financial condition.

We may expand our business through acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.

Our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities. In the first quarter of 2010, we acquired
Taligen Therapeutics, Inc. and certain assets of Orphatec Pharmaceuticals GmbH and we may seek additional acquisitions or in-licensing of businesses or products to expand our product and capabilities. Acquisitions of new businesses or products,
including the acquisitions of Taligen and Orphatec, and in-licensing of new products involve numerous risks, including:



•substantial cash expenditures;



•potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;







•incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition;



•difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies;



•diverting our management’s attention away from other business concerns;



•risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;



•the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies; and



•failure of any acquired businesses or products or in-licensed products to achieve the scientific, medical, commercial or other results anticipated.

We have limited experience in the acquisition and integration of other companies. We cannot assure you that
the recent acquisitions of Taligen and Orphatec, or any other acquisition or in-licensing of new products, will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business, such as
Taligen or Orphatec, or an acquired or in-licensed product. In addition, the future success of such transactions would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with any such acquisitions or in-licensing. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of Taligen or Orphatec, or any other acquired businesses or companies work or be successful.

We compete with pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater resources than we for many of the same acquisition and in-licensing opportunities. Such pharmaceutical companies may be less
leveraged and have better access to capital resources that may preclude us from completing any acquisition or in-licensing. For this and other reasons, we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products
on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business, any acquired business or any acquired or in-licensed products may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may not have these necessary
funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest in our company, or securities
convertible into our capital stock, which could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interest in our company upon conversion.

Our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is a change in ownership of Alexion, or
if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.

As of December 31, 2010, we have approximately $579.3 million
of U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOL’s), available to reduce taxable income in future years. A portion of these NOL’s are currently subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. We believe it is more likely than not that we will use the net operating losses. However, the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards
may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income. NOL’s totaling $3.8 million expired in the year ended December 31, 2007. No NOL’s expired during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Our ability to utilize the NOL’s may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change, as defined in section 382. This ownership
change could be triggered by substantial changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock, which are generally outside of our control. An ownership change would exist if the stockholders, or group of stockholders, who own or have owned, directly or
indirectly, 5% or more of the value of our stock, or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under section 382 and the regulations promulgated there under, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points
over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change. In the event of an ownership change, section 382 imposes an
annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change NOL’s. The limitation imposed by section 382 for any post-change year would be determined by multiplying the value of our
stock immediately before the ownership change (subject to







certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased
by built-in gains which may be present with respect to assets held by us at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five-year period after the ownership change. Our use of NOL’s arising after the date of an ownership change
would not be affected.

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our results of
operations and financial position.

As a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well
as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with
respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements. If the Internal Revenue Service, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions taken by our company, we could have additional tax liability,
and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, the United States government and other governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide
tax liabilities and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our sales and operations are subject
to the economic, political, legal and business conditions in the countries in which we do business, and our failure to operate successfully or adapt to changes in these conditions could cause our sales and operations to be limited or disrupted.

Over the past few years, we have significantly expanded our operations and expect to continue to do so in the future.
Our operations in foreign countries subject us to the following additional risks:



•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;



•political or economic determinations that adversely impact pricing or reimbursement policies;



•economic problems or political instability that disrupt healthcare payment systems;



•difficulties or inability to obtain financing in markets;



•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;



•difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;



•changes in laws, regulations or enforcement practices with respect to our business, including without limitation laws relating to reimbursement,
competition, pricing and sales and marketing of our products;



•trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities;



•compliance with tax, employment and labor laws;



•costs and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and employees to manage and operate the business in local jurisdictions;



•costs and difficulties in managing and monitoring international operations; and



•longer payment cycles.

Our business and marketing methods are also subject to regulation by the governments of the countries in which we operate. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery
laws in other countries prohibit companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have policies and procedures designed to help
ensure that we and our representatives, including our employees, comply with such laws, however we cannot guarantee that these policies and procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other
anti-







bribery laws for actions taken by our representatives. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate could materially harm our business.

We conduct, or anticipate that we will conduct, a substantial portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily
the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and British Pound. While we attempt to hedge certain currency risks, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused foreign currency transaction gains and
losses in the past and will likely do so in the future. Likewise, past currency fluctuations have at times resulted in foreign currency transaction gains, and there can be no assurance that these gains can be reproduced.

The credit and financial market conditions may aggravate certain risks affecting our business.

Sales of Soliris are dependent, in large part, on reimbursement from government health administration organizations and private and
governmental third-party payors, and also co-payments from individual patients in certain situations. As a result of the current credit and financial market conditions, and the overall financial climate, these governmental organizations and payors,
and/or individuals, may reduce or delay initiation of treatment, may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations, may delay payment or may seek to reduce reimbursement for Soliris in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations. Payment defaults by a government payor could require us to expense previously recorded revenue as uncollectable, and might cause us to end or restrict sales to patients in that country. Further, the risk of
payment default by a government payor could require us to revise our revenue recognition policies in regard to that payor, causing revenue to be recorded only on a cash basis, and we may be required to end or restrict sales to patients in that
country.

Additionally, we rely upon third-parties for certain parts of our business, including Lonza, licensees, wholesale
distributors of Soliris, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and other third-party suppliers and financial institutions. Because of the recent volatility in the financial markets, there may be a disruption or delay in the
performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Government initiatives that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products could adversely affect our business.







Risks Related to Our Common Stock

If the trading price of our common stock continues to fluctuate in a wide range, our stockholders will suffer considerable uncertainty with respect
to an investment in our common stock.

The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be
volatile in the future. Factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors’ operating results or clinical or scientific results, fluctuations in the trading prices or business prospects of our competitors and collaborators,
changes in our prospects, particularly with respect to sales of Soliris, and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock and our convertible senior notes.
In particular, the trading price of the common stock of many biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose
stocks were affected. This is due to several factors, including general market conditions, sales of Soliris, the announcement of the results of our clinical trials or product development and the results of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval
for our products. In particular, between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010, the closing sales price of our common stock fluctuated from a low of $25.49 per share to a high of $82.34 per share. While we cannot predict our future
performance, if our stock price continues to fluctuate in a wide range, an investment in our common stock may result in considerable uncertainty for an investor.

Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholders’ rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult and may
frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management.

Because we are a Delaware corporation, the
anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware
General Laws, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our
outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

Our corporate charter and
by-law provisions and stockholder rights plan may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control that might be beneficial to us or our stockholders. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our
stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, or a majority of the Board of Directors, or upon the written request of stockholders who together own of record 50% of the outstanding stock of all classes
entitled to vote at such meeting. Our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Our certificate does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors, which
may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to elect one or more directors. Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to
designate up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may
be issued in the future.

Pursuant to our stockholder rights plan, each share of common stock has an associated preferred
stock purchase right. The rights will not trade separately from the common stock until, and are exercisable only upon, the acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of 20% or more of the outstanding common
stock. The rights are designed to make it more likely that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard against the use of partial tender offers or other coercive tactics to gain
control of us. These provisions could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over
then current prices. These provisions could also limit the ability of stockholders to remove current management or approve transactions that stockholders may deem to be in their best interests and could adversely affect the price of our common
stock.
